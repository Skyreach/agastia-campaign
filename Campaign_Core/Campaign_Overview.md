## Campaign Concept
A D&D campaign set in a world where merit-based advancement conflicts with growing social unrest, hidden cults spread chaos, and mysterious forces threaten the established order. The PCs navigate political intrigue, faction conflicts, and personal growth in a society struggling between order and chaos.

At the center of the campaign lies the Steel Dragon: a being living multiple incarnations, creating "artistic murders" that escalate to mass destruction, thriving in meritocracy while guided by anonymous supporters who control their motives across lifetimes.
