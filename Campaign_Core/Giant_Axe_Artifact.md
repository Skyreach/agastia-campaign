# Giant's Axe - Reality-Bleeding Artifact

## Player Summary

### Overview
A massive greataxe left by a storm giant at the site of Ratterdan's destruction. The weapon is "bleeding reality," causing temporal distortions and planar phenomena in the surrounding area. The patron wants the party to investigate and either retrieve or secure this dangerous artifact.

### Physical Description
- **Size:** Sized for a storm giant - massive compared to humanoid weapons
- **Material:** Unknown metal with bluish-silver sheen
- **Current State:** Embedded in the earth at Ratterdan's center
- **Visual Effects:** Reality appears to warp and shimmer around it

### Observable Phenomena
- **Temporal Distortions:** Time flows irregularly near the axe
- **Feywild Bleeding:** Upward-falling leaves in a pocket of Feywild energy
- **Reality Warping:** Visual distortions, "bleeding" effect around the weapon
- **Environmental Impact:** Smoking crater, destroyed buildings, warped ecosystem
- **Giant Tracks:** Evidence the storm giant left deliberately, not in flight

### Patron's Mission
The patron has hired the party to:
- Investigate what happened at Ratterdan
- Assess the axe and its effects
- Retrieve or secure the artifact if possible
- Report findings back to the patron

## DM Notes

### True Nature
The giant's axe is not merely abandoned - it was deliberately left to "bleed reality." The storm giant used it to destroy Ratterdan, then intentionally positioned it to create ongoing temporal and planar distortions.

### Reality-Bleeding Properties

**Dimensional Effects:**
- Creates weak points between Material Plane, Feywild, and potentially other planes
- Temporal distortions causing time to flow irregularly
- Manifestation of Feywild pockets and phenomena
- Local ecosystem becoming warped by planar bleed
- Possible beacon or anchor for something from another plane

**Effect Zones:**
- **Core (30 feet):** Severe temporal distortion, dangerous exposure
- **Transition (30-100 feet):** Moderate planar bleeding, environmental effects
- **Outer (100-300 feet):** Minor phenomena, subtle reality warping

### Storm Giant's Intent
**Critical Mystery:** Why did the giant leave such a dangerous artifact behind?

**Possible Explanations:**
- Deliberate marker or beacon
- Anchoring planar ritual or summoning
- Too dangerous even for the giant to keep
- Part of coordinated giant clan operation
- Bait to draw specific individuals or forces

### Investigation Clues

**Physical Evidence:**
- Giant tracks show deliberate placement, standing and observing
- Zhaask (Draconic) symbols etched near the axe base
- Signs others attempted approach but retreated
- Temporal patterns suggest intentional calibration
- No signs of battle - destruction was methodical

**Zhaask Symbols:**
Draconic runes that might translate to:
- Location coordinates or planar addresses
- Warning messages or prophecy
- Names (Steel Dragon? Giant's identity?)
- Instructions for those who know how to read them
- Temporal markers or countdown

### Personal Clues by Character
Each PC might receive unique insights based on background:

- **Manny:** Recognition of craftsmanship beyond normal giant smithing, techniques that suggest ancient traditions
- **Nikki (Biago):** Arcane signatures feel familiar, like something from their past or training
- **Rakash:** Instinctive understanding of the giant's emotional state when it left - purposeful, not fearful
- **Kyle/Nameless:** Rainbow nature resonates with planar bleeding, uncomfortable familiarity
- **Josh:** Mysterious markings might glow, tingle, or react to temporal distortions

### Connection to Campaign Mysteries

**Potential Links:**
- **Steel Dragon:** Temporal distortion could relate to reincarnation mechanism
- **The Codex:** Might the Dominion Evolution Codex explain or control such artifacts?
- **Decimate Project:** Is Professor Zero seeking reality-bleeding phenomena?
- **Josh's Markings:** Reaction to temporal/planar energies suggests deeper connection
- **Chaos Cult:** Would they exploit or amplify these reality-warping effects?
- **Giant Clans:** Part of larger giant operation across multiple sites?

### Session 1 Encounters & Challenges

**Environmental Hazards:**
- Temporal distortion zones requiring saves or skill checks
- Reality warps creating difficult terrain or illusions
- Feywild influence affecting emotions or perceptions
- Unstable ground from crater and destruction

**Potential Combat:**
- Temporal wisps (adapted creatures drawn to distortions)
- Warped local creatures with displaced/aberrant traits
- Rival seekers attempting to claim the axe
- Ecosystem predators mutated by planar bleed

**Investigation Opportunities:**
- Examining giant tracks and destruction patterns
- Translating or copying Zhaask symbols
- Testing temporal distortion boundaries
- Documenting phenomena for patron's report

### Patron's Interest
The patron's motivation should connect to their identity:

- **Academic:** Studying unprecedented planar phenomena
- **Safety Concern:** Preventing artifact from falling into wrong hands
- **Personal Connection:** Related to patron's background or secret knowledge
- **Faction Directive:** Merit Council, Decimate Project, or other orders
- **Hidden Agenda:** Knows more about giant's plan than revealed

### Current Status (Level 2 Party)

**Challenges:**
- Axe is sized for storm giant - currently unusable by party
- Reality-bleeding effects dangerous to approach unprepared
- Retrieval would require magical means or exceptional strength
- Full understanding beyond current party capabilities

**Realistic Outcomes:**
- Document location and phenomena
- Copy Zhaask symbols for later translation
- Secure area or warn others away
- Follow giant's trail to learn more
- Return to patron with findings

**Future Possibilities:**
- Return at higher level with proper equipment
- Research leads to understanding and safe retrieval
- Giant's plan unfolds, changing the situation
- Other factions make moves on the artifact
- Connection to larger plot becomes clear

### Long-Term Campaign Role

**Developing Mystery:**
- Key to understanding storm giant plots
- Evidence of cross-planar conspiracy
- Component for larger magical working
- Connection to Steel Dragon's reincarnation
- Part of network of similar artifacts

**Decision Point:**
Session 1 establishes this as significant beyond immediate resolution, creating:
- Ongoing investigation opportunity
- Reason to grow stronger and return
- Multiple faction interest hooks
- Personal stakes for each PC
- Connection between immediate adventure and campaign arc

### Mechanical Notes for Session 1

**Artifact Properties (If Examined):**
At level 2, PCs can determine:
- Requires giant size or transformation magic to wield
- Ancient creation, not recent craft
- Intentionally positioned for specific effect
- Extremely dangerous to approach carelessly
- Beyond their current ability to safely move

**Future Power Potential:**
When/if PCs can eventually claim it:
- Plane-shifting or dimensional manipulation
- Temporal effects (advanced haste/slow or more exotic)
- Reality-warping strikes
- Connection to giant magic and primordial forces
- Awakening properties tied to campaign progression
