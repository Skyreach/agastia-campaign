- Anonymous supporters might already possess or seek it
- Could be how they control Dragon's motives across lifetimes

**Giant Clans:**

- Storm giant's actions at Ratterdan might connect
- Could explain giant magic and primordial forces

### Late Campaign Resolution
- **Discovery:** Finding the actual Codex

## Development Notes

**Status:** While the Codex is established as important to the campaign (Professor Zero's search, Manny and Nikki's missions), its exact nature and specific role remain flexible for optimal campaign integration.

**Priority:** Define concrete details as Professor Zero becomes more active in the campaign, Manny and Nikki pursue their missions, or other plot threads create natural connections to dominion evolution themes.

**Themes to Consider:**
- Evolution of power and control
- Transformation across lifetimes (Steel Dragon)
- Merit-based vs. other forms of dominion
- Knowledge as power and danger
- Who should control transformative information
