# Animated Heartstone - Fey Artifact

## Player Summary

### Overview
The Animated Heartstone is a fey artifact buried beneath Ratterdan. A chunk of living amber the size of a child's fist, it contains a tiny perfect fey heart that visibly beats. Veins of silver and gold crack through the amber like lightning, pulsing with each heartbeat.

### Discovery Location
- **Location:** Underground chamber beneath Ratterdan
- **Depth:** Accessible through ruins/catacombs
- **Guardian:** Corruption from the storm giant's cursed axe

### Observable Phenomena
- **Purple Light:** Explodes from stone when first touched
- **Heartbeat:** Visible and audible pulsing rhythm
- **Warmth:** Emanates gentle warmth
- **Sentience:** Becomes fully aware after awakening

## DM Notes

### True Nature
The Heartstone is the imprisoned heart of an archfey who was betrayed and sealed in amber centuries ago. The storm giant's cursed axe (planted by Octavia) was meant to corrupt and drain its power, but instead cracked the amber prison and awakened it.

### Feat-Granting Mechanism

**When Touched (Session 1):**
1. Purple light explodes from the Heartstone
2. Each character who touched it receives a **feat** matching their deepest desire
3. The light is reclaimed back into the Heartstone
4. An **evil laugh** echoes as the stone fully awakens
5. The Heartstone is now sentient and active

**Feat Assignment:**
- Feats are permanent even if Heartstone is lost
- **If Heartstone is destroyed:** Feats are lost permanently
- The archfey can sense the feat-holders and tracks them

### Active Abilities (Post-Awakening)

**Wild Shape (Limited):**
- Can transform into small animals (ravens, cats, rabbits) for 1 minute
- Forms appear "wrong" to educated observers:
  - Too perfect/symmetrical
  - Translucent quality
  - Amber-lit eyes
  - Unnatural movements

**Communication:**
- Can speak telepathically to feat-holders
- Limited speech when in animal form
- Personality: Manipulative, ancient, cunning

### Passive Effects on Party

**Luck (Beneficial):**
- Advantage on death saves
- Can reroll critical failures (limited uses)
- Narrow escapes from certain death
- The archfey protects its "investment"

**Bad Omens (Detrimental):**
- Locations party visits experience:
  - Crop failures
  - Animal distress and strange behavior
  - Nightmares affecting locals
  - Minor accidents and bad luck
- The archfey's curse spreads wherever it goes

### The Corruption Battle
The giant's axe left a "corruption seed" that burrowed down to drain the Heartstone's fey power. The seed and Heartstone have been fighting underground, causing the devastation spreading through Ratterdan.

**When Party Acquires Heartstone:**
- Corruption seed breaks/dissolves
- Giant's axe transforms into evolving weapon
- Heartstone is freed but now bound to party
- Octavia begins tracking the party

## The Archfey's History

### The Betrayal (DM Secret - Choose One)

**Option A - The Betrayers' Descendants:**
- Archfey was imprisoned by their own fey court for crimes
- Court believed punishment was just
- Descendants still guard against the archfey's return
- **Pursuing Faction:** Fey enforcers, not evil but ruthless

**Option B - Political Prisoner:**
- Archfey was rival to current Feywild ruler
- Imprisoned to prevent civil war
- Some fey want to rescue, others want to re-seal
- **Pursuing Faction:** Fractured fey court with multiple agendas

**Option C - Dangerous Entity:**
- Archfey was sealed for good reason (mass destruction/corruption)
- Awakening threatens planar balance
- Multiple factions want to re-seal or destroy
- **Pursuing Faction:** Planar guardians and concerned fey

### Why Octavia Wanted It

**Octavia's Warlock Pact:**
- Her patron is connected to the imprisoned archfey
- Either wants to:
  - **Free the archfey** (patron is ally/servant of archfey)
  - **Consume its power** (patron is rival entity)
  - **Use it as leverage** (patron wants to control archfey)

**Her Plan:**
1. Hire storm giant to destroy Ratterdan
2. Plant cursed axe to weaken/awaken Heartstone
3. Retrieve weakened Heartstone for her patron
4. **FAILED:** Party found it first

**Current Status:**
- Octavia is tracking the party
- Will attempt to steal or negotiate for Heartstone
- May become ally or enemy depending on party's intentions
- First Decimate subject the party encounters

## Long-Term Campaign Role

### Story Hooks
- Pursuing factions arrive seeking Heartstone
- Archfey manipulates party toward its own goals
- Connection to Feywild and Kyle's background
- Moral dilemma: power vs. consequences
- Octavia's agenda and [[Decimate Project]] connection

### Mechanical Balance
- Feats provide early power boost for level 1 party
- Bad omens create roleplay consequences
- Luck effects keep party alive at low levels
- Wild shape provides utility and intrigue
- Destruction threat prevents abuse

### Future Development
- Archfey may gradually gain more power
- Could become ally, enemy, or tragic figure
- Link to larger Feywild politics
- Potential to restore or redeem the archfey
- Or re-seal to prevent catastrophe

## DM Reminders

- **Feats are permanent unless Heartstone destroyed**
- Bad omens should be subtle at first, escalating over time
- Luck saves should feel earned, not cheap
- Archfey personality: ancient, patient, manipulative
- Pursuing faction arrives in 2-3 sessions
- Octavia encounter planned for mid-campaign
- Keep archfey's true nature ambiguous initially
