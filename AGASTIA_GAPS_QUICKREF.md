## CONTINUITY ISSUE (Resolve Before Players Visit)

### 5. Restaurant Name Inconsistency
**Issue:** Nikki's family restaurant has two names
**Session 2 Name:** "Il Drago Rosso (The Red Dragon)"
**Current File:** `Shop_The_Delizioso_Trattoria.md`

**File Path:** `/mnt/e/dnd/agastia-campaign/Locations/Cities/Agastia/Shop_The_Delizioso_Trattoria.md`

---

## MINOR GAPS (Optional/Low Priority)

### 6. Location: Warehouse 7
**Status:** Referenced extensively but no dedicated file
**Option 1:** Include in Geist's NPC file (if not combat location)
**Option 2:** Create standalone location file (if becomes dungeon/encounter)
**Urgency:** LOW - can be improvised

### 7. Location: The Gilded Gryphon Inn
**Status:** Mentioned in Session 2, file existence unclear
**Urgency:** LOW - generic inn, easy to improvise

### 8. NPC: Brian Thornscale (Mayor)
**Status:** Mentioned once as Meridian's Rest mayor
**Urgency:** VERY LOW - minor NPC, may not need file
