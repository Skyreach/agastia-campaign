# Bloody - Heartstone Companion

## Overview

**Bloody** is a crystalline red demonic cat that emerged when a mysterious heartstone transformed during Session 1's shadow dungeon encounter. The heartstone, initially discovered in the depths beneath Ratterdan, absorbed shadow energy and underwent a dramatic metamorphosis, creating a sentient feline companion with an otherworldly appearance.

### Basic Information
- **Form:** Crystalline red demonic cat
- **Origin:** Transformed heartstone from shadow dungeon
- **Size:** Small (housecat-sized)
- **Appearance:** Translucent red crystalline body, demonic features, glowing eyes
- **Personality:** [To be developed through play]

## Transformation Event (Session 1)

During the party's exploration of the shadow dungeon beneath Ratterdan, a heartstone was discovered embedded in the corruption. As the party fought shadow creatures, the stone began absorbing energy from the environment. At a critical moment, it shattered and reformed into Bloody - a living crystalline cat with demonic characteristics.
