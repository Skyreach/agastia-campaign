# [[The Codex]] of Peace

## Player Summary

**The Codex of Peace** (also known as the **Dominion Evolution Codex**) is an ancient tome of immense power, sought by [[Professor Zero]] for unknown purposes. The artifact is said to contain knowledge of evolution, transformation, and change — magic that grants dominion over life and growth itself. Legends describe it as impossibly well-preserved despite its age, with pages that appear blank until read by a "worthy" individual.

[[Manny]] (#1) and [[Nikki]] (#2) have been dispatched by [[Professor Zero]] to locate and retrieve the Codex, though its true contents and purpose remain unknown to them. Garrek's journal mentions an "ancient book at the Falls," potentially referencing this artifact.
