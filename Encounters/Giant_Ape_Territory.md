# Giant Ape Territory

**Roll:** 16 on 2d10

The jungle shakes with mighty roars. An enormous silverback ape crashes through vegetation, beating its chest in threat display. It views the party as rivals or threats to its family group.

**Variation:** A mated pair with young attack together (overwhelming action economy), or the ape has been magically enhanced by a druid.

**Non-Combat:** Submissive postures and backing away (DC 15 Animal Handling or Intimidation to out-alpha) makes it accept dominance display. It won't pursue beyond its territory. Defeating it non-lethally earns respect—”it might even help against a greater threat.
