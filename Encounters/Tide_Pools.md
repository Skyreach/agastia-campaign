# Tide Pools

**Roll:** 5 on 2d8

Beautiful tide pools dot the rocky shore, filled with colorful fish, anemones, and shells. Steam mephits play in warm pools created by volcanic vents.

**Variation:** One pool contains a water weird, or the mephits guard a valuable pearl (worth 50 gp).

**Non-Combat:** Playing with the mephits (Performance, Athletics, or engaging with their games) earns goodwill—”they show the party which pool contains oysters with pearls (2d4 pearls worth 10 gp each). The pools can provide fresh shellfish (2 days rations).
