# Poisonous Snakes

**Roll:** 8 on 2d6

The waters teem with serpents—”regular and giant poisonous snakes coil around cypress knees and hang from branches. Their territory must be crossed.

**Variation:** A yuan-ti pureblood has charmed them as guardians, or they protect a sunken shrine containing treasure.

**Non-Combat:** Using repellent herbs (DC 12 Nature to identify/prepare), smoke, or fire clears a path. Wading carefully (DC 13 Stealth group check) disturbs them minimally. The snakes can be harvested for venom after combat (3d4 doses worth 10 gp each).
