# Death Dogs

**Roll:** 11 on 2d8

Snarling two-headed hounds bound across the dunes, their disease-ridden bites a serious threat. They're hunting something (fleeing merchants, escaped slaves, or just prey) and the party is in the way.

**Variation:** A gnoll packmaster controls them, or they're infected with a supernatural disease that animates their corpses as zombies if killed.

**Non-Combat:** Throwing poisoned meat (requires poison, rations, and DC 12 Nature check) neutralizes them. Intimidation (DC 14) makes them wary of stronger predators.
