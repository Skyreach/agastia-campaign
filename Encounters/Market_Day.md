# Market Day

**Roll:** 5 on 2d10

The marketplace bustles with activity—”vendors hawking wares, performers entertaining, pickpockets working crowds. It's colorful chaos.

**Variation:** A disguised doppelganger is replacing a merchant, or a guard patrol is shaking down vendors for "protection money."

**Non-Combat:** Shopping offers chances to buy supplies at normal prices, gather rumors (every merchant knows something), establish contacts, or notice crimes in progress. A DC 13 Perception check spots pickpockets (confronting them might lead to thieves' guild). The party can also sell loot or buy information (10 gp gets specific rumors).
