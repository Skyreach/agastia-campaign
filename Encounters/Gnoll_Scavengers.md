# Gnoll Scavengers

**Roll:** 7 on 2d8

Hyena laughter echoes across dunes. Gnolls pick through the remains of a merchant caravan, fighting over scraps. They haven't noticed the party yet, but gnolls are always hungry for more.

**Variation:** A gnoll fang of Yeenoghu leads them (more powerful, demonic influence), or giant hyenas accompany them.

**Non-Combat:** Sneaking past (DC 14 group Stealth) avoids the fight. Waiting until they leave allows looting what remains (2d10 gp, damaged trade goods).
