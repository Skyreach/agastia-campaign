# Mountain Goat Herd

**Roll:** 4 on 2d10

Sure-footed goats traverse impossible cliff faces, grazing on sparse mountain vegetation. A golden goat with unusual markings leads the herd—”local legend says it brings good fortune.

**Variation:** The golden goat is actually a polymorphed gold dragon wyrmling observing humanoids.

**Non-Combat:** Following the goats reveals a safe path through treacherous terrain. The golden goat's tracks lead to a hidden shrine where offerings grant a blessing (advantage on next ability check to avoid falling).
