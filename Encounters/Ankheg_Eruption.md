# Ankheg Eruption

**Roll:** 15 on 2d8

The ground trembles and explodes upward as an ankheg bursts from below, mandibles clacking. Its carapace bears strange metal tags—”someone has been studying it.

**Variation:** The ankheg is protecting its burrowed eggs (3 eggs worth 100 gp each to scholars or tamers).

**Non-Combat:** Investigations reveal the tags bear a wizard's mark; following the trail leads to an eccentric researcher who will pay 50 gp for information on the ankheg's behavior and location.
