# Giant Scorpion Ambush

**Roll:** 15 on 2d8

Sand explodes as a giant scorpion erupts from beneath, pincers snapping and poisonous tail arcing. It's been lying in wait near the only water source for miles.

**Variation:** Two giant scorpions hunt together, or it's protecting young (smaller scorpions that swarm).

**Non-Combat:** Approaching the water source carefully (DC 16 Perception spots the trap). Smoking it out or creating vibrations elsewhere (distant noise, thrown rocks) triggers the ambush early, allowing avoidance.
