# Green Dragon Wyrmling

**Roll:** 18 on 2d10

Acrid fog rolls through the jungle. A green dragon wyrmling perches on a branch, studying the party with ancient, cunning eyes. Unlike brutish white dragons, it enjoys manipulation and deals—”for the right price.

**Variation:** It's using the party to eliminate a rival (another predator, yuan-ti scout party), or it has charmed a local tribe to serve it.

**Non-Combat:** Negotiation, flattery, and information-trading can work (DC 14 Persuasion, easier with valuable information or tribute). It might demand tribute (one magic item or 50 gp in gems) for safe passage, or offer a deal: eliminate its rival for promised treasure. Its breath weapon makes it dangerous, so it knows it has leverage.
