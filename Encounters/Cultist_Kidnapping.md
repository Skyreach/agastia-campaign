# Cultist Kidnapping

**Roll:** 19 on 2d10

Cultists attempt to grab a merchant in broad daylight—”a former member who left the cult two years ago when it was just a social club. They're desperate and poorly organized.

**Variation:** The cult serves a powerful demon (much more dangerous), or the merchant is actually a spy who infiltrated them.

**Non-Combat:** Intervening scares off the cultists (they're not combat-trained). The merchant explains the cult's growth into something darker, providing information about their location, membership, and goals. The city guard is corrupt and won't help. This becomes an adventure hook.
