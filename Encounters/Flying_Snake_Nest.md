# Flying Snake Nest

**Roll:** 10 on 2d10

Colorful serpents glide between branches, their wings catching sunlight. They're beautiful but venomous, defending their nesting area aggressively.

**Variation:** One snake is magically enhanced (double HP, improved poison) by a local druid, or they guard rare orchids worth 50 gp to alchemists.

**Non-Combat:** *Speak with animals* reveals they just want to be left alone. Climbing around their territory (DC 14 Athletics) avoids confrontation. Their shed skins can be harvested for poison-making materials.
