# Tribal Warriors

**Roll:** 6 on 2d10

Face-painted warriors melt out of the jungle, spears ready. They're protecting their territory from outsiders but aren't automatically hostile—”they want to understand the party's intentions.

**Variation:** They're hunting a dangerous predator (tyrannosaur, giant ape) and could use help, or they're fleeing from yuan-ti slavers.

**Non-Combat:** Communication through gestures and gifts (DC 13 Persuasion) establishes peaceful contact. They can provide guides, trade goods, warn about dangers (particularly carnivorous plants and dinosaurs), and might request help with a problem.
