# Mammoth Migration

**Roll:** 6 on 2d6

The ground shakes with rhythmic thuds. A small herd of mammoths crosses the tundra, their thick fur crusted with ice. A calf stumbles, struggling to keep up.

**Variation:** One mammoth is injured by hunters' spears and is dangerously aggressive.

**Non-Combat:** Helping the calf (physically assisting it or clearing its path) earns the herd's tolerance; the matriarch's dung can be harvested for excellent fire-starting material (advantage on Survival checks to start fires in cold weather).
