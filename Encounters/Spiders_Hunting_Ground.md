# Spider's Hunting Ground

**Roll:** 9 on 2d8

Massive webs stretch between ancient oaks, glistening with dew. Giant wolf spiders lurk in the canopy, and cocooned corpses dangle from branches—”some still twitching. An ettercap commands the spiders from a higher perch, chittering orders.

**Variation:** One cocoon contains a still-living noble who will pay handsomely for rescue (or the spiders are defending egg sacs that will hatch in days, flooding the forest).

**Non-Combat:** Sneaking through (DC 15 Stealth group check) or using fire to clear a safe path avoids the fight; investigating cocoons yields 2d20 gp in valuables.
