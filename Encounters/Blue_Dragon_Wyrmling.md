# Blue Dragon Wyrmling

**Roll:** 14 on 2d8

Thunder cracks as a vain blue dragon wyrmling circles overhead, studying the party with calculating eyes. Unlike savage white dragons, it's intelligent and might negotiate—”for the right price.

**Variation:** It's accompanied by kobold cultists who worship it, or it's young enough to be overconfident and underestimate the party.

**Non-Combat:** Flattery and tribute (gems worth 50+ gp, magical items, or secrets/information) satisfy its vanity. It might even provide information about dangers ahead, warn about rivals, or safe passage through its territory in exchange for future tribute.
