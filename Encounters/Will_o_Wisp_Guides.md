# Will-o'-Wisp Guides

**Roll:** 2 on 2d6

Ghostly lights dance across the misty fen, beckoning the party to follow. Unlike most will-o'-wisps, these lights actually lead to safety—”a dry island with an ancient shrine offering rest and clean water.

**Variation:** The wisps are the spirits of helpful dead who want travelers to find safety, or they're testing the party before leading them to treasure.

**Non-Combat:** Following the lights (DC 12 Insight to trust them, or DC 14 Survival to verify they're leading somewhere safe) reveals the shrine. Leaving an offering (10 gp in coins) grants a blessing (advantage on saves against disease for 24 hours). Ignoring them means missing the safe rest spot.
