# Merchant Caravan

**Roll:** 3 on 2d8

A noble merchant traveling with guards leads a caravan of camels across the sands. They're friendly and willing to trade (at steep prices), share news, and warnings about dangers ahead.

**Variation:** One of the guards is a bandit captain planning to betray and rob the merchant at nightfall, or bandits are tracking the caravan.

**Non-Combat:** Trading goods, providing protection, or warning about dangers earns discounts and a potential recurring NPC merchant contact. The merchant knows all regional rumors.
