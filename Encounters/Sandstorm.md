# Sandstorm

**Roll:** 10 on 2d8

Dark clouds appear on the horizon—”a massive sandstorm approaches. Without shelter, the party faces 1d6 hours of blinding sand, exhaustion, and getting hopelessly lost.

**Variation:** The sandstorm is unnatural, created by an efreeti or air elemental, or it hides the approach of a blue dragon wyrmling who hunts during storms.

**Non-Combat:** Finding shelter (DC 15 Survival) provides safety. Magic like *wind wall* or *gust of wind* can carve a safe zone. The storm passes, revealing previously buried ruins or an oasis.
