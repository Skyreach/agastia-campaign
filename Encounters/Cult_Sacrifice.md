# Cult Sacrifice

**Roll:** 10 on 2d6

Torchlight flickers through the mist. A cult fanatic and robed followers prepare to sacrifice a terrified kobold on a stone altar to a dark god. The kobold is somehow immune to piercing damage and keeps screaming.

**Variation:** The kobold is actually a polymorphed noble, or the cult serves a black dragon who watches from nearby.

**Non-Combat:** Disrupting the ceremony (loud noise, attacks, magic) breaks the ritual—cultists might flee if their leader falls. The kobold, if saved, knows the location of the cult's hidden temple (containing 4d20 gp and dark relics). Sneaking close (DC 14 Stealth) allows ambushing the distracted cultists.
