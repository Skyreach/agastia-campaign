# Giant Frogs

**Roll:** 4 on 2d6

Lazy croaking echoes from oversized lily pads. Giant toads and frogs sun themselves, occasionally snapping at passing dragonflies. They're lethargic and well-fed.

**Variation:** One frog has a ruby in its belly from a previous meal (worth 100 gp, visible through translucent stomach), or they guard a submerged chest.

**Non-Combat:** Walking quietly past (DC 12 Stealth) doesn't disturb them. One frog might belch up a valuable gem as the party passes—”a lucky omen. Their slime can be harvested for alchemical ingredients (DC 12 Nature check, produces 2d4 doses of poison antidote material).
