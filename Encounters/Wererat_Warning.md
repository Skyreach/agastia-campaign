# Wererat Warning

**Roll:** 13 on 2d10

A mousy man in rags sells "yesterday's fish for today's prices" from a cart. He's actually a wererat trying to warn the party about a dangerous area ahead (rival gang, guard trap, etc.).

**Variation:** He's trying to lead them into an ambush, or he wants to recruit them for the wererat gang.

**Non-Combat:** Recognizing what he is (DC 14 Insight) allows reading his true intentions. If genuinely helpful, he provides accurate information about criminal territories, guard patrol routes, and sewer passages. He might offer to fence stolen goods at 60% value or trade information for disease cures.
