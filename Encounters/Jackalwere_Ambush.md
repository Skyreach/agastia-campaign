# Jackalwere Ambush

**Roll:** 9 on 2d8

Jackals circle the party, seeming curious rather than aggressive. When the party makes camp or lets their guard down, they shift to humanoid form and attack, trying to steal supplies rather than kill.

**Variation:** They serve a lamia who watches from a distant dune, or they're recruiting for a larger jackalwere pack.

**Non-Combat:** Detecting their true nature (DC 14 Insight or Arcana) allows preparation. They flee if seriously injured, leading back to their lair (containing stolen goods worth 4d10 gp).
