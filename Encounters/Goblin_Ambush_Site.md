# Goblin Ambush Site

**Roll:** 8 on 2d8

The forest goes silent. Worg tracks and goblin footprints surround a freshly dug pit covered with branches and leaves. Crude wooden spikes line the bottom (2d6 piercing damage, DC 12 Dex save to avoid). Goblins watch from the bushes, hoping their trap succeeds.

**Variation:** Instead of a few goblins, a bugbear leads the ambush party, using the goblins as expendable shock troops.

**Non-Combat:** Keen-eyed characters (DC 14 Perception) spot the trap before triggering it and can either avoid it, disarm it, or turn it against pursuers.
