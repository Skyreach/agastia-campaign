# Pirate Raid

**Roll:** 15 on 2d8

The skull-and-crossbones flag appears on the horizon. A pirate crew (bandit captain + 2d4 bandits) rows to shore in longboats, looking for plunder and ale. They're ruthless but predictable.

**Variation:** A berserker serves as the ship's champion, or a spy (skilled infiltrator) leads them.

**Non-Combat:** If the party has a ship, negotiation or shows of strength might work (DC 14 Intimidation or Persuasion). Pirates respect power and profit—”offering information about better targets, sharing ale, or demonstrating combat prowess might turn them friendly or at least neutral. They know all local coastal secrets and smuggling routes.
