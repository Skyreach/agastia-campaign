# Orc Raiding Party

**Roll:** 12 on 2d6

Battle-scarred orcs pursue a lone polar bear through the snow, hooting with excitement. They're from a larger war band and are testing their courage. When they see the party, they turn their attention to "better prey."

**Variation:** An orc war chief (use orog stats) leads them, making the fight significantly harder.

**Non-Combat:** Challenging their leader to single combat (champion vs. champion) satisfies their honor; defeating or impressing them gains their respect and they leave peacefully, possibly offering information about the area.
