# Kobold Trappers

**Roll:** 8 on 2d10

Crude snares and tripwires litter the narrow path. Kobolds watch from concealed positions in the rocks, ready to spring their trap—”a net drop and spike pit combo. They serve a white dragon wyrmling in the higher peaks.

**Variation:** A winged kobold (urd) leads them, using hit-and-run tactics from above.

**Non-Combat:** Spotting the traps (DC 14 Perception) allows avoidance. Intimidating the kobolds (DC 13 Intimidation, easier if dragon-related) makes them flee; their lair contains small treasures (2d20 gp).
