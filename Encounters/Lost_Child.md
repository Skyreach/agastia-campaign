# Lost Child

**Roll:** 4 on 2d10

A noble's child, dressed in fine clothes, cries in an alley. They're lost and scared after getting separated from their parents at the market.

**Variation:** The child is a disguised imp gathering intelligence, or kidnapping victim being tracked by the thieves who took them.

**Non-Combat:** Returning the child safely to their estate earns a 50 gp reward plus a grateful noble family's favor (useful for social encounters). If an imp, detecting it (DC 14 Insight) prevents falling for its ruse. The kidnapping scenario offers a choice: return for reward or follow to the hideout.
