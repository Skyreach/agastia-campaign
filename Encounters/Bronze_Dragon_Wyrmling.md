# Bronze Dragon Wyrmling

**Roll:** 3 on 2d8

A young metallic dragon basks on sunny rocks, its bronze scales gleaming. It's curious about surface dwellers and enjoys conversation, riddles, and tests of wit.

**Variation:** It's polymorphed into a human sailor and only reveals itself if impressed, or it's being hunted by sahuagin and needs help.

**Non-Combat:** Engaging in friendly conversation, sharing stories, or solving its riddles earns its friendship. It might offer advice about coastal dangers, point toward underwater treasures, or grant a scale that provides limited water breathing (1 use, 10 minutes). Good-aligned and genuinely helpful.
