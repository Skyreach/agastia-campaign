# Polar Bear Hunt

**Roll:** 8 on 2d6

Fresh blood stains the snow. A polar bear has killed a seal and is feeding, but it notices the party. It's protective of its meal but not immediately hostile.

**Variation:** The bear is a dire polar bear (double HP, extra damage die) or a werebear in animal form who can be reasoned with.

**Non-Combat:** Giving the bear space (backing away slowly, DC 12 group Stealth check) lets everyone avoid conflict. The seal carcass can be harvested for food and valuable blubber.
