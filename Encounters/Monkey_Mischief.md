# Monkey Mischief

**Roll:** 7 on 2d10

Chattering, screeching monkeys (use baboon stats) swarm through the canopy, stealing anything shiny or edible. They're more annoying than dangerous, but they're persistent thieves.

**Variation:** A giant ape leads them, or they're fleeing from a predator (giant snake, panther) that arrives soon.

**Non-Combat:** Offering food as a distraction works temporarily. Following them leads to their nest, which contains 3d20 gp worth of stolen trinkets and coins. Befriending them (DC 14 Animal Handling) makes them potential scouts/alarm systems.
