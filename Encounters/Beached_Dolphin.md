# Beached Dolphin

**Roll:** 4 on 2d8

A dolphin thrashes weakly on the beach, stranded by the tide. It's intelligent and desperate, making pitiful noises. Sea birds circle overhead.

**Variation:** The dolphin is actually polymorphed druid, or returning it to water earns the attention of a grateful nereid who grants a boon.

**Non-Combat:** Returning it to water (DC 12 Athletics to move it safely) earns potential future aid—”dolphins remember kindness. If polymorphed druid, immediate reward of spell or information. The dolphin might lead to underwater treasure or warn about nearby predators.
