# Corrupted Grove

**Roll:** 14 on 2d8

A massive oak dominates a darkened grove, its trunk split and oozing shadow. Needle blights, twig blights, and vine blights emerge from the corruption, attacking mindlessly. At the center, liquid shadow bubbles from the tree's wound.

**Variation:** The corruption is spreading—”a young gulthias tree is taking root, and if not destroyed, will spawn more blights weekly.

**Non-Combat:** A DC 14 Nature or Religion check reveals the corruption can be cleansed with holy water and fire; doing so without fighting requires stealth (DC 16) but destroys the threat permanently.
