# Yuan-ti Ambush

**Roll:** 20 on 2d10

Serpentine figures emerge from concealment—”yuan-ti purebloods backed by tribal warriors they've charmed or enslaved. They seek captives for sacrifice or slaves for their temple city.

**Variation:** A yuan-ti malison leads them (more powerful, magic), or they guard the approach to a major yuan-ti stronghold.

**Non-Combat:** Displaying snake-related symbols or claiming to serve "the Scaled Ones" (DC 15 Deception) might gain temporary standing. They value cunning and ruthlessness—”convincing them the party is more useful as allies than slaves (DC 16 Persuasion) could work. Escape is possible if the party flees immediately—”yuan-ti won't pursue far from their territory without good reason. Their goal is securing the temple, not chasing random adventurers.
