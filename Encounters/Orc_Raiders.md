# Orc Raiders

**Roll:** 10 on 2d10

A band of orcs picks through the wreckage of a merchant caravan, arguing over loot. They're from a larger mountain tribe and view the party as either more plunder or a worthy fight.

**Variation:** An orog leads them with tactical precision, or they have captured prisoners they're preparing to ransom or enslave.

**Non-Combat:** If the party rescued the prisoners quietly or convinces the orcs they're not worth fighting (DC 14 Intimidation/Persuasion, showing strength), the orcs might even trade information about safe paths for goods.
