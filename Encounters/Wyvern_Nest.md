# Wyvern Nest

**Roll:** 18 on 2d10

A wyvern roosts on a high ledge, its poisonous tail dripping venom. It watches the party with predatory intelligence but hasn't committed to attacking yet—”it's well-fed from a recent kill.

**Variation:** The wyvern is protecting eggs (worth 200 gp each to collectors) or is injured and cornered, making it more dangerous.

**Non-Combat:** Staying low and quiet (DC 15 Stealth group check) lets the party pass beneath without drawing attention. The wyvern's recent kill (visible on the ledge) is a merchant whose pack contains valuables.
