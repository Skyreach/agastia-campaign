# Goblin Ice-Fishers

**Roll:** 5 on 2d6

A group of goblins huddle around holes in the ice, fishing with crude spears. They're desperate, half-starved, and argue over every small catch. They've been exiled from their tribe for incompetence.

**Variation:** A winter wolf stalks them from a distance, planning to attack—”the goblins and party might have to work together.

**Non-Combat:** Sharing food or teaching better fishing techniques (DC 12 Survival) makes them grateful; they share rumors of a frozen ship in the ice containing supplies.
