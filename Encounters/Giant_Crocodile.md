# Giant Crocodile

**Roll:** 11 on 2d6

A massive crocodile lies submerged in apparently safe-looking water, only its eyes visible. It's patient, waiting for prey to cross. Its teeth are allegedly haunted.

**Variation:** The crocodile is enormous (add 20 HP, extra damage), or multiple crocodiles work together (mated pair).

**Non-Combat:** Spotting it (DC 15 Perception) allows finding another crossing. Throwing substantial meat (5 days rations) distracts it long enough to cross safely. Its territory can be marked on maps—”the teeth claim is false, but locals pay for that information.
