# Haunted House

**Roll:** 11 on 2d10

An abandoned building looms over the street. Locals claim it's haunted—”and they're right. Ghosts and shadows lurk within, but so does forgotten treasure.

**Variation:** A banshee haunts the upper floors, or the "ghosts" are actually burglars using fear to keep people away.

**Non-Combat:** Investigating reveals the building's tragic history. Laying the spirits to rest (proper burial, solving their murder, returning stolen items) grants their blessing and access to hidden treasure (4d20 gp, possibly magic item). Sneaking past the ghosts (DC 15 Stealth) allows looting without confrontation.
