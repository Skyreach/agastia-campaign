# Ogre Ambush

**Roll:** 16 on 2d10

A massive boulder flies toward the party—”an ogre attacks from higher ground, hurling rocks before closing for melee. Its cave lair is visible behind it, filled with bones and stolen goods.

**Variation:** Two ogres work together, or the ogre has captured a prize prisoner (noble, merchant) worth ransom.

**Non-Combat:** The ogre is stupid and easily tricked (DC 12 Deception)—”convincing it the party works for someone scarier makes it back down. Its lair contains 4d20 gp and random equipment from victims.
