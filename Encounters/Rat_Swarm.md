# Rat Swarm

**Roll:** 12 on 2d10

The sewers have erupted—”giant rat swarms pour from drainage grates, fleeing something worse below. They're terrified, not aggressive.

**Variation:** Wererats drove them out to cover their own escape, or an otyugh has invaded their territory.

**Non-Combat:** The rats flee past if not provoked. Following them into sewers leads to their source of fear (potential adventure). The sewer grates can be sealed (DC 13 Athletics) to stop the flood. City pays 20 gp for solving the rat problem.
