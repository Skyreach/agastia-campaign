# Street Performer

**Roll:** 3 on 2d10

A bard with an invisible servant and animated objects performs a one-man-band show in the square, gathering a crowd. He's talented and knows everything happening in the city.

**Variation:** He's a retired adventurer with useful magic items, or he's a spy for a thieves' guild.

**Non-Combat:** Tipping generously (5+ gp) or joining the performance earns friendship and information. He knows: where to fence goods, which guards are corrupt, gang territories, upcoming events, and juicy rumors. He might offer to join for an adventure or introduce the party to useful contacts.
