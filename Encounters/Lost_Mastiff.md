# Lost Mastiff

**Roll:** 3 on 2d8

A skeletal, starving mastiff watches the party from the undergrowth, too scared to approach. It wears a rotted leather collar with a noble family's crest. If offered food, it bonds with whoever feeds it first and becomes fiercely loyal.

**Variation:** The dog is being tracked by a bugbear who wants to eat it—”the bugbear arrives in 1d4 rounds after the party encounters the dog.

**Non-Combat:** Following the collar's crest leads to a ruined estate where the dog's original owners were killed by bandits; treasure remains hidden in the wreckage.
