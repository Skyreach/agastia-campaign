# Cursed Statue

**Roll:** 6 on 2d6

A barnacle-covered statue of a frog dominates a small island. Rubies glint in its eyes (each worth 20 gp), but it radiates faint magic. Disturbing it triggers a curse.

**Variation:** The statue is actually a petrified frog god who will bless those who clean and honor it, or the rubies are fake and removing them alerts nearby bullywugs.

**Non-Combat:** DC 13 Arcana reveals the curse nature. Proper religious ceremony (DC 12 Religion) allows safe ruby removal. Ignoring the statue means no risk. Taking rubies without ceremony curses the thief (disadvantage on all saves until *remove curse*).
