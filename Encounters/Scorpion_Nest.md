# Scorpion Nest

**Roll:** 8 on 2d8

Dozens of regular scorpions swarm from beneath a rocky outcrop—”their mother, a giant scorpion, emerges protectively. The rocks offer the only shade for miles.

**Variation:** Multiple giant scorpions nest here, or the scorpions are diseased (Con saves against poison are at disadvantage).

**Non-Combat:** Smoking them out or creating a distraction (tossed meat, fire) clears the nest. The outcrop contains a small cave with blessed water that cures disease (3 uses).
