# Basilisk Territory

**Roll:** 14 on 2d10

Unusually realistic stone statues line the path—”adventurers, merchants, even animals, all frozen in terror. A basilisk lurks nearby, its petrifying gaze a constant threat.

**Variation:** Multiple basilisks nest here, or a medusa controls the basilisk as a guardian.

**Non-Combat:** Navigating with eyes averted (DC 15 group check) or using mirrors to watch for the basilisk avoids the gaze. One statue can be restored with *lesser restoration* or similar magic—”a grateful survivor who provides information.
