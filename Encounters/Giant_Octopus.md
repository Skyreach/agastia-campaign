# Giant Octopus

**Roll:** 12 on 2d8

Tentacles burst from the water, wrapping around anything grabbable. A giant octopus hunts near a partially sunken tower that it's claimed as a lair.

**Variation:** The octopus is intelligent (trained by merfolk or sahuagin), or it guards the tower's submerged entrance to a dungeon.

**Non-Combat:** Ink clouds (the octopus flees when seriously hurt) provide escape. Offering fish (10 days rations) distracts it. The tower might contain air pockets with treasure or be a dungeon entrance requiring water breathing to explore.
