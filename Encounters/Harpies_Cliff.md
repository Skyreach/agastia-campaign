# Harpies' Cliff

**Roll:** 13 on 2d8

Haunting songs echo from rocky seaside cliffs. Harpies nest in the heights, their luring melodies compelling creatures to climb and fall to their deaths (DC 11 Wisdom save vs. charm).

**Variation:** A harpy matriarch (add 10 HP) leads the flock, or they guard valuable treasure in their aerie.

**Non-Combat:** Deafening the party (wax in ears, *silence*) negates the song. Climbing to their nest while they hunt (they have hunting patterns) allows looting without confrontation (4d20 gp in treasures from victims). Showing immunity to their song (successful saves) sometimes makes them flee—”they rely on the song.
