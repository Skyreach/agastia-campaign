# Mummy Guardian

**Roll:** 12 on 2d8

A mummy emerges from beneath the sand near a half-buried tomb entrance, ancient wrappings fluttering. It attacks intruders to its master's rest—”unless properly placated.

**Variation:** Multiple mummies guard a greater tomb, or the mummy can speak and demands an offering to pass.

**Non-Combat:** Showing proper respect (religious rites, offering treasures to the tomb, DC 13 Religion check) satisfies its purpose. The tomb interior holds treasure but also additional undead (or curses).
