# Manticore Lair

**Roll:** 16 on 2d8

A rocky promontory overlooking the sea serves as a manticore's hunting perch. It watches for prey, its tail spikes ready. The beast is intelligent and speaks Common, preferring to negotiate from a position of strength.

**Variation:** A mated pair hunts together, or it's been wounded and desperate.

**Non-Combat:** Manticores are lawful evil—”they keep deals. Negotiating passage (DC 14 Persuasion, offering food worth 20 gp or information about better hunting grounds) can work. It knows coastal geography intimately and might share for the right price. Its lair contains 3d20 gp from past victims.
