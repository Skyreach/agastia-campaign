# Frost Giant Sentry

**Roll:** 20 on 2d10

An enormous frost giant stands watch at a narrow pass, blocking the way forward. She's on duty, preventing "smallfolk" from discovering her clan's settlement beyond. She's bored and might be convinced to let the party pass—”or she might want entertainment.

**Variation:** She's accompanied by winter wolves as companions, or she's looking for slaves and tries to capture rather than kill.

**Non-Combat:** Entertaining her with stories, contests of strength, or tribute (valuable furs, gems worth 50+ gp) earns passage. She might even provide information about the path ahead if impressed. Warning: her clan lies ahead, and she'll describe them if asked.
