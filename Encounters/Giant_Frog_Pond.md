# Giant Frog Pond

**Roll:** 9 on 2d10

A murky pond blocks the path, its surface broken by enormous lily pads. Giant frogs lurk beneath, their tongues capable of snatching and swallowing creatures whole.

**Variation:** One frog is enormous (use giant toad stats, add 10 HP), or the pond contains a sunken chest (3d20 gp worth of trade goods).

**Non-Combat:** Circling the pond (adds 1 hour travel) avoids them. Throwing large amounts of meat as distraction allows crossing. The frogs are territorial, not aggressive—”leaving them alone lets everyone avoid conflict.
