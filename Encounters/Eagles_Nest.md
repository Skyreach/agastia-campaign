# Eagle's Nest

**Roll:** 6 on 2d10

A giant eagle circles a rocky spire where its nest sits, visible from the path. The eagle is protective but not immediately aggressive—”unless someone approaches the nest.

**Variation:** The nest contains a golden egg (actually a rare stone worth 75 gp) or wounded human caught by the eagle days ago.

**Non-Combat:** Leaving offerings of fresh meat allows safe passage. Helping a wounded eagle earns its temporary companionship as a scout for one day.
