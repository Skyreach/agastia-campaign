# Pseudodragon Quarrel

**Roll:** 5 on 2d8

Two pseudodragons are locked in an aerial squabble over a shiny object (a silver locket). They dive and snap at each other, occasionally crashing into trees. Neither wants to back down from this territorial dispute.

**Variation:** The locket is actually cursed—”whoever touches it becomes the next target of their conflict until it's returned to its resting place (an old grave nearby).

**Non-Combat:** The party can adjudicate the dispute; the grateful winner becomes a temporary companion for 1d4 days, or both pseudodragons flee, dropping the locket (worth 25 gp, or more if returned to rightful owner's family).
