# Giant Spider Infestation

**Roll:** 14 on 2d10

A warehouse district has been infested with giant wolf spiders that emerged from imported cargo. They've webbed several workers to walls and ceilings.

**Variation:** An ettercap commands them, or they're protecting egg sacs that will hatch soon.

**Non-Combat:** Smoking them out or using fire clears the infestation. The warehouse owner pays 50 gp for elimination. Rescued workers provide information about the cargo's origin. The webs can be harvested (DC 12 Nature, worth 3d20 gp to right buyers).
