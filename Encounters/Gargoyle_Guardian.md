# Gargoyle Guardian

**Roll:** 11 on 2d10

A stone gargoyle perches at a narrow pass, perfectly still. Ancient script at its base reads: "Only the worthy may pass." It animates when approached, demanding a toll or test.

**Variation:** Multiple gargoyles guard a forgotten temple entrance, or the gargoyle is corrupted and attacks mindlessly.

**Non-Combat:** Answering a riddle correctly, paying a toll (10 gp in gems placed in an offering bowl), or demonstrating bravery grants passage. The gargoyle's chamber contains clues to a nearby treasure.
