# Aarakocra Scouts

**Roll:** 3 on 2d10

Bird-like humanoids circle overhead, their keen eyes scanning the mountains. They descend to investigate strangers in their territory but are cautious rather than aggressive. They speak of "the dark thing in the eastern peaks" and can provide aerial reconnaissance.

**Variation:** They're refugees fleeing from a gargoyle infestation and need help reclaiming their nesting grounds.

**Non-Combat:** Offering gifts of shiny objects or helping with a simple task (retrieve a lost item blown by wind to a dangerous ledge) earns their friendship and valuable scouting information.
