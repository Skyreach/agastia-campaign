# Basilisk Den

**Roll:** 12 on 2d10

Stone statues of animals and humanoids litter a clearing—”all frozen mid-motion. A basilisk makes its lair here, using the statues as both warning and hunting blind.

**Variation:** Multiple basilisks nest together, or a medusa controls the basilisk and uses it as a guardian.

**Non-Combat:** Navigating blindfolded or with mirror vision (DC 15 group check) avoids the gaze. One statue might be recently petrified and restorable (*greater restoration* or similar). The basilisk's stomach contains 3d20 gp in swallowed valuables.
