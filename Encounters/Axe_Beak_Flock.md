# Axe Beak Flock

**Roll:** 11 on 2d10

Large, flightless birds with powerful beaks and talons charge from the undergrowth, protecting their nearby nesting grounds. They're territorial and aggressive.

**Variation:** The nest contains eggs worth 25 gp each to collectors (3 eggs), or a velociraptor pack has been hunting them, arriving shortly.

**Non-Combat:** Backing away slowly while making noise (DC 12 Animal Handling or Intimidation) satisfies their territorial display. The nest area can be marked on a map—”traders pay for exotic bird egg locations.
