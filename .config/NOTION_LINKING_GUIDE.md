## ðŸ”— Adding Manual Page-to-Page Links

### Step 1: Link Database Entries Together

**Goal:** Create bidirectional relationships between entities in the database.

#### Example: Manny â†’ Professor Zero â†’ The Codex

1. Open **Manny's database entry** in Notion
2. Find the "Related Entities" property
3. Click to add relation â†’ Search "Professor Zero" â†’ Select
4. Also add: Nikki, Nona, The Codex
5. Save

Now do the same for Professor Zero:
1. Open **Professor Zero's database entry**
2. Add to "Related Entities": All 10 Decimate subjects, The Codex
3. Save

The relation is **bidirectional** - adding Manny to Professor Zero's relations will automatically add Professor Zero to Manny's relations.

### Step 2: Link Locations with Parent-Child Hierarchy

#### Example: Agastia Region â†’ Agastia City â†’ Scholar Quarter

1. Open **Agastia City** database entry
2. Set "Parent Location" property â†’ Select "Agastia Region"
3. Save

4. Open **Scholar Quarter** database entry
5. Set "Parent Location" property â†’ Select "Agastia"
6. Save

7. Go back to **Agastia** database entry
8. Check "Child Locations" - should now show "Scholar Quarter" automatically (bidirectional)

### Step 3: Add Faction and Location Relations for NPCs

#### Example: Professor Zero â†’ Decimate Project â†’ Agastia

1. Open **Professor Zero** database entry
2. Set "Faction" property â†’ Select "Decimate Project"
3. Set "Location" property â†’ Select "Agastia" (or specific location like "Scholar Quarter")
4. Save

Do this for all NPCs:
- **Steel Dragon** â†’ Chaos Cult â†’ Unknown
- **The Patron** â†’ (to be determined) â†’ Agastia
- All Decimate NPCs â†’ Decimate Project â†’ Agastia

### Step 4: Link Artifacts to Seekers

#### Example: The Codex â†’ Professor Zero, Manny, Nikki

1. Open **The Codex** database entry
2. Find "Seekers" property
3. Add relations: Professor Zero, Manny, Nikki
4. Set "Current Location" â†’ Select a location entity
5. Save

Do the same for:
- **Giant's Axe** â†’ Seekers: Rakash, (anyone interested) â†’ Current Location: Ratterdan

---

### Step 5: Create Session â†’ Entity Links

#### Example: Session 1 â†’ Rakash, Ratterdan, Giant's Axe

1. Open **Session 1** database entry
2. Add to "Related Entities": Rakash, Ratterdan, Giant's Axe, The Patron, Kyle
3. Save

This creates quick navigation from sessions to relevant entities.

## ðŸš¨ Safety Reminder

- All linking is done **in the database properties**, not by editing page content
- These operations are **100% safe** - they only create relations, no deletions
- You can always undo relations by clicking the X next to a linked entity
- Bidirectional relations update both entries automatically

---

## ðŸ“– Next Step After Linking

Once all manual links are complete:
1. Return to Agastia Campaign landing page
2. Create the 8 linked database views using `/linked` command
3. Apply filters as specified in `.config/NOTION_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
4. Test navigation between pages via relations

## Need Help?

If any entities are missing from the database:
1. Run `.config/safe_resync_all.sh` to re-sync all entities
2. Check that markdown files have proper YAML frontmatter
3. Verify entities appear in database before linking
