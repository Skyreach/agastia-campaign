## Sync Strategy

### Local ‚Üí Notion
1. Parse markdown frontmatter for properties
2. Extract Player Summary from `## Description` or `## Overview` sections
3. Extract DM Notes from `## DM Notes` or `## Secrets` sections
4. Build location hierarchy from file path
5. Create bidirectional relations
6. Auto-increment version on changes (patch by default)

### Notion ‚Üí Local
- Generally one-way (local is source of truth)
- Can pull version numbers for tracking
- Can pull added relations/connections made in Notion

### Version Increment Rules
- **Major bump:** When Type or Name changes, or complete rewrite
- **Minor bump:** New sections added (new NPC relationship, new goal, etc.)
- **Patch bump:** Typo fixes, clarifications, minor edits
