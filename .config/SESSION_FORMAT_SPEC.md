# Session Document Format Specification

## üö® MANDATORY FORMAT RULES

All session planning documents MUST follow this structure for Notion compatibility.

---

## Document Structure

### 1. Frontmatter (YAML)
```yaml
---
name: Session X - Title
type: Session
session_number: X
status: Planning|Active|Completed
version: "X.Y.Z"
date: YYYY-MM-DD or TBD
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
---
```

### 2. Title & Metadata
```markdown
# Session X: Title - DM Guide

**Party:** Level X (Y PCs) | **Duration:** X-Y hours | **Type:** Description
```

### 3. Mermaid Flowchart (MUST BE FIRST)
```markdown
## Session Flowchart

**Mermaid code block with flowchart**
```

**Critical Rules:**
- Flowchart MUST appear before "Quick Reference" section
- Use ```mermaid code blocks (Notion renders these)
- Keep flowchart concise and readable
- Show major decision points and branches

---

### 4. Quick Reference Section
```markdown
## Quick Reference

**Toggle: Session Flow**
- Bullet list of major beats
- NO nested toggles inside this toggle

**Toggle: Key NPCs & Factions**
- Bullet list of NPCs/factions
- NO nested toggles inside this toggle

**Toggle: Important Items**
- Bullet list of items/artifacts
- NO nested toggles inside this toggle
```

---

### 5. Nodes Section (ALL UNDER H2)
```markdown
## Nodes

### Node 1: Name

[Content here following tiered DC format]

---

### Node 2: Name

[Content here following tiered DC format]

---

### Node 3: Name

[Content here following tiered DC format]
```

**Critical Rules:**
- "Nodes" is H2 (`##`)
- Each node is H3 (`###`) under the Nodes section
- Separator `---` between nodes
- NO separate H2 for each node

---

## Tiered DC Format for Descriptions

**ALL room/scene descriptions MUST use this format:**

```markdown
### 1: The Scene Name

| Opening description text here. Sets the scene with evocative details that everyone sees immediately.

DC X: Basic information that most PCs will discover

DC X+4: More detailed information with the above included

DC X+7: Deep insights with all above included

DC X+10: Hidden/secret information with all above included
```

**Example:**
```markdown
### 1: The Cloud Compass

| As you approach the crater, you see the massive bluish-silver axe embedded at the center - clearly sized for a storm giant. Around the weapon, a dark storm cloud swirls unnaturally, trapped in place.

DC 10: Sized for a Giant, made of bluish-silver metal. **Corruption Seed:** Dark energy pulsing through the weapon

DC 14: As above and: Reality warps visibly around the artifact. Leaves fall upward in pockets of fey energy. Time seems to flow irregularly.

DC 17: As above and: Draconic runes visible near base. If Draconic known: "storm... bond..." (full translation requires research)

DC 20: As above and: Hidden thieves' cant symbol - looks like the number 8
```

**DC Tier Guidelines:**
- **DC 10-12:** Basic observation, most PCs will get this
- **DC 14-15:** Moderate success, requires attention
- **DC 17-18:** High success, specialized knowledge
- **DC 20+:** Expert/secret information, rare discovery

**Skills indicated via context:**
- Architecture details ‚Üí Investigation
- Magic effects ‚Üí Arcana
- Nature/creatures ‚Üí Nature/Survival
- Hidden things ‚Üí Perception
- Traps/mechanisms ‚Üí Investigation/Thieves' Tools
- Social cues ‚Üí Insight

## Notion-Compatible Markdown

### ‚úÖ SUPPORTED (Use These)

**Headers:**
```markdown
# H1 Title
## H2 Section
### H3 Subsection
```

**Emphasis:**
```markdown
**Bold text** - for emphasis, keywords
*Italic text* - for whispers, thoughts
`Code/mechanics` - for game terms, DCs
```

**Lists:**
```markdown
- Unordered list item
  - Nested item (2 spaces)

1. Ordered list item
2. Second item
```

**Blockquotes:**
```markdown
> Quoted text for read-aloud descriptions
> Use pipe | for boxed text in tiered DC format
```

**Code Blocks:**
```markdown
```language
Code here
``` (closing backticks)
```

**Toggles (Notion-specific):**
```markdown
**Toggle: Title**
Content that will be collapsible in Notion
More content
```

### ‚ùå NOT SUPPORTED (Never Use)

**HTML Tags:**
```html
<details><summary>Title</summary>Content</details>  <!-- NEVER USE -->
<div>Content</div>  <!-- NEVER USE -->
<br />  <!-- NEVER USE -->
```

**Horizontal Rules in Notion:**
```markdown
---  <!-- Use only as separator between nodes, NOT for visual breaks -->
```

**Tables:** (Notion tables work differently, avoid in session docs)

**Images:** (Requires special upload API)

---

## Section-Specific Formatting

### Dungeon Rooms (SYWABAGM Format)

```markdown
### AREA X: Room Name

**Boxed Text:**
> Description of what PCs immediately see

**Reactive Skill Checks:**
- **Perception DC X:** Information revealed
- **Arcana DC X:** Information revealed

**Room Elements:**

**Element Name:** Description and mechanics

**Element Name:** Description and mechanics

**Encounter:**
- Creatures, stats, tactics
```

### Skill Challenges

```markdown
### Node X: Challenge Name

| Description of the challenge

**Goal:** What success achieves

**Structure:** X successes before Y failures

**DC:** Base difficulty (adjust per skill)

**Possible Skills:**
- **Skill Name:** How it's used, what it reveals
- **Skill Name:** How it's used, what it reveals

**Success:** Outcome if they win

**Failure:** Outcome if they lose (still progress, but complications)
```

### Cutscenes

```markdown
### Cutscene: Event Name

**When triggered:**

1. **First Beat:**
   > Read-aloud description

2. **Second Beat:**
   > Read-aloud description
   >
   > **[To specific PC]:** Personal moment

3. **Resolution:**
   > Outcome description

**DM Notes:**
- Mechanical effects
- Player choices preserved
```

---

## Toggle Usage Rules

### Quick Reference Toggles
```markdown
**Toggle: Section Name**
- Content here
- More content
- NO nested toggles
```

### Node Content Toggles
```markdown
**Toggle: Detailed Stats**
Full stat block here

**Toggle: DM Notes**
Secret information here

**Toggle: Alternate Outcomes**
If players do X, then Y
```

**Critical:** Never nest toggles more than one level deep. Notion doesn't handle this well.

## Formatting Anti-Patterns

### ‚ùå Wrong: HTML Details Tags
```markdown
<details>
<summary><b>Room Description</b></summary>
Content here
</details>
```

### ‚úÖ Right: Notion Toggles
```markdown
**Toggle: Room Description**
Content here
```

---

### ‚ùå Wrong: Separate H2 Per Node
```markdown
## Node 1: Cloud Compass
[content]

## Node 2: Underground Dungeon
[content]
```

### ‚úÖ Right: Nodes Under Single H2
```markdown
## Nodes

### Node 1: Cloud Compass
[content]

---

### Node 2: Underground Dungeon
[content]
```

---

### ‚ùå Wrong: Boxed Text Without Tiers
```markdown
> You see an axe. It's big and magical.
```

### ‚úÖ Right: Tiered DC Format
```markdown
| You see a massive axe embedded in the crater.

DC 10: Storm giant-sized, bluish-silver metal

DC 14: As above and: Corruption pulses through it, reality warps nearby
```

- [ ] Nodes separated by `---`
- [ ] Descriptions use tiered DC format (pipe | for opening, DC tiers below)
- [ ] NO HTML tags anywhere in document
- [ ] Toggles formatted as `**Toggle: Title**` on own line
- [ ] Code blocks use triple backticks with language
- [ ] All emphasis uses markdown (**bold**, *italic*, `code`)

## MCP Integration

When `plan_session` or `generate_quest` tools create session files:

1. **Generate structure** following this spec exactly
2. **Use tiered DC format** for all scene descriptions
3. **Place Mermaid at top** before Quick Reference
4. **Nest nodes under H2** "Nodes" section
5. **NO HTML** - use Notion toggles instead
