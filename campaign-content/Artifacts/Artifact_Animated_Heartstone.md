# [[Animated Heartstone]]

## Player Summary

The **Animated Heartstone** is a powerful fey artifact discovered in the shadow-corrupted dungeon beneath [[Ratterdan]] during Session 1. When the party retrieved it, the crystalline heart burst with purple light, granting each party member a permanent feat based on their deepest desires. The artifact then transformed into an animated form and went dormant, though its nature and future potential remain mysterious.

The Heartstone broke the corruption afflicting the **Giant's Axe**, allowing [[Ian/Rakash]] to claim the weapon. An evil, echoing laugh accompanied its activation — suggesting an unknown mastermind behind its placement (later revealed to be [[Octavia (Subject #8)]], Subject #8 of the [[Decimate Project]]).

**Critical Warning:** If the Heartstone is destroyed, the party will LOSE the feats it granted.

- Connection permanent until destruction

**Option 4: Fey Gift**
- Genuine gift from fey entity
- No strings attached (rare for fey)
- Evil laugh was Octavia, not the artifact
- Simply powerful magical item

### Mystery Elements

**Unanswered Questions:**
1. What shape did the Heartstone take when animated?
2. Did the Heartstone stay animated or go dormant?
3. Did the party take it with them?
4. What was Octavia's true purpose?
5. Is there a fey entity connected to it?
6. Can it grant more power or is it depleted?
7. Does destroying it affect the Giant's Axe?

**For DM to Determine:**
- Heartstone's current form and status
- Whether it can be "recharged"
- Octavia's larger plan
- Fey connections and consequences
- How to integrate into future sessions

### Session 1 Decisions Needed

**DM Questions to Answer:**
- What shape did Heartstone take when animated? (Crystalline creature? Fey companion? Abstract form?)
- Did Heartstone go dormant or stay animated?
- Did party take Heartstone with them? (Inventory check)
- How did each PC react to their feat vision?
- Any immediate character development moments?

### Integration with Campaign

**[[Decimate Project]] Connection:**
- Octavia's involvement ties to main plot
- Party unknowingly part of experiment
- Other subjects may reference "the gift"
- [[Professor Zero]] may inquire about it

**Power Balance:**
- Feats are significant power boost
- Justified by artifact dependency
- Creates tension if Heartstone threatened
- Party must protect it to keep power

**Plot Device Potential:**
- Hostage situation (villain threatens Heartstone)
- Fey bargain revelation (debt must be paid)
- Recharge quest (empower it further)
- Sacrifice dilemma (destroy for greater good?)
