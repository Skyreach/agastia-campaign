# Giant's Axe

## Player Summary

The **Giant's Axe** is a massive, fey-crafted weapon discovered embedded in the ruins of [[Ratterdan]] during Session 1. Initially too large and cursed with shadow corruption to wield, the axe was cleansed when the [[Animated Heartstone]] released a tremendous pulse of purifying energy. After the curse broke, [[Ian/Rakash]] felt a powerful compulsion to claim the weapon, and it transformed to become wieldable.

The axe bears mysterious **Zhaask symbols** — draconic writing that suggests ancient giant and dragon connections. Its fey magic signature matches that of the [[Animated Heartstone]], hinting at a shared origin or purpose.
