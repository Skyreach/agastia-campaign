# Mistfall Shaman's Journal

**Physical Description:** A weathered leather journal bound with dried sinew, its cover stained with phosphorescent fungal residue. The pages are a mix of vellum and pressed cave-moss paper, written primarily in Common with occasional Undercommon marginalia. Many pages are water-damaged; some entries are illegible. The handwriting deteriorates noticeably in later entries.

## Journal Entries

### 12th of Ches, 1182 DR

The elders say I must record what I learn if I am to become a keeper of memory. So I write.

Before the waters called to us, we lived in the upper caves where the moss grows thick and the air tastes of stone. We followed the blind fish through the rivers. We traded with the svirfneblin when they would speak to us. We were wanderers.

Then grandmother Thessaly heard the singing. She followed it down, down, down. She found the falls. She drank.

She lived for two hundred years after. But she never left.

---

### 3rd of Mirtul, 1184 DR

Elder Kethrin says my gift is with the crawling things. The centipedes do not bite me. The spiders let me pass. Today a cave fisher followed me home like a lost pup. I have named her Whisper.

The others think it strange. I think they are jealous.

---

### 19th of Eleint, 1189 DR

Another surface-dweller found the falls today. A dwarf in rusted mail, mad with thirst. He pushed past the scouts, past the warnings carved in stone. He drank and drank and drank.

We pulled his body from the pool at sunset. His hands were still reaching for the water.

Elder Kethrin says we must be more vigilant. The waters heal all wounds except the ones they create.

---

### 7th of Uktar, 1191 DR

Three more this season. A human woman clutching a holy symbol. Two half-elves who might have been siblings. All the same in the end—bones joining the others at the bottom of the pool.

I do not understand surface-dwellers. Can they not see the bones? Can they not smell the danger beneath the sweetness?

Whisper caught a fish for me today. She is a good friend.

---

### 2nd of Tarsakh, 1195 DR

Something strange. The body we pulled from the pool today—an elf, old even by their reckoning—carried something that did not belong in the water.

A book. Bound in leather so pale it seems to glow. The pages should be ruined, but they are dry. The ink should have run, but the symbols are sharp as the day they were written. When I look at them too long, they seem to move. To breathe.

Elder Kethrin took it immediately. She says we must study it. She says it feels *important*.

I do not like how she looks at it.

---

### 28th of Flamerule, 1195 DR

The book has no title. The symbols are in no language any of us recognize—not Common, not Undercommon, not Elvish or Dwarvish or the old runes of the deep gnomes. Yet somehow, when you stare long enough, meaning begins to form. Like shapes in smoke.

Kethrin calls it "The Pale Record." Others call it "The Book That Waits."

I call it nothing. I do not speak of it.

---

### 14th of Hammer, 1196 DR

A trespasser reached the falls today. But he did not drink.

He stood at the edge of the pool for a long time, staring at the water. His hands shook. His lips were cracked with thirst. But he turned away.

The scouts were so surprised they let him see them. He raised his hands—empty, peaceful. He said his name was Garrek. He said he was looking for something, but not this.

Elder Kethrin invited him to speak with us. This has never happened before.

---

### 9th of Ches, 1196 DR

Garrek stays. He does not drink the water—not even the safe water we collect from the upper streams. He brought his own supplies.

He is interested in the book. He says he has seen symbols like these before, in ruins on the surface. He says they are very old. Older than elves. Older than dragons, perhaps.

I do not trust him. But Whisper does, and she is rarely wrong about people.

---

### 22nd of Eleasis, 1197 DR

Garrek and Elder Kethrin spend every day with the book now. They argue. They draw diagrams. They burn incense that makes my eyes water.

Today Garrek said he thinks he understands part of it. He says the book describes *boundaries*. Not walls—something deeper. Agreements written into the fabric of things. He says whoever made this book knew how to draw lines that could not be crossed.

Kethrin's eyes went very bright when he said that.

---

### 5th of Marpenoth, 1198 DR

They have done it. Kethrin and Garrek. They used the book.

There is a barrier now around the inner falls. You cannot see it, but you can feel it—like walking into a warm wind that does not move. The desperate ones, the addicted ones, they cannot pass. They reach the threshold and simply... stop. As if they have forgotten why they came.

No more drownings. For the first time in my memory, no more drownings.

Garrek wept when it worked. I did not know surface-dwellers could care so much about people they had never met.

---

### 11th of Kythorn, 1199 DR

Garrek comes and goes now. He says he has responsibilities on the surface, but he always returns. Each time he brings gifts.

Last month: bolts of fabric dyed in colors I have never seen. Blues like the sky he describes. Greens like surface leaves.

This month: tools of strange metal that do not rust. A set of small jars that refill themselves with spices when you shake them—pepper and salt and something called "saffron" that tastes like sunshine must taste.

The children follow him everywhere now. Even I have grown fond of him.

---

### 3rd of Eleint, 1201 DR

A friend of Garrek's visited today. A woman with sharp eyes and a smile that does not reach them. She said her name, but I have already forgotten it. Something about her makes names slip away.

She was very interested in the barrier. She asked many questions. How far does it extend? What exactly does it stop? Could it be made larger? Smaller? Could it be moved?

Garrek seemed uncomfortable with her questions. He changed the subject to the spice jars. She laughed, but her eyes did not.

---

### 17th of Tarsakh, 1203 DR

I have found a new friend. A giant spider, bigger than Whisper, with markings like stars on her back. I call her Nighteye. She and Whisper circle each other warily, but I think they will learn to share.

The elder's apprentice says I have a gift. Perhaps I will be a keeper of beasts instead of a keeper of memory.

I would prefer that. Beasts are simpler than history.

---

### 8th of Uktar, 1205 DR

Garrek's friend returned without him today. She wanted to see the book.

Kethrin refused. The friend smiled—that same smile that does not reach her eyes—and said she understood completely.

I watched her from the shadows as she left. She did not go toward the surface tunnels. She went deeper. Toward the pool.

I told Kethrin. She said I was imagining things.

---

### 29th of Alturiak, 1207 DR

The friend has been visiting more often. Always with questions. Always with that smile.

Today she asked if the barrier could keep something *in* as well as *out*.

Garrek argued with her afterward. I could not hear the words, but I heard the tone. Sharp. Frightened.

She left. Garrek stayed. He has not left the settlement in three months.

---

### 14th of Mirtul, 1208 DR

Arguments. Always arguments now.

The friend wants to use the book for something. Garrek says it is too dangerous. Kethrin is caught between them—she sees the power in the book, but she trusts Garrek's fear.

I stay with my creatures. They do not argue. They do not want things they should not have.

---

### 6th of Eleint, 1208 DR

Garrek is gone.

He left in the night without saying goodbye. His things are still in his chamber. His notes, his drawings, his half-finished map of the upper tunnels.

Kethrin sent scouts to find him. They found nothing.

The friend came by today. She seemed unsurprised.

---

### 23rd of Marpenoth, 1208 DR

We found him.

Six weeks he has been missing. Six weeks we searched the tunnels, the caverns, the places where the lost go to die.

He was in the pool. Floating face-down in the sacred waters. His body preserved perfectly—the waters do that, keep the dead fresh as the living.

But the waters can only heal those dead less than three days.

Garrek has been dead for weeks. We could see it in his eyes when we turned him over. The waters kept his flesh, but they could not keep his soul.

Someone held him under. Someone made sure he could not be saved.

The friend has not returned.

---

### 1st of Nightal, 1208 DR

Kethrin has made a decision.

We will use the book one final time. We will seal ourselves away. The barrier that kept the desperate out will now keep everyone out. And everyone in.

No more surface-dwellers. No more friends who smile with cold eyes. No more Garreks dying in our waters.

I understand. But I will miss the colors of fabric. I will miss the spices.

I will miss the idea that the surface could produce someone like Garrek.

---

### 18th of Ches, 1209 DR

It is done. The barrier surrounds our entire territory now.

Kethrin and the crafters have made a device—a small thing, like a compass made of crystal and bone. It lets the bearer pass through the barrier as if it were not there.

There are only three. One for Kethrin. One for the scouts. One kept in the vault.

We are safe now. We are alone.

I am not sure those are different things.

---

### 7th of Flamerule, 1212 DR

I have volunteered for the outer watch.

Someone must guard the passages beyond the barrier. Someone must turn away those who come seeking the waters before they reach the threshold and forget themselves.

I will take my friends—Whisper, Nighteye, the others I have gathered. We will be the first warning. The gentle hand that guides travelers away before the barrier can trap them in confusion.

Kethrin has given me one of the devices. She says I can return whenever I wish.

I do not think I will wish to return often. The settlement feels smaller now.

---

### 12th of Eleasis, 1215 DR

I have lost the device.

Somewhere between the fungal grove and the crystal choke point, it slipped from my pack. I have retraced my steps a hundred times. I have sent Whisper and Nighteye to search. Nothing.

It must be near the pool. I was there three days ago, checking on a family of cave fishers. It must have fallen then.

I cannot reach the pool. The barrier stops me now, just like it stops everyone else.

I will keep searching.

---

### 3rd of Tarsakh, 1218 DR

Three years. Still no device.

I have made new friends in my searching. A rust monster who follows me like a loyal hound. A pair of hook horrors who nest near the phosphor moss. They are good company.

But I am beginning to forget the faces of my tribe. When I try to picture Kethrin, I see only a blur of red hair. When I try to remember my mother's voice, I hear only the sound of falling water.

The barrier does something to memory, I think. The longer you are away, the harder it is to remember what you are away from.

---

### 19th of Uktar, 1223 DR

I know the device is by the pool. It must be. There is nowhere else it could be.

But I cannot reach the pool. And no one comes to relieve me. Has Kethrin forgotten I am here? Have they all forgotten?

I shout at the barrier sometimes. I beat my fists against the nothing until they bleed.

The barrier does not care.

Whisper died last year. Old age, I think. I buried her near the singing crystals.

I do not want to die out here alone.

---

### 8th of Ches, 1231 DR

I have been experimenting.

The waters of the falls have power. The crystals that grow here have power. My blood—the blood of one who has lived near the sacred pool for generations—has power.

If I cannot find the device, perhaps I can make a new one.

I mixed the waters with my blood and poured it over a crystal formation. The crystal turned red. It pulsed with light.

It did not let me through the barrier.

But when I held it near Nighteye's children, they stopped. They listened. They *obeyed*.

This is not what I wanted. But it is something.

---

### 14th of Eleint, 1238 DR

My network grows. Red crystals scattered through the tunnels. Creatures bound to my will. Hook horrors and darkmantles and things that crawl in the deep places.

I tell myself I am still guarding. I am turning away the desperate ones, the seekers, the would-be drowners.

But sometimes I forget why. Sometimes I see a traveler and I think only: *they might have a device. They might have a way through.*

And then my friends bring them to me. And I ask them questions. And when they have no answers, I...

I do not like to think about what happens then.

---

### 2nd of Mirtul, 1244 DR

I know I am close to home. I can smell it sometimes—the lavender and honey sweetness of the falls. I can hear the water singing.

But I cannot find the way. The tunnels twist. The paths I remember lead nowhere. The barrier is everywhere and nowhere.

I have forgotten my mother's name. I have forgotten my own name, some days.

I remember Garrek. I remember his kindness. I remember the spice jars that tasted like sunshine.

I remember the friend with the cold smile.

I remember Kethrin saying there was a test. That those who sought the falls must prove themselves worthy. Strength and wisdom, she said. Mercy where cruelty would be easier.

Is that what I must do? Pass a test?

What is the test?

---

### 27th of Marpenoth, 1247 DR

test

the test is

I must

I cannot remember what I must do. The crystals sing to me. My friends wait for my commands. Travelers come and I take them and I ask them and they do not know

they do not know

no one knows

the test

pass the test

return home

what is the test

what

is
