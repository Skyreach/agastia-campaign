# Kuo-toa Scouts

**Roll:** 9 on 2d8

Fish-like humanoids with bulging eyes watch from tide pools, whispering in their strange language. They're insane and unpredictable but not immediately aggressive.

**Variation:** They believe one party member is their god incarnate (DC 13 Persuasion to play along), or they're fleeing from their deeper settlement's coup.

**Non-Combat:** Showing "divine" power (any magic) convinces them to worship temporarily. They'll provide information about underwater caves, sea creatures, or their settlement's layout. Playing along gains weird offerings (worthless to surface dwellers but 2d20 gp if sold to collectors).
