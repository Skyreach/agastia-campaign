# Friendly Merfolk

**Roll:** 2 on 2d8

Beautiful aquatic humanoids surface near the party, curiosity in their eyes. They're peaceful traders who exchange sea treasures for surface goods and warn about dangerous waters ahead.

**Variation:** One merfolk is a noble seeking help against sahuagin raiders, or they're fleeing from a sea hag.

**Non-Combat:** Trading goods (they love wine, worked metal, surface fruits) earns friendship, maps of safe waters, warnings about reefs/predators, and potentially a conch shell that can summon them once for aid. They can also retrieve sunken objects or scout underwater areas.
