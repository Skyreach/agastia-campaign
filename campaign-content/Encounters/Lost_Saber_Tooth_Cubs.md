# Lost Saber-Tooth Cubs

**Roll:** 3 on 2d6

Two adorable (but dangerous) saber-toothed tiger cubs play in the snow, pouncing on each other and mewling. They're separated from their mother, who is definitely looking for them nearby.

**Variation:** The mother arrives in 1d4+1 rounds, enraged and protective (use saber-toothed tiger stats).

**Non-Combat:** Calming the cubs (DC 14 Animal Handling) and leading them to fresh tracks reunites them with mother; she watches the party leave but doesn't attack, remembering the kindness.
