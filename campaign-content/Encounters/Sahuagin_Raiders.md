# Sahuagin Raiders

**Roll:** 10 on 2d8

Shark-men emerge from the surf, tridents ready and sharks circling nearby. They're raiding for slaves and treasure, attacking surface settlements.

**Variation:** A sahuagin baron leads them (much tougher), or they're escorting a captured mer-noble.

**Non-Combat:** Showing strength and fighting ability (DC 14 Intimidation, display of power) might make them respect the party too much to attack—”they prefer easy prey. Freeing captives earns gratitude and potential allies. The sahuagin carry 3d20 gp in looted treasure.
