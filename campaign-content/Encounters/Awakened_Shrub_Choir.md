# Awakened Shrub Choir

**Roll:** 4 on 2d8

The party stumbles into a clearing where awakened shrubs sway and sing in terrible, off-key harmony. They're practicing for the Seasonal Celebration and desperately want an audience. The shrubs are harmless but incredibly annoying.

**Variation:** One shrub is actually a twig blight spy sent by a gulthias tree—”it tries to lead the party into a trap.

**Non-Combat:** If the party gives honest (even critical) feedback and helps them practice, the shrubs share knowledge of a nearby hidden spring that grants temporary hit points when drunk (1d8+1 temp HP, lasts until next rest).
