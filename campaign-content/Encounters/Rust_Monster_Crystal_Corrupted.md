# Rust Monster (Crystal-Corrupted)

**Roll:** 10 on 2d6 (Underdark Crystal Encounters)

A bizarre creature scuttles toward you on four legs, its insectoid body covered in chitinous plates. Two long, feathery antennae twitch excitedly as it sniffs the air near your metal equipment. Red crystal shards are embedded in its carapace, pulsing with an eerie glow. The creature appears drawn to both metal and the nearby crystal formations.

## Encounter Details

**Creature:** 1 Rust Monster (CR 1/2)
**Theme:** Crystal-Corrupted
**Challenge:** Tactical encounter (dangerous for armored PCs)

**Setup:**
- Feeding near red crystal formation, absorbing crystal energy
- Attracted to metal equipment (especially armor and weapons)
- Not inherently hostile but territorial and hungry

## Stat Block - Rust Monster (Standard)

**AC:** 14 (natural armor)
**HP:** 27 (5d8 + 5)
**Speed:** 40 ft.

**STR** 13 (+1) | **DEX** 12 (+1) | **CON** 13 (+1) | **INT** 2 (-4) | **WIS** 13 (+1) | **CHA** 6 (-2)

**Senses:** Darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 11
**Languages:** —
**CR:** 1/2 (100 XP)

### Special Abilities

**Iron Scent:** The rust monster can pinpoint, by scent, the location of ferrous metal within 30 feet of it.

**Rust Metal:** Any nonmagical weapon made of metal that hits the rust monster corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to −5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal that hits the rust monster is destroyed after dealing damage.

### Actions

**Bite:** +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d8 + 1) piercing damage.

**Antennae:** The rust monster corrodes a nonmagical ferrous metal object it can see within 5 feet of it. If the object isn't being worn or carried, the touch destroys a 1-foot cube of it. If the object is being worn or carried by a creature, the creature can make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw to avoid the rust monster's touch.

If the object touched is either metal armor or a metal shield being worn or carried, it takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to the AC it offers. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 or a shield that drops to a +0 bonus is destroyed. If the object touched is a held metal weapon, it rusts as described in the Rust Metal trait.

## Crystal-Corrupted Modifications

**Visual Changes:**
- Red crystal shards embedded in carapace and antennae
- Eyes glow with faint red light
- Larger than normal rust monster (size of a large dog)
- Leaves trail of metallic dust mixed with crystal fragments

**Behavioral Changes:**
- Attracted to both metal AND red crystal energy
- More aggressive than typical rust monster
- Will defend nearby crystal formation if threatened
- Drawn to magic items (not just metal)

**Optional Mechanic (DM Choice):**
If you want to make it more challenging, add:
**Crystal Hunger:** Once per encounter, can target a magical metal item. Owner makes DC 13 Dexterity save (instead of DC 11). On failure, magic item takes −1 penalty (recovers after *mending* or similar).

## Tactics

**Initial Behavior:**
1. Sniffs air excitedly when detecting metal
2. Scuttles toward party (not attacking, just investigating)
3. Tries to touch/taste metal equipment with antennae
4. Becomes aggressive only if attacked or driven from crystal formation

**Combat Approach:**
- Targets heaviest armored character first (most metal to eat)
- Uses Antennae on shields, armor, then weapons (prioritizes biggest metal sources)
- Bite attacks secondary (only when antennae used or out of range)
- Retreats if seriously wounded (below 10 HP) to crystal formation

**Territorial Defense:**
- If party attacks nearby crystal formation, rust monster becomes hostile
- Positions between party and crystals
- Will not pursue beyond 60 feet of crystal formation

## Non-Combat Solutions

**Distraction with Metal:**
- Offer metal object (rations, pitons, crowbar, etc.)
- Rust monster happily consumes it (1d4 rounds)
- Party can sneak past or take alternate route
- Cost: 5-50 gp depending on item sacrificed

**Lure Away from Crystals:**
- Drop metal object 30+ feet away
- DC 12 Animal Handling or Survival check
- Success: Rust monster follows, party passes safely
- Failure: Rust monster suspicious, doesn't take bait

**Avoid Detection:**
- Party without metal equipment can pass safely (DC 10 Stealth)
- Characters with metal: DC 15 Stealth group check
- Failure: Rust monster detects and investigates (not hostile unless threatened)

**Intimidation:**
- DC 13 Intimidation check (show fire, loud noises, aggressive posturing)
- Success: Rust monster backs off, allowing passage
- Failure: Rust monster becomes aggressive

## Rewards

**Loot:**
- Crystal shards embedded in corpse (1d4 pieces, 5 gp each)
- Metallic residue in stomach (dissolved armor/weapons, 2d10 gp worth of salvageable metal)
- Intact antennae (arcane component, 20 gp, useful for *detect magic* spell components)

**Experience:**
- 100 XP if defeated in combat
- 100 XP if successfully lured away/avoided
- 50 XP if party sacrifices metal to distract it (partial solution)

**Mistfallen Observation:**
- Darva notes if party solved encounter cleverly (luring, intimidation, sacrifice)
- Killing rust monster when avoidable = negative mark (unnecessary violence)
- Using non-lethal solution = positive mark (shows wisdom and restraint)

## DM Notes

**Danger to Party:**
- **Armored Characters:** Extreme danger (AC reduction is devastating)
- **Unarmored Characters:** Minimal danger (just bite attacks)
- **Weapon Users:** Moderate danger (weapon degradation is expensive)

**Tactics for Players:**
- Non-metal weapons (clubs, quarterstaffs) are safe
- Magic items *might* be targeted (DM discretion on Crystal Hunger)
- Ranged attacks from 30+ feet avoid antennae
- Sacrificing cheap metal (10 pitons = 5 sp) is cost-effective solution

**Difficulty Adjustment:**
- **Too Easy:** Add second rust monster or make it faster (50 ft. speed)
- **Too Hard:** Remove Crystal Hunger ability, reduce HP to 20
- **Party has no metal:** Change to different encounter (roll again or use Violet Fungi)

**Placement:**
- Near red crystal formation in wide chamber (room to maneuver)
- Skeletal remains nearby showing previous victims (rusted armor/weapons)
- Evidence of crystal corruption (metallic dust mixed with crystal fragments on floor)

**Flavor Description:**
- Chittering, clicking sounds from mandibles
- Antennae twitch and wave excitedly near metal
- Scuttles sideways like a crab when circling
- When eating metal: satisfied purring/humming sound
- Crystal shards glow brighter when it feeds

**Connection to Lore:**
- Example of how red crystals corrupt Underdark creatures
- Not mind-controlled like others, but mutated/attracted to crystal energy
- Shows crystals' influence beyond just mind control
- Foreshadows what prolonged crystal exposure does to living things

## Environmental Details

**Crystal Formation Nearby:**
- Large red crystal cluster (3-5 feet tall)
- Pulsing with dim light
- Rust monster feeds here, absorbing energy
- If destroyed: Rust monster becomes confused and agitated (disadvantage on attacks for 1 minute)

**Evidence of Feeding:**
- Piles of rust and metal debris around crystal
- Dissolved armor pieces (helmets, gauntlets)
- Corroded weapons embedded in ground
- Tells story: This creature has been here a while, many victims

**Tracks:**
- Rust monster tracks lead to/from crystal formation
- DC 12 Survival: Tracks show it patrols this area regularly
- DC 15 Survival: Multiple rust monsters use this territory (might encounter more)
