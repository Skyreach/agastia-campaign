# Awakened Tree Guardian

**Roll:** 4 on 2d10

An ancient tree suddenly opens eyes of amber sap and speaks in a deep, creaking voice. It's awakened, watching over this section of jungle, and wants to know the party's intentions.

**Variation:** Multiple awakened trees form a grove council, or the tree is dying and seeks help against a corruption spreading through the jungle.

**Non-Combat:** Respectful conversation and promises not to harm the jungle earn passage and information. The tree can point toward water sources, warn about territorial creatures, or share ancient lore. It might gift a branch that can be used as a club or staff.
