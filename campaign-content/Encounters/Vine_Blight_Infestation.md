# Vine Blight Infestation

**Roll:** 17 on 2d10

Vines writhe with unnatural life, strangling trees and blocking paths. Vine blights emerge from the corruption, attacking silently. At the center grows something dark—”a young gulthias tree or corrupted shrine.

**Variation:** A green hag planted the corruption, or the blights serve a treant driven mad by disease.

**Non-Combat:** Fire clears paths through blights (they're vulnerable). Finding and destroying the corruption source (DC 14 Nature to identify, then appropriate magic or holy water) ends the threat without fighting every blight. The area might hold buried treasure from previous victims.
