# Stirge Storm

**Roll:** 11 on 2d8

A high-pitched buzzing fills the air as a thirst of stirges drops from the canopy like a crimson cloud. They're ravenous, having fed on a dying deer nearby. Blood frenzy makes them fearless.

**Variation:** So many stirges descend that they count as two swarms instead of individual creatures; or they're fleeing from something even worse (a young green dragon arrives in 1d6 rounds).

**Non-Combat:** Characters who immediately drop prone and cover themselves can avoid the initial assault (DC 13 Dex save); smoke or fire drives them off without a fight.
