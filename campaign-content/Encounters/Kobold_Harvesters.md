# Kobold Harvesters

**Roll:** 13 on 2d10

Small, scaly figures pick through giant lizard droppings, collecting shiny objects and scales. The kobolds are more cowardly than aggressive and flee when confronted.

**Variation:** They serve a green dragon wyrmling and carry treasure to it, or they've set elaborate traps throughout the area.

**Non-Combat:** Intimidation (DC 12) scares them off immediately. Following them leads to either their lair (small treasures, traps) or their dragon master's location. They'll trade information for food or shiny objects.
