# Peryton Hunt

**Roll:** 13 on 2d10

A shadow passes overhead—”a peryton circles, its stag-headed silhouette ominous against the sky. It's hunting for humanoid hearts, which it needs to reproduce.

**Variation:** A mated pair hunts together, coordinating attacks, or the peryton is wounded and desperate.

**Non-Combat:** Taking cover in a rocky overhang or cave makes aerial attacks impossible; the peryton eventually gives up for easier prey. Its shadow always matches a humanoid, unnerving those who notice (DC 12 Insight).
