# Con Artist

**Roll:** 9 on 2d10

A charming man runs a barrel-lifting contest in the square, betting 10 gp that contestants can't lift his barrel. The barrel is empty, but he can cast *hold person* (DC 15) to ensure failure.

**Variation:** He's part of a larger con ring (pickpockets work the crowd), or he's a former adventurer testing for worthy recruits.

**Non-Combat:** Detecting the magic (DC 14 Arcana or Insight) exposes the con. Winning despite cheating earns respect and he might become a useful contact (knows all the cons, scams, and criminals in the city). Exposing him publicly gets city guard attention.
