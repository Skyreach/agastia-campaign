# Territorial Owlbear

**Roll:** 10 on 2d8

The earth shakes with heavy footfalls. An owlbear crashes through the underbrush, feathers bristling and beak clacking. It's protecting its nearby nest and views all intruders as threats.

**Variation:** The owlbear is diseased or maddened by corrupted water, making it even more aggressive and unpredictable (add 10 HP, disadvantage to calm it).

**Non-Combat:** A successful DC 16 Animal Handling check or offering 3 days of rations as a peace offering makes it back down; the party can choose to investigate the nest (containing a shiny obsidian egg worth 50 gp to collectors).
