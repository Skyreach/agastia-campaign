# Hermit's Cave

**Roll:** 7 on 2d10

A thin column of smoke rises from a shallow cave. Inside, an elderly human (scout stats) lives in solitude, studying the stars and keeping records of mountain weather. He's eccentric but knowledgeable.

**Variation:** He's actually a retired assassin hiding from old enemies, or he's being slowly driven mad by proximity to a corrupted shrine.

**Non-Combat:** Trading news from civilization or helping with chores earns a detailed map of the area including hidden paths and hazards (advantage on Survival checks in these mountains for 3 days).
