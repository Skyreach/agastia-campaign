# Green Dragon's Domain

**Roll:** 16 on 2d8

The forest grows unnaturally quiet and dark. Acrid fog rolls between the trees. A green dragon wyrmling watches from a high branch, studying the party with ancient, intelligent eyes. It speaks, offering a "trade"—”information for secrets, or safe passage for tribute.

**Variation:** The wyrmling is genuinely curious and might become a recurring NPC if treated well, or it's setting up an ambush with goblin allies hidden nearby.

**Non-Combat:** Clever negotiation, offering valuable information (secrets about local politics, treasure locations), or appealing to its vanity can result in the wyrmling letting the party pass or even granting a warning about nearby dangers. The wyrmling might demand one magic item or 50 gp in tribute.
