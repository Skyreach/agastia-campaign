# Phase Spider

**Roll:** 13 on 2d8

Reality shimmers as a phase spider flickers in and out of the Ethereal Plane, stalking the party. Its ethereal webs are almost invisible, and it attacks from unexpected angles.

**Variation:** It's protecting an egg sac (worth 100 gp to collectors), or it's been summoned/controlled by a desert wizard.

**Non-Combat:** *See invisibility* or similar magic reveals its patterns. Destroying its web anchor points (DC 14 Perception to find, then Athletics to break) forces it to flee. Its lair contains victims' treasures (3d20 gp).
