# Oasis Haven

**Roll:** 2 on 2d8

A beautiful oasis appears—”palm trees, fresh water, shade, and fruit. A disguised couatl (appearing as a beggar woman) tests the party's generosity by asking for water.

**Variation:** The oasis is real but protected by a territorial brass dragon wyrmling who demands stories in exchange for access, or it's a mirage hiding a far more modest (but real) water source.

**Non-Combat:** Sharing water freely with the beggar earns the couatl's blessing (remove one level of exhaustion for each party member, or a charm granting advantage against being frightened). Refusing reveals the test but grants nothing.
