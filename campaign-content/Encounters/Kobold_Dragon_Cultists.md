# Kobold Dragon Cultists

**Roll:** 11 on 2d6

Fanatical kobolds wearing makeshift white dragon symbols ambush from snow banks. They serve a white dragon wyrmling they've proclaimed as their god and attack in its name with zealous fury.

**Variation:** The wyrmling watches from a high ice cliff, swooping down to "save" its followers if they're losing.

**Non-Combat:** Showing respect for their "god" (DC 15 Persuasion or Performance) or convincing them you serve a greater dragon makes them hesitate, potentially leading to information about their lair.
