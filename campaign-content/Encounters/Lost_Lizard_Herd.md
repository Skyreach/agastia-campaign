# Lost Lizard Herd

**Roll:** 5 on 2d8

A dozen giant lizards scatter across the dunes, spooked by something. They're not hostile unless cornered, but they're also valuable—”each could be a mount with proper training.

**Variation:** Whatever spooked them (gnolls, giant scorpions, or a blue dragon wyrmling) arrives in 1d4 rounds. **Non-combat:** Successful animal handling (DC 15) captures 1d4 lizards as potential mounts. Following their backtrail reveals what frightened them and potentially treasure from their flight source.
