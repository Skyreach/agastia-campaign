# Stray Dog Pack

**Roll:** 6 on 2d10

A group of stray mastiffs corners the party in an alley, not attacking but demanding food. They're hungry, not vicious.

**Variation:** The dogs are protecting street children who hide nearby, or they're diseased (Con saves for anyone bitten).

**Non-Combat:** Tossing food (any rations) satisfies them. Befriending them (DC 12 Animal Handling) makes them follow the party, potentially useful for tracking or warnings. The street children, if found, know secret passages through the city (sewer routes, rooftop paths).
