# Winter Wolf Pack

**Roll:** 10 on 2d6

Howls echo across the waste. Winter wolves materialize from the snow, their white fur making them nearly invisible. They circle, testing the party for weakness.

**Variation:** The pack alpha is enormous (add 15 HP, extra attack) or a werewolf leads them.

**Non-Combat:** A show of strength (intimidation check, displaying fire, or successfully standing ground) makes the pack back down. They're hunting elk, not desperate for humanoid prey.
