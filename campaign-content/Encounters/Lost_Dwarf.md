# Lost Dwarf

**Roll:** 5 on 2d6

A waterlogged dwarf, tied to a floating log, calls weakly for help. He's a merchant who was robbed and left to die by bandits upriver. He's got information and reward money—”if he survives.

**Variation:** He's actually a were-dwarf who transforms at night, or the bandits are still nearby tracking him to ensure he dies.

**Non-Combat:** Rescuing him earns gratitude and 25 gp immediately, plus information about bandit camps, swamp hazards, and a promised reward of 100 gp if returned to his home city. He knows the location of a safe dry camp nearby.
