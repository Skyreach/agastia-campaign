# Crystal Passage Ambush

**Roll:** 10 or 11 on 2d6 (Underdark Crystal Encounters) - Can be used for either

A narrow passage lined with red crystal formations. As you approach, two threats emerge: a rust monster scuttles excitedly toward your metal equipment while a humanoid construct of jagged crystal shards activates with a grinding sound, blocking your path forward.

## Encounter Setup

**Creatures:**

**Hazards:** Red crystal formations line walls and ceiling

**Initial Positions:**

## Encounter Phases

### Phase 1: Detection (30-40 feet out)

**Rust Monster Detects Party:**
- Sniffs air excitedly (Iron Scent ability)
- Scuttles toward metal equipment (not hostile yet)
- Chittering, clicking sounds

**Crystal Guardian:**
- Remains motionless (False Appearance active)
- DC 15 Investigation to identify as construct
- Activates if party approaches within 30 feet OR attacks crystals

### Phase 2: Engagement

**Rust Monster:**
- Approaches heavily armored character
- Tries to touch equipment with antennae (not attacking, investigating)
- Becomes hostile if attacked or driven from crystals

**Crystal Guardian:**
- Activates with grinding crystalline sound
- Body pulses with red light
- Positions to block passage
- Uses Multiattack on nearest threat

### Phase 3: Full Combat

**Rust Monster Tactics:**
- Targets shields/armor with Antennae
- Bite attacks as secondary
- Retreats below 10 HP to crystal cluster
- Defends crystals if threatened

**Construct Tactics:**
- Guards passage and crystal core
- Prioritizes threats to core
- Does not pursue beyond 30 feet
- Becomes aggressive if core discovered

## Tactical Challenges

**For Armored PCs:**
- Rust monster devastates AC and equipment
- Must choose: protect gear or focus on construct
- Non-metal weapons suddenly valuable

**For Casters:**
- Construct's Reflective Crystals creates risk
- Area spells might hit both creatures
- *Dispel magic* useful on construct

**For Ranged:**
- Narrow passage limits movement
- Rust monster fast (40 ft speed)
- Construct blocks line of sight

**Environmental:**
- Crystal formations provide half cover
- Destroying crystals angers rust monster
- Finding core crystal disables construct

## Non-Combat Solutions

### Distract Rust Monster
- Drop metal object (rations tin, pitons, crowbar)
- Rust monster happily consumes for 1d4 rounds
- Cost: 5-50 gp depending on item
- Allows focus on construct or bypass

### Destroy Crystal Core
- DC 12 Investigation (bonus action) to notice pulsing
- Core: AC 13, 10 HP, vulnerable to bludgeoning
- Located behind construct (ranged attack or reach weapon)
- Construct collapses immediately

### Lure Rust Monster Away
- Drop metal 30+ feet back down passage
- DC 12 Animal Handling or Survival
- Success: Rust monster follows, reduces encounter to CR 1

### Avoid Entirely
- DC 15 Stealth group check before rust monster detects metal
- Requires party to pass while rust monster feeds
- Construct remains inactive if not approached

### Intimidate/Charm
- DC 13 Intimidation on rust monster (fire, loud noise)
- Success: Backs off, allows passage
- No effect on construct (mindless)

## Rewards

**Loot:**
- Crystal shards (2d6 pieces, 5-10 gp each, faint glow)
- Red crystal core if intact (50 gp, arcane focus)
- Metallic residue from rust monster stomach (2d10 gp salvageable metal)
- Rust monster antennae (20 gp, spell component)

**Experience:**
- 450 XP if both defeated
- 350 XP if construct disabled via core + rust monster handled non-lethally
- 300 XP if one avoided/bypassed
- 200 XP if both avoided via stealth

**Mistfallen Observation Points:**
- **Positive:** Destroyed core instead of construct (shows intelligence), distracted rust monster (shows wisdom), avoided combat (shows restraint)
- **Negative:** Killed both when avoidable (unnecessary violence), destroyed multiple crystals (attacking their defenses)
- **Neutral:** Fought both directly (shows strength but not necessarily wisdom)

## DM Notes

### Difficulty Adjustments

**Too Easy:**
- Rust monster starts 20 feet closer
- Construct has 40 HP instead of 33
- Add second rust monster

**Too Hard:**
- Remove Reflective Crystals from construct
- Rust monster has 20 HP instead of 27
- Make crystal core more obvious (bright pulsing, DC 10 to notice)

**Party Has No Metal:**
- Replace rust monster with Violet Fungi (CR 1/4, 3 fungi)
- Or make rust monster non-hostile (just curious)

### Pacing Suggestions

**First Encounter with Either Creature:**
- Give clear description of threats
- Allow Investigation checks before initiative
- Emphasize rust monster isn't immediately hostile

**Mid-Journey:**
- Party should recognize red crystals = danger
- May remember core destruction from previous construct
- Rust monster becomes expected hazard

**Near Falls:**
- Increase tension (getting close)
- Party might be low on resources
- Non-combat solutions more valuable

### Flavor Descriptions

**Rust Monster:**
- Chittering mandibles, twitching antennae
- Scuttles sideways like crab
- Satisfied purring when feeding on metal
- Crystal shards glitter in carapace

**Construct:**
- Grinding crystal-on-crystal movement
- Crystals crack but reform when hit
- Red glow suggests "eyes" where head should be
- Shatters dramatically into shards when destroyed

**Environment:**
- Red crystals pulse with dim light (60 ft radius)
- Narrow passage with limited maneuvering room
- Metallic dust and rust on floor
- Skeletal remains with rusted equipment (previous victims)

### Connection to Lore

**Rust Monster:**
- Example of crystal corruption affecting Underdark creatures
- Not mind-controlled but mutated/attracted to crystal energy
- Shows crystals' influence beyond direct control

**Construct:**
- Mistfallen defensive magic in action
- Similar to creature control but more advanced
- Finn (young artisan) might have created this
- Shows tribe's capabilities and desperation

**Together:**
- Demonstrates both crystal effects: corruption (monster) and control (construct)
- Foreshadows what party will learn about Mistfallen
- Tests party's problem-solving under pressure

## Alternative Configurations

### Solo Encounters

**Rust Monster Only (CR 1/2):**
- Use when party is low on resources
- Focus on equipment threat
- More non-combat solutions available

**Construct Only (CR 1):**
- Use as straight combat or puzzle
- Emphasize core destruction mechanic
- Tests party's observation skills

### Combined With Other Threats

**+ Violet Fungi (add CR 1/4 each):**
- Fungi growing near crystals
- Creates hazardous terrain
- Forces movement/positioning decisions

**+ Darkmantles (add CR 1/2 each):**
- Attached to ceiling crystals
- Drop on party during combat
- Increases chaos and danger
