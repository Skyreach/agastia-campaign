# Crystal Passage Ambush

**Roll:** 10 or 11 on 2d6 (Underdark Crystal Encounters) - Can be used for either

A narrow passage lined with red crystal formations. As you approach, two threats emerge: a rust monster scuttles excitedly toward your metal equipment while a humanoid construct of jagged crystal shards activates with a grinding sound, blocking your path forward.

## Encounter Setup

**Creatures:**
- 1 Rust Monster (CR 1/2) - Crystal-Corrupted
- 1 Crystal Guardian Construct (CR 5) - Mind-Controlled

**Combined CR:** ~5.5 (1,900 XP total) - Deadly encounter for level 3 party
**Terrain:** Narrow passage (10-15 ft wide, 60 ft long)
**Hazards:** Red crystal formations line walls and ceiling

**Initial Positions:**
- **Rust Monster:** 30 feet ahead, feeding near crystal cluster
- **Crystal Guardian:** 50 feet ahead, motionless among crystals (False Appearance)
- **Red Crystal Core:** Behind construct, embedded in wall (powers construct)

## Creatures

### Rust Monster (Crystal-Corrupted) - CR 1/2

**AC 14 | HP 27 (5d8+5) | Speed 40 ft.**

**STR** 13 (+1) | **DEX** 12 (+1) | **CON** 13 (+1) | **INT** 2 (-4) | **WIS** 13 (+1) | **CHA** 6 (-2)

**Senses:** Darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 11
**CR:** 1/2 (100 XP)

**Iron Scent:** Can pinpoint location of ferrous metal within 30 feet by scent.

**Rust Metal:** Nonmagical metal weapons that hit corrode (cumulative -1 penalty, destroyed at -5). Metal ammunition destroyed after dealing damage.

**Actions:**
- **Bite:** +3 to hit, 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d8+1) piercing damage.
- **Antennae:** Corrodes nonmagical ferrous metal object within 5 feet. If worn/carried, target makes DC 11 Dex save to avoid. Metal armor/shields take permanent -1 AC penalty (destroyed at AC 10/+0). Weapons rust per Rust Metal trait.

**Crystal-Corrupted Features:**
- Red crystal shards embedded in carapace
- Eyes glow with faint red light
- Attracted to both metal AND crystal formations
- Will defend crystals if threatened

### Crystal Guardian Construct - CR 5

**AC 18 | HP 93 (11d10+33) | Speed 30 ft.**

**STR** 18 (+4) | **DEX** 11 (+0) | **CON** 16 (+3) | **INT** 1 (-5) | **WIS** 3 (-4) | **CHA** 1 (-5)

**Damage Immunities:** Poison, Psychic, Fire
**Damage Resistances:** Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing from nonmagical attacks
**Condition Immunities:** Blinded, Charmed, Deafened, Exhausted, Frightened, Paralyzed, Petrified, Poisoned
**Senses:** Blindsight 60 ft. (blind beyond), passive Perception 6
**CR:** 5 (1,800 XP)

**Antimagic Susceptibility:** Incapacitated in *antimagic field*. *Dispel magic*: DC 15 Con save or unconscious 1 minute.

**False Appearance:** While motionless near crystals, indistinguishable from crystal formation (DC 15 Investigation to detect).

**Crystal Body:** Destroying red crystal core (AC 15, 30 HP, resistant to all damage except bludgeoning which bypasses resistance, within 20 ft) instantly disables construct.

**Reflective Crystals:** When hit by damaging spell, roll 1d6. On 4-6, spell reflects at caster. Once per round.

**Regeneration:** The construct regains 10 HP at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 HP and is within 30 feet of its crystal core. If the construct takes bludgeoning damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of its next turn.

**Actions:**
- **Multiattack:** Three slam attacks.
- **Slam:** +7 to hit, 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d8+4) bludgeoning damage + target makes DC 15 Con save or takes 7 (2d6) piercing damage from crystal shards and is knocked prone.
- **Crystal Shockwave (Recharge 5-6):** The construct slams the ground, sending crystal shards in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

## Encounter Phases

### Phase 1: Detection (30-40 feet out)

**Rust Monster Detects Party:**
- Sniffs air excitedly (Iron Scent ability)
- Scuttles toward metal equipment (not hostile yet)
- Chittering, clicking sounds

**Crystal Guardian:**
- Remains motionless (False Appearance active)
- DC 15 Investigation to identify as construct
- Activates if party approaches within 30 feet OR attacks crystals

### Phase 2: Engagement

**Rust Monster:**
- Approaches heavily armored character
- Tries to touch equipment with antennae (not attacking, investigating)
- Becomes hostile if attacked or driven from crystals

**Crystal Guardian:**
- Activates with grinding crystalline sound
- Body pulses with red light
- Positions to block passage
- Uses Multiattack on nearest threat

### Phase 3: Full Combat

**Rust Monster Tactics:**
- Targets shields/armor with Antennae
- Bite attacks as secondary
- Retreats below 10 HP to crystal cluster
- Defends crystals if threatened

**Construct Tactics:**
- Guards passage and crystal core aggressively
- Uses Multiattack (three slams) to devastating effect
- Prioritizes threats to core, positions to protect it
- Uses Crystal Shockwave when 2+ enemies are clustered
- Regenerates 10 HP per turn (vulnerable to bludgeoning damage to stop this)
- Does not pursue beyond 30 feet from core
- Becomes extremely aggressive if core is attacked

## Tactical Challenges

**For Armored PCs:**
- Rust monster devastates AC and equipment
- Must choose: protect gear or focus on construct
- Non-metal weapons suddenly valuable

**For Casters:**
- Construct's Reflective Crystals creates HIGH risk (4-6 on d6 reflects)
- Area spells might hit both creatures (but also damage core if positioned right)
- *Dispel magic* useful on construct (DC 15 Con save)
- Regeneration makes damage spells less effective
- Bludgeoning cantrips (*magic stone*) stop regeneration

**For Ranged:**
- Narrow passage limits movement
- Rust monster fast (40 ft speed)
- Construct blocks line of sight

**Environmental:**
- Crystal formations provide half cover
- Destroying crystals angers rust monster
- Finding core crystal disables construct (CRITICAL to success)
- Narrow passage means Crystal Shockwave can hit multiple PCs
- Construct regenerates near core - must separate or destroy core quickly

## Non-Combat Solutions

### Distract Rust Monster
- Drop metal object (rations tin, pitons, crowbar)
- Rust monster happily consumes for 1d4 rounds
- Cost: 5-50 gp depending on item
- Allows focus on construct or bypass

### Destroy Crystal Core
- DC 12 Investigation (bonus action) to notice pulsing
- Core: AC 15, 30 HP, resistant to all damage except bludgeoning (bypasses resistance)
- Located behind construct (ranged attack or reach weapon needed)
- Construct collapses immediately when core destroyed
- **Critical:** This is the key to victory - direct combat is deadly for level 3 party

### Lure Rust Monster Away
- Drop metal 30+ feet back down passage
- DC 12 Animal Handling or Survival
- Success: Rust monster follows, reduces encounter to CR 1

### Avoid Entirely
- DC 15 Stealth group check before rust monster detects metal
- Requires party to pass while rust monster feeds
- Construct remains inactive if not approached

### Intimidate/Charm
- DC 13 Intimidation on rust monster (fire, loud noise)
- Success: Backs off, allows passage
- No effect on construct (mindless)

## Rewards

**Loot:**
- Crystal shards (2d6 pieces, 5-10 gp each, faint glow)
- Red crystal core if intact (50 gp, arcane focus)
- Metallic residue from rust monster stomach (2d10 gp salvageable metal)
- Rust monster antennae (20 gp, spell component)

**Experience:**
- 1,900 XP if both defeated in combat
- 1,800 XP if construct disabled via core + rust monster defeated
- 1,500 XP if construct disabled via core + rust monster avoided
- 1,000 XP if both avoided via stealth (awarded for clever problem-solving)

**Mistfallen Observation Points:**
- **Positive:** Destroyed core instead of construct (shows intelligence), distracted rust monster (shows wisdom), avoided combat (shows restraint)
- **Negative:** Killed both when avoidable (unnecessary violence), destroyed multiple crystals (attacking their defenses)
- **Neutral:** Fought both directly (shows strength but not necessarily wisdom)

## DM Notes

### Difficulty Adjustments

**Too Easy (for level 4-5 party):**
- Construct has 120 HP instead of 93
- Reduce core HP vulnerability window (only bludgeoning works)
- Add second rust monster

**Too Hard (for level 3 party):**
- **Recommended:** Ensure party discovers core mechanic early (NPC hint, obvious pulsing)
- Reduce construct HP to 70
- Remove Regeneration ability
- Make crystal core more obvious (bright pulsing, DC 10 to notice)
- Crystal Shockwave recharges on 6 only

**Party Has No Metal:**
- Replace rust monster with Violet Fungi (CR 1/4, 3 fungi)
- Or make rust monster non-hostile (just curious)

**CRITICAL NOTE:** This is a deadly encounter for level 3 party if fought head-on. Players SHOULD use puzzle solution (destroy core) or avoid combat. If they engage directly without discovering core mechanic, consider dropping hints or having Mistfallen scouts intervene.

### Pacing Suggestions

**First Encounter with Either Creature:**
- Give clear description of threats
- Allow Investigation checks before initiative
- Emphasize rust monster isn't immediately hostile

**Mid-Journey:**
- Party should recognize red crystals = danger
- May remember core destruction from previous construct
- Rust monster becomes expected hazard

**Near Falls:**
- Increase tension (getting close)
- Party might be low on resources
- Non-combat solutions more valuable

### Flavor Descriptions

**Rust Monster:**
- Chittering mandibles, twitching antennae
- Scuttles sideways like crab
- Satisfied purring when feeding on metal
- Crystal shards glitter in carapace

**Construct:**
- Grinding crystal-on-crystal movement
- Crystals crack but reform when hit
- Red glow suggests "eyes" where head should be
- Shatters dramatically into shards when destroyed

**Environment:**
- Red crystals pulse with dim light (60 ft radius)
- Narrow passage with limited maneuvering room
- Metallic dust and rust on floor
- Skeletal remains with rusted equipment (previous victims)

### Connection to Lore

**Rust Monster:**
- Example of crystal corruption affecting Underdark creatures
- Not mind-controlled but mutated/attracted to crystal energy
- Shows crystals' influence beyond direct control

**Construct:**
- Mistfallen defensive magic in action
- Similar to creature control but more advanced
- Finn (young artisan) might have created this
- Shows tribe's capabilities and desperation

**Together:**
- Demonstrates both crystal effects: corruption (monster) and control (construct)
- Foreshadows what party will learn about Mistfallen
- Tests party's problem-solving under pressure

## Alternative Configurations

### Solo Encounters

**Rust Monster Only (CR 1/2):**
- Use when party is low on resources
- Focus on equipment threat
- More non-combat solutions available

**Construct Only (CR 1):**
- Use as straight combat or puzzle
- Emphasize core destruction mechanic
- Tests party's observation skills

### Combined With Other Threats

**+ Violet Fungi (add CR 1/4 each):**
- Fungi growing near crystals
- Creates hazardous terrain
- Forces movement/positioning decisions

**+ Darkmantles (add CR 1/2 each):**
- Attached to ceiling crystals
- Drop on party during combat
- Increases chaos and danger
