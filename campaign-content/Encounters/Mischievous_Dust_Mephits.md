# Mischievous Dust Mephits

**Roll:** 4 on 2d8

Giggling dust devils spin across the sands—”dust mephits play in the heat, creating sandstorms and hiding the party's tracks. They're more annoying than dangerous, stealing small objects and creating visibility problems.

**Variation:** A dao watches from a distance, using the mephits to test visitors to its territory.

**Non-Combat:** Playing along with their games (skill challenge—”athletics, performance, acrobatics) entertains them; they reward good sports with knowledge of a nearby shelter or water source.
