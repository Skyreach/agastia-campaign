# Grick Ambush

**Roll:** 12 on 2d8

Stone outcroppings line the forest path—”except they're not stone. Gricks slither from rocky crevices, their tentacles probing for prey. They've been starving and desperate for weeks.

**Variation:** One grick is much larger (use grick alpha stats if available, or double HP), the alpha of the pack.

**Non-Combat:** Tossing fresh meat (3 rations worth) into the rocks distracts them long enough to flee; following their trails leads to a cave filled with bones and 3d20 gp in coins.
