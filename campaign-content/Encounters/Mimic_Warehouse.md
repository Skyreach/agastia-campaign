# Mimic Warehouse

**Roll:** 20 on 2d10

A treasure-filled warehouse seems too good to be true—”because several chests, doors, and even a barrel are mimics waiting for prey. They've been here for months, patient and hungry.

**Variation:** A single large mimic (double HP) dominates, or the warehouse owner is a doppelganger using mimics as guards.

**Non-Combat:** Detecting mimics (DC 14 Investigation before touching) allows avoidance or using them as traps against enemies. Real treasures exist among the mimics (5d20 gp in goods). Smoke or specific alchemical mixtures (DC 15 Arcana) drive mimics away. The warehouse's actual owner doesn't know about the infestation and will pay 75 gp for clearing it.
