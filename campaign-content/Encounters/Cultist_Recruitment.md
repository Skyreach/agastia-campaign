# Cultist Recruitment

**Roll:** 10 on 2d10

Two cult fanatics approach the party, offering wealth, power, and purpose if they join their organization. They're disturbingly earnest about serving their dark god.

**Variation:** They're recruiting for a demon cult (immediate danger), or they serve an evil but lawful deity (organized, less immediately threatening).

**Non-Combat:** Pretending interest (DC 14 Deception) gets an invitation to their meeting place (information gathering opportunity). Refusing firmly makes them leave. Attacking draws guard attention. Following them leads to their temple (potential adventure hook).
