# Blue Dragon Wyrmling

**Roll:** 14 on 2d8

Thunder rumbles from clear skies. A vain blue dragon wyrmling patrols the coastline, claiming the beach as its territory. It's arrogant and territorial but intelligent.

**Variation:** It commands a tribe of kobolds who fortify beach caves, or it's unusually aggressive (fighting a rival bronze dragon).

**Non-Combat:** Flattery and tribute (gems worth 50+ gp) satisfy its vanity. It might share information about coastal threats, safe harbors, or underwater dangers in exchange for proper respect. Unlike savage whites, it can be negotiated with—”it values intelligence and cunning.
