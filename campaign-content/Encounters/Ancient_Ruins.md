# Ancient Ruins

**Roll:** 6 on 2d8

Half-buried stone columns and crumbling walls mark an ancient settlement swallowed by sand. Strange symbols warn of curses, but the structure might offer shelter from the sun.

**Variation:** The ruins are protected by mummies or animated skeletons, or they contain a working shrine that grants blessings.

**Non-Combat:** Excavating carefully (DC 13 Investigation) reveals a sealed chamber with preserved supplies (water, rations) and 3d20 gp in ancient coins. The shade provides refuge from desert heat (advantage on saves against exhaustion).
