# Magma Vent

**Roll:** 15 on 2d10

Superheated air blasts from a crack in the mountain. Magma mephits and magmin bubble up from the depths, playful and destructive in equal measure. They're drawn to warmth and fire.

**Variation:** An azer craftsman works at a natural forge nearby, willing to trade metalwork for protection from the pests, or the vent is growing, threatening to explode.

**Non-Combat:** Sealing the vent (DC 16 Investigation + appropriate magic or tools) stops the emergence. The superheated area can be used to forge or repair metal equipment with advantage.
