# Shipwreck

**Roll:** 6 on 2d8

The skeletal remains of a merchant vessel jut from the surf, barnacle-covered and weathered. Seabirds nest in its rigging, and fish swim through its hold.

**Variation:** The ship is haunted by the ghost of its captain seeking proper burial, or sahuagin use it as a forward operating base.

**Non-Combat:** Exploring the wreck (DC 13 Investigation, requires swimming/wading) reveals a sealed captain's chest containing 3d20 gp, a waterlogged map to treasure, and possibly a still-functional magic item. The ghost, if present, just wants its body found and buried (specific grave marker on distant beach).
