# Helpful Sprite Circle

**Roll:** 2 on 2d8

A ring of mushrooms glows faintly in a moonlit glade where sprites feast on honeyed cakes and fermented berry wine. They're jovial and welcoming—”offering the party rest, food, and magical guidance in exchange for stories or songs. The sprites can point toward nearby points of interest, warn of dangers ahead, or grant a minor blessing (advantage on next Survival check).

**Variation:** One sprite is actually a disguised pixie with access to polymorph and confusion, testing the party's worthiness.

**Non-Combat:** The sprites offer to become allies if the party plants enchanted acorns at three specific locations, creating new faerie rings across the forest.
