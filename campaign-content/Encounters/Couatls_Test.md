# Couatl's Test

**Roll:** 3 on 2d10

A magnificent feathered serpent coils around a ancient tree, its rainbow scales gleaming. The couatl observes the party with benevolent but judging eyes, testing their worthiness with a question or request.

**Variation:** The couatl is injured and needs healing, or it guards a sacred grove and demands the party prove they mean no harm.

**Non-Combat:** Answering truthfully, showing kindness to nature, or helping with a task (clearing corruption, healing wounded animals) earns the couatl's blessing (charm that grants one free use of *cure wounds* or *lesser restoration*). It may also provide prophecy or guidance.
