# Friendly Lizardfolk Village

**Roll:** 2 on 2d10

Wooden platforms built in the trees mark a lizardfolk settlement. The inhabitants are cautious but not hostile, curious about outsiders. Their shaman seeks ingredients for healing rituals and will trade information for help.

**Variation:** They're preparing defenses against a young green dragon that's been harassing them, or yuan-ti infiltrators hide among them.

**Non-Combat:** Helping gather medicinal plants (DC 12 Nature or Survival) earns goodwill, maps of safe paths, warnings about territorial dinosaurs, and possibly a guide for 5 gp per day. They can also teach jungle survival techniques (advantage on next Survival check).
