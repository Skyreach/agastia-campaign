# Talking Statue

**Roll:** 18 on 2d10

An elven woman statue in the town square suddenly speaks to one party member telepathically: "Kill the others. Live with me forever."

**Variation:** It's a trapped succubus, a test by a local wizard, or an actual cursed artifact.

**Non-Combat:** Investigating reveals the statue's nature (DC 14 Arcana). It might be destroyed, studied for reward (wizard pays 100 gp for information), or ignored. Succumbing to its influence leads to charmed condition and potential combat with party. Resisting proves mental fortitude.
