# Frozen Dead

**Roll:** 9 on 2d6

Humanoid shapes lurch through a blizzard—”zombies, preserved perfectly by the ice. They wear the uniforms of an expedition from decades ago. A frozen noble among them clutches a journal (revealing their fate) and wears a signet ring (worth 25 gp).

**Variation:** The zombies are accompanied by a wight, their former leader, who commands them with tactical precision.

**Non-Combat:** The zombies are slow; outrunning them (DC 12 group Athletics through snow) works. The journal reveals the location of their camp with supplies.
