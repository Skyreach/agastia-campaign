# Fruit Tree Bounty

**Roll:** 5 on 2d10

A massive tree bears strange star-shaped neon green fruits that glow faintly. They smell sweet and inviting. Tribal markings on the trunk suggest local significance.

**Variation:** The fruits are protected by poisonous insects, or eating too many causes hallucinations (DC 13 Con save or trip for 1 hour).

**Non-Combat:** Each fruit restores 1d8+1 HP when eaten (up to 2d10 fruits available). Harvesting draws attention from protective apes or tribal warriors who demand respect for the sacred tree. Proper offerings (shiny objects, tools) earn permission.
