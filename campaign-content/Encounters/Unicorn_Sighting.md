# Unicorn Sighting

**Roll:** 7 on 2d8

A flash of silver-white catches the corner of someone's eye—”a unicorn stands at the forest's edge, watching the party with intelligent eyes. It bolts immediately, but those who saw it feel blessed (advantage on their next saving throw).

**Variation:** If the party can track it (DC 16 Survival check with disadvantage—”it's very fast), they find it wounded by goblin arrows, creating a moral choice.

**Non-Combat:** Healing the unicorn (or choosing not to pursue it) grants a more powerful blessing: the unicorn's horn glows and leaves behind a single silver hair that can cure one disease or poison (no action required).
