# Rockslide

**Roll:** 9 on 2d10

A distant rumble grows louder—”tons of rock and scree cascade down the mountainside. Either natural or triggered by something above.

**Variation:** Orcs deliberately caused the rockslide to block pursuit or trap the party, or a remorhaz burrowing caused the collapse.

**Non-Combat:** A DC 15 Perception check provides warning to seek shelter. Successfully sheltering takes no damage; caught in the open requires DC 14 Dex saves to avoid 3d6 bludgeoning damage. The debris field might reveal a cave entrance previously hidden.
