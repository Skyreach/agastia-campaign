# Goblin Parade

**Roll:** 8 on 2d10

Goblins wearing a convincing human costume stumble through the streets, trying to blend in. It's not working. They're trying to shop for their boss (a bigger goblin).

**Variation:** They're spies for a goblin tribe planning a sewer raid, or they actually have legitimate business (employed by eccentric wizard).

**Non-Combat:** Helping them shop or calling out their disguise leads to different outcomes. They might trade information about sewer systems, offer crude maps, or flee in panic (dropping 2d10 gp in coins). Following them leads to their boss or hideout.
