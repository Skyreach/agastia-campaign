# Friendly Reindeer Herders

**Roll:** 2 on 2d6

A group of tribal warriors wrapped in thick furs tends a herd of elk (reindeer). They're friendly and offer to share hot stew, warm furs, and directions. Their elder speaks of "the white winds growing darker" and can provide a guide for 10 gp per day.

**Variation:** One of the herders is a werebear in human form, protecting the tribe from afar.

**Non-Combat:** The tribe offers shelter for the night; accepting grants advantage on saves against exhaustion from cold for 24 hours. They can also trade supplies (rations, cold-weather gear).
