# Rope Bridge

**Roll:** 5 on 2d10

An ancient rope bridge spans a massive chasm. It sways dangerously in the wind, and several planks are missing or rotted. A weathered sign warns: "Cross at own risk."

**Variation:** Harpies nest beneath the bridge and attack anyone crossing, or a stone giant on the far side is repairing the bridge and can be convinced to help.

**Non-Combat:** Clever engineering (DC 13 Investigation + Rope Use) reinforces the bridge safely. Finding an alternate route (DC 15 Survival) takes 2 hours but avoids all danger.
