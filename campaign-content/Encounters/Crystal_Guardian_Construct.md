# Crystal Guardian Construct

**Roll:** 11 on 2d6 (Underdark Crystal Encounters)

A humanoid form made of jagged red crystal shards blocks the passage ahead. The construct stands motionless, nearly indistinguishable from the crystal formations around it until it activates with a grinding, crystalline sound. Its body pulses with dim red light in rhythm, like a heartbeat.

## Encounter Details

**Creature:** 1 Crystal Guardian Construct (CR 1)
**Theme:** Mind-Controlled
**Challenge:** Combat or puzzle encounter

**Ambush Setup:**
- Positioned near red crystal formation in narrow passage
- While motionless, appears to be part of natural crystal cluster
- DC 15 Investigation to notice it's a construct before activation
- Activates when party approaches within 30 feet or attacks crystals

**AC:** 18 (natural armor - crystalline shell)
**HP:** 33 (6d8 + 6)
**Speed:** 25 ft.

**CR:** 1 (200 XP)

### Special Abilities

**Antimagic Susceptibility:** Incapacitated in *antimagic field*. Targeted by *dispel magic*: Con save vs caster's DC or fall unconscious for 1 minute.

**False Appearance:** While motionless near red crystals, indistinguishable from natural crystal outcropping (DC 15 Investigation).

**Crystal Body:** Made of red crystal shards held by Mistfallen magic. When destroyed, shatters into fragments. **Red Crystal Core** (hidden nearby, DC 12 Investigation): Destroying the power source crystal (AC 13, 10 HP, vulnerable to bludgeoning) instantly disables the construct.

**Reflective Crystals:** When hit by damaging spell, roll 1d6. On 5-6, spell reflects back at caster (original attack/DC). Once per round.

### Actions

**Multiattack:** Two slam attacks.

**Slam:** +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage.
**Crystal Shard:** Target makes DC 12 Con save or takes 2 (1d4) additional piercing damage from embedded crystal shards.

## Tactics

**Combat Behavior:**
1. Activates with grinding sound when party approaches
2. Positions to block passage or protect red crystal core
3. Uses Multiattack on nearest threat
4. Does not pursue if enemies retreat (guards location)
5. Becomes aggressive if core crystal is threatened

**Puzzle Element:**
- Observant players notice crystal core pulsing in sync with construct (DC 12 Investigation as bonus action)
- Core located within 15 feet (embedded in wall/ceiling/floor)
- Glows brighter when construct is active
- Destroying core = instant victory

## Non-Combat Solutions

**Destroy the Crystal Core:**
- DC 12 Investigation during combat to notice pulsing synchronization
- Core: AC 13, HP 10, vulnerable to bludgeoning, immune to poison/psychic
- Destroying it causes construct to collapse immediately
- Rewards clever players who've been breaking crystals throughout journey

**Avoid Entirely:**
- DC 13 Stealth group check to sneak past while construct is inactive
- DC 15 Investigation beforehand to identify it and plan alternate route
- Successful *detect magic* reveals construct's magical aura

**Dispel Magic:**
- DC 13 Charisma save or construct falls unconscious for 1 minute
- Party can destroy it or sneak past

## Rewards

**Loot:**
- Crystal fragments (1d6 pieces, 10 gp each, glow faintly)
- Red crystal core (if intact, 50 gp, can be used as arcane focus)
- Evidence of Mistfallen magic (carved runes on core)

**Experience:**
- 200 XP if defeated in combat
- 200 XP if destroyed via core crystal (puzzle solution)
- 100 XP if avoided via stealth/magic

**Mistfallen Observation:**
- Darva's scouts note if party figured out the crystal connection (positive sign of intelligence)
- Destroying construct without destroying core shows restraint (can study Mistfallen magic)
- Killing it brutally vs. strategically affects Mistfallen's assessment

## DM Notes

**Flavor Description:**
- Crystals grind and scrape when it moves
- When hit, crystals crack but reform
- Reflects light in chaotic patterns
- When destroyed, shatters dramatically into hundreds of shards
- No face, but red glow suggests "eyes" where head would be

**Placement:**
- Use in narrow passages where party can't easily flee
- Position near other crystal formations to enhance False Appearance
- Place crystal core in accessible but not obvious location (behind construct, on ceiling, in alcove)

**Difficulty Adjustment:**
- Too Easy: Add second construct or reduce time to find core
- Too Hard: Give obvious visual cue about core (bright pulsing), reduce HP
- Party struggling: Have freed dragon's voice echo warning about "destroying the source"

**Connection to Lore:**
- This is an example of Mistfallen crystal magic at work
- Similar to how they control frogs/spiders but more advanced
- Shows their defensive capabilities
- Finn (young artisan) could have created this if party meets him later
