# Frozen Shrine

**Roll:** 4 on 2d6

Ice-covered standing stones form a circle around a frozen altar. Ethereal lights dance in the center—”will-o'-wisps or northern lights? Ancient runes mark the stones.

**Variation:** The lights are actually ice mephits playing, or the shrine is sacred to a good deity and grants a blessing if offerings are made (10 gp in coins or valuables).

**Non-Combat:** Reading the runes (DC 13 Religion/Arcana) reveals this is a shrine to a winter god; proper reverence grants resistance to cold damage for 24 hours.
