# Hobgoblin Hunting Party

**Roll:** 13 on 2d8

The crack of branches and barked orders in Goblin heralds the approach of disciplined hobgoblin scouts. They're tracking a thief who stole from their war band—”an urchin who nabbed food to feed his starving siblings.

**Variation:** The hobgoblins are led by a captain who carries a banner marked with the symbol of a distant warlord—”killing him draws attention from a larger force.

**Non-Combat:** The party can negotiate (hobgoblins respect strength and honesty), hand over the thief, hide the thief and bluff (DC 15 Deception), or learn the thief's location is in a nearby hollow tree.
