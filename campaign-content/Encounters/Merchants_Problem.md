# Merchant's Problem

**Roll:** 17 on 2d10

A merchant tries to sell a cursed carpet, claiming it's "haunted" for flavor. It's actually a rug of smothering, and she doesn't know.

**Variation:** She knows and is selling it deliberately (criminal), or she's cursed and compelled to sell cursed items.

**Non-Combat:** Detecting the curse (DC 13 Arcana) allows warning her (earning gratitude and shopping discounts) or buying it cheap to use against enemies. She knows all legitimate merchants in the city and can provide letters of introduction.
