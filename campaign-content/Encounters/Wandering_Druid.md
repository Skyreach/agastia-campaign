# Wandering Druid

**Roll:** 6 on 2d8

An elderly druid sits by a babbling brook, smoking a pipe carved from oak root. She's monitoring the health of the forest and notes that "something dark stirs in the old hollow." She can provide healing, identify plants, and share rumors.

**Variation:** She's actually a green hag in disguise, testing the party's intentions—”if they're cruel to nature, she becomes hostile.

**Non-Combat:** If the party helps her gather medicinal herbs or clear corruption from a nearby grove, she grants them a charm that allows one free casting of *speak with animals*.
