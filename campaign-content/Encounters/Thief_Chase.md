# Thief Chase

**Roll:** 7 on 2d10

A spy sprints through the streets, pursued by city guards. She dodges into an alley where the party stands, gasping for breath. She stole food to feed orphans—”or so she claims.

**Variation:** She's a thieves' guild member with valuable intelligence, or she actually stole something important from a corrupt official.

**Non-Combat:** Hiding her (DC 13 Deception to guards) earns gratitude and a potential ally. She can introduce the party to the thieves' guild, provide information about the city's underworld, or owe a favor. Turning her in earns a 10 gp reward but makes enemies in the guild.
