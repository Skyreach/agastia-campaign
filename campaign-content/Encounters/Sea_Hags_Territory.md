# Sea Hag's Territory

**Roll:** 11 on 2d8

The water turns foul and murky. Dead fish float on the surface. A sea hag lurks below, her horrific appearance enough to frighten even brave souls. She's collecting "beautiful things" (by stealing attractive people).

**Variation:** She leads a coven with two other hags (much more dangerous), or she's polymorphed as a beautiful drowning victim calling for help.

**Non-Combat:** Haggling with her (she loves making deals) might work—”she trades information or passage for beautiful objects, art, or secrets. She can be bribed with gifts worth 50+ gp. Her lair contains treasures from victims (5d20 gp, potentially cursed items).
