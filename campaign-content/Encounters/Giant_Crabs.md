# Giant Crabs

**Roll:** 8 on 2d8

Enormous crabs skitter across tidal rocks, their pincers clacking aggressively. They're territorial but predictable, defending their feeding grounds.

**Variation:** One crab is unusually large (double HP), or they've captured someone in their pincers (still alive, calling for help).

**Non-Combat:** Waiting for low tide when they retreat (1d4 hours), using loud noises to drive them away, or circling through deeper water (requires swimming) avoids them. Their shells can be harvested for lightweight armor materials. Rescued victims offer rewards.
