# Ice Mephit Mischief

**Roll:** 7 on 2d6

Childish laughter echoes across the ice as ice mephits play pranks—”freezing water skins, creating icy patches, throwing snowballs. They're more annoying than dangerous but won't stop unless made to.

**Variation:** A bheur hag watches from afar, using the mephits to test the party's resolve.

**Non-Combat:** Playing along with their games (ability checks in a skill challenge) entertains them enough that they leave peacefully, gifting the party a small ice sculpture worth 10 gp.
