# Giant Constrictor Snake

**Roll:** 15 on 2d10

A massive serpent coils around a ancient statue, nearly indistinguishable from the stone until it moves. It's hungry and patient, waiting for prey to approach what it's coiled around (which might be valuable).

**Variation:** The statue is magical and the snake is protecting it, or the snake has just fed and isn't immediately aggressive.

**Non-Combat:** Waiting until it hunts (it must eat regularly) allows safe approach to the statue. *Speak with animals* or offerings of fresh meat (10 days rations) satisfy it temporarily. The statue might be a petrified person or hold hidden treasure.
