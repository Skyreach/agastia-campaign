# Zombie Ambush

**Roll:** 9 on 2d6

Waterlogged corpses rise from the murky water, muck-covered and moaning. These bog zombies are preserved by the swamp's acidity but still dangerous.

**Variation:** Many more zombies rise (double the number), or a wight commands them from a dry island.

**Non-Combat:** The zombies are slow; running (DC 11 Athletics to wade quickly through terrain) escapes them. They won't pursue beyond their spawning area. The sunken ground they rose from might contain waterlogged valuables (2d20 gp in corroded coins).
