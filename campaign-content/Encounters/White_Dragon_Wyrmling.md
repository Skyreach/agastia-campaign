# White Dragon Wyrmling

**Roll:** 19 on 2d10

Frost coats everything as a white dragon wyrmling swoops from the heights, screeching territorially. Unlike other dragons, it's feral and savage rather than clever—”pure predatory instinct.

**Variation:** The wyrmling is unnaturally large (add 20 HP) or has been magically enslaved by kobolds who follow it.

**Non-Combat:** The wyrmling respects shows of strength more than negotiation—”a successful DC 16 Intimidation check makes it wary enough to circle and leave. Its lair (a frozen cave) contains 5d20 gp worth of frozen coins and gems.
