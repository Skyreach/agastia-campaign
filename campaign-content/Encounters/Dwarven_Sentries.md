# Dwarven Sentries

**Roll:** 2 on 2d10

A watch post built into the mountainside houses several dwarven guards keeping watch over a hidden mine entrance. They're wary but not hostile, demanding to know the party's business. If respectful, the dwarves share ale, mining rumors, and warn of dangers ahead.

**Variation:** One dwarf is actually a duergar spy trying to learn the mine's schedules.

**Non-Combat:** Trading goods (especially alcohol or worked metal) earns goodwill; the dwarves might offer shelter in their guardhouse or mark the party's map with safe paths.
