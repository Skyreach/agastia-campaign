# Tyrannosaur Hunt

**Roll:** 19 on 2d10

The ground shakes with massive footfalls. Trees crash as an enormous predator approaches—”a Tyrannosaurus Rex on the hunt. Its vision is actually quite good, contrary to popular belief, and it's very hungry.

**Variation:** Two tyrannosaurs hunt together (mated pair), or it's being pursued by lizardfolk hunters who might help.

**Non-Combat:** Hiding completely (DC 16 Stealth group check, disadvantage in open areas) lets it pass. Using strong-smelling substances or leading it to recent kill (if available) distracts it. Climbing to safety (it can't climb well) works if escape routes exist. The tyrannosaur might be chasing other prey—”letting it catch that instead saves the party.
