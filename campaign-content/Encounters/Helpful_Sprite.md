# Helpful Sprite

**Roll:** 3 on 2d6

A tiny sprite emerges from a glowing flower, claiming to know the safest paths through the swamp. She's lonely and desperate for conversation but genuinely helpful.

**Variation:** She's fleeing from a hag and asks for protection, or she guards a specific path for the Swamp Queen (a good-aligned treant or fey).

**Non-Combat:** Treating her kindly earns a guided tour through safe paths (no random encounters for 4 hours) and warnings about dangers. She might gift a flower that cures one poison or disease. Harming or threatening her brings bad luck (disadvantage on Survival checks in swamps for 1 week).
