# Cockatrice Glade

**Roll:** 14 on 2d10

A glade filled with beautiful flowers also contains several stone chickens—”failed cockatrices who pecked their reflections in a pool. Living cockatrices strut about, their petrifying beaks a danger to all.

**Variation:** A dozen cockatrices nest here (overwhelming numbers), or someone polymorphed them to guard treasure hidden in the glade.

**Non-Combat:** Throwing meat or grain as distraction allows circumventing the glade. The petrified forms can be studied for alchemical components. The pool's water has minor magic properties (DC 13 Arcana to identify).
