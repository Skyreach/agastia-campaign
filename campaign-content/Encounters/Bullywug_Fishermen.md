# Bullywug Fishermen

**Roll:** 7 on 2d6

Croaking frog-men pole primitive rafts through the shallows, spearing fish with practiced ease. They're initially wary of intruders but cowardly if confronted.

**Variation:** They're led by a bullywug chief (better stats), or they're fleeing from something worse (lizardfolk raiders, a black dragon).

**Non-Combat:** Sharing food or giving gifts (especially shiny objects) makes them friendly. They'll trade information about safe paths, dangerous areas, and swamp hazards for food or trinkets worth 5 gp. Intimidation (DC 11) scares them away entirely.
