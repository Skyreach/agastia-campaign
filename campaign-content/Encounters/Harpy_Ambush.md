# Harpy Ambush

**Roll:** 12 on 2d10

Beautiful songs echo off the cliff faces—”haunting and alluring. Harpies perch on high ledges, their luring song compelling creatures to walk off edges (DC 11 Wisdom save to resist). Below their aerie, bones and loot litter the rocks.

**Variation:** A harpy matriarch (add 10 HP, extra attack) leads the flock, or they're protecting eggs that could be valuable to collectors.

**Non-Combat:** Deafening the party (cotton in ears, *silence* spell) negates the song. Climbing to their aerie while they're away (hunting pattern) allows looting without confrontation (3d20 gp in treasures).
