# Swarm Territory

**Roll:** 8 on 2d10

The air fills with buzzing as thousands of insects rise from rotting vegetation. Bats burst from caves, snakes slither from trees—”the jungle's small dangers become overwhelming in numbers.

**Variation:** Multiple swarms attack at once (insects + bats, or insects + poisonous snakes), or a corrupted area spawns supernatural swarms.

**Non-Combat:** Smoke, fire, or repellent herbs (DC 12 Nature to identify, DC 10 Survival to apply) drive them away. Running through (DC 13 Athletics) escapes the territory. The swarm area might protect something valuable (hidden ruins, fruit trees).
