# Bandit Captain's Ambush

**Roll:** 16 on 2d10

A charming woman tries to lure one party member down a dark alley with promises of valuable information or romance. She's a bandit captain planning an ambush.

**Variation:** She's a succubus (much more dangerous), or she's being coerced by someone worse.

**Non-Combat:** Detecting the trap (DC 15 Insight) allows turning it around. Confronting her before the ambush might lead to negotiation—”she might trade information about her employer for letting her escape. The alley contains her gang's stash (3d20 gp).
