# Fishing Village

**Roll:** 7 on 2d8

A small collection of huts built on stilts over the water houses fishermen and their families. They're wary of strangers but not hostile.

**Variation:** The village is being extorted by sahuagin or bandits, or a sea hag has been stealing children.

**Non-Combat:** Trading goods, sharing news, or buying fish/supplies earns trust. The villagers know all local waters, can provide guides for 5 gp/day, warn about hazards, and might request help with their problem (reward: 50 gp, boat use, or magic fishing net).
