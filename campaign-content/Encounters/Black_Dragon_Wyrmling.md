# Black Dragon Wyrmling

**Roll:** 12 on 2d6

Fetid water bubbles as a black dragon wyrmling emerges from a hollowed stump, acid dripping from its jaws. It's cruel and sadistic, enjoying the fear it causes before attacking.

**Variation:** It has charmed or enslaved bullywugs/kobolds who attack alongside it, or it's younger/weaker than usual (reduce HP by 10).

**Non-Combat:** Black dragons respect cruelty and strength—”showing you're willing to be as vicious as it is (DC 15 Intimidation, describing horrible acts) might make it wary. Tribute works less well than with other dragons—”it prefers suffering to gold. Escaping into terrain it can't easily follow (deep into sticky mud, underwater, or areas requiring climbing) forces it to give up rather than exhaust itself.
