# Lamia's Lair

**Roll:** 16 on 2d8

Crumbling ruins shimmer in the heat. Inside, a lamia reclines on stolen cushions, surrounded by jackalwere servants and charmed slaves. She's decadent, cruel, and bored—”perfect motivation to toy with visitors.

**Variation:** She's working with a jackalwere pack to raid caravans, or she possesses a magic item the party needs.

**Non-Combat:** Engaging her in conversation, wit, or games of chance (she loves gambling) might earn information or safe passage. She respects cunning and charm more than strength. She'll trade information for entertainment or unique treasures. Her slaves can be freed if she's defeated or distracted.
