# Helpful Priest

**Roll:** 2 on 2d10

A kindly acolyte and several priests tend to the sick and poor in a temple district. They offer free healing, sanctuary, and information about the city.

**Variation:** They secretly serve a good deity but the city's corrupt government opposes them, or one acolyte is a spy gathering information on travelers.

**Non-Combat:** Accepting healing or making donations earns goodwill. The clergy know all city rumors, can provide sanctuary if the party gets in trouble, and might offer quests to help the needy. They can also identify cursed items or provide *lesser restoration* services.
