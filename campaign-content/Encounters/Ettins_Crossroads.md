# Ettin's Crossroads

**Roll:** 17 on 2d10

An ettin sits at a fork in the mountain path, its two heads arguing loudly about which direction is "safer." One head wants to eat the party; the other wants to rob them. They can't agree.

**Variation:** The ettin is extraordinarily stupid even for its kind, or clever characters realize the "safer" path leads to the ettin's lair filled with traps.

**Non-Combat:** Exploiting the heads' disagreement (DC 13 Persuasion or Deception to play them against each other) makes them too distracted to fight. Bribing them with food (10 days rations) satisfies the eating head.
