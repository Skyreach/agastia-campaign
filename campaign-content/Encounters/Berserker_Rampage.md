# Berserker Rampage

**Roll:** 15 on 2d10

A crazed berserker smashes through the marketplace, eyes glazed and frothing. He's under the influence of a bad batch of alchemical drugs. His friend (bandit) tries to stop him.

**Variation:** He's been enchanted by a cult, or he's actually possessed and needs exorcism.

**Non-Combat:** Subduing him non-lethally (grappling, *sleep*, calming magic) prevents deaths. His friend explains the drug source (tracking down the dealer is an adventure hook). The city guard arrives in 1d4 rounds—”leaving before then avoids questions.
