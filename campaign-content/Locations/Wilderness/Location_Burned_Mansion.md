# Burned Mansion

## Player Summary

The **Burned Mansion** is a destroyed noble estate that once stood as a symbol of wealth and power in the region. Now only charred walls and crumbling foundations remain, surrounded by overgrown gardens and an atmosphere of tragedy.

The ruins have become a subject of local ghost stories and a potential site for investigation, treasure hunting, or darker purposes.
