# Traveling Carnival

## Player Summary

The **Traveling Carnival** is a mobile entertainment troupe that moves between settlements in the region, bringing performances, games, exotic goods, and spectacle to towns that rarely see such diversions. Led by a charismatic ringmaster, the carnival offers everything from acrobatic performances to fortune telling, from exotic beasts to games of chance. Behind the colorful facade, the carnival serves as a mobile information network and may have connections to various factions operating in the shadows.

### Overview
- **Type:** Mobile entertainment venue
- **Route:** Travels circuit between [[Agastia]], [[Meridian's Rest]], and smaller settlements
- **Population:** 30-50 performers, workers, and hangers-on
- **Frequency:** Visits each settlement 2-4 times per year
- **Stay Duration:** 3-7 days per location
- **Reputation:** Popular entertainment, slightly suspicious undertones

## Description

### Appearance

**From a Distance:**
Colorful tents and wagons arranged in sprawling camp outside town walls. Main tent (big top) dominates with striped canvas in red, gold, and purple. Smaller tents surround it like petals around a flower. Banners and pennants flutter in wind. Smoke from cooking fires. Music and laughter drift on the breeze.

**Up Close:**
- **Main Tent:** 60ft diameter big top with wooden stage
- **Side Tents:** Fortune teller, exotic beasts, freak show, refreshments
- **Wagon Circle:** Performers' living quarters, prop storage, animal cages
- **Game Stalls:** Ringtoss, dart throwing, strength tests, shell games
- **Merchant Area:** Traveling vendors selling carnival-exclusive goods

**Sensory Details:**
- Smell of roasted nuts, caramel apples, spiced meats
- Sound of calliope music, crowd laughter, animal calls
- Sight of acrobats practicing, fire breathers performing, colorful costumes
- Feel of excitement mixed with slight unease (too perfect? too convenient?)

### Atmosphere

**Daytime:** Family-friendly entertainment, children's shows, harmless games, legitimate merchants. Welcoming and cheerful.

**Evening:** More adult entertainment, gambling intensifies, fortune tellers busier, shadowy dealings in less-lit areas. Excitement tinged with danger.
