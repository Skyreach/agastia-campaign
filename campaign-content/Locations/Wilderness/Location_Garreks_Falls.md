# Garrek's Falls

## Player Summary

**Garrek's Falls**, named after the deep gnome explorer who discovered it nearly 170 years ago, is well-known by historians and healers throughout the underground realms, though they do their very best to keep its location a secret. Though the water has incredible healing properties, what can heal can also harm. The water of Garrek's Falls is one of the most addictive substances on the planet, and those who use it have a tendency to crave more and more. Growing ever more rabid in their desire for the healing waters, they become violent and eventually lose themselves to the need.

### Basic Information
- **Type:** Underground waterfall and pool
- **Location:** Deep Underdark, protected by Mistfallen tribe
- **Age:** Ancient (predates discovery by 170 years)
- **Fame:** Known to scholars and healers (location kept secret)
- **Danger Level:** Extreme (addictive properties)
- **Guardian:** Mistfallen tribe (protective isolationists)
- **Status:** Active, accessible to those the Mistfallen deem worthy

### Geography & Features

**The Cavern:**
The sound of rushing water draws you into a cavern illuminated by flashing streaks of red light that play among gravity-defying streams of water. Fed by the roaring torrent crashing through a hole in the ceiling of the cavern, a crystalline pool below beckons you with the sweet scent of lavender and honey. Flashes of crimson light briefly illuminate the depths of the pool, revealing a glimmering bottom of white sand.

**Visual Elements:**
- Gravity-defying water streams (magical phenomenon)
- Flashing red lights (reflections from ceiling crystals)
- Crystalline pool with white sand bottom
- Waterfall from ceiling opening
- Sweet scent of lavender and honey
- Beautiful and beckoning atmosphere
- Otherworldly and ethereal ambiance

**Healing Aura:**
As soon as a creature enters this cavern, it continually benefits from the effects of the **Lesser Restoration** spell. A DC 14 Intelligence (Medicine) check will connect this occurrence with the moisture in the air, which appears to carry some kind of enchantment.

**Hidden Evidence:**
A DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check will reveal skeletal remains in the white sand at the bottom of the pool - victims of the water's addictive curse who drowned while seeking "just one more sip."

### Notable Residents

**Mistfallen Tribe:**
The protective isolationists who guard the Falls. Led by Kethrin (elder/shaman), they observe all visitors and will make contact with those who show wisdom and restraint.

**Key Contacts:**
- **Kethrin:** Elder and shaman who performs cure rituals and controls crystal network
- **Darva:** Scout leader who makes first contact with worthy visitors
- **Finn:** Young artisan curious about surface world, acts as guide/interpreter
- **Morvek:** Caretaker who tends to addicted creatures

## DM Notes

### Hidden Features

**Red Crystal Ceiling:**
The "flashing red lights" in the pool are reflections from **glowing red crystals** embedded in the cavern ceiling. These are the same type used by the Mistfallen tribe to control creatures in the nearby cave network.

**The Water's Dual Nature:**
The healing water contains trace amounts of crystal essence dissolved from the ceiling. This is what gives it both healing properties and addictive qualities. Those who drink become permanently vulnerable to the red crystals' mind control effects (disadvantage on saves).

**The Bone Repository:**
At the pool's bottom are dozens of skeletons - victims of addiction who drowned seeking more water. The Mistfallen leave them as a warning. Some wear armor or carry items that indicate they were powerful adventurers, desperate healers, or dying seekers.

**Secret Passages:**
The Mistfallen have hidden observation posts behind the waterfalls and concealed tunnels leading to their settlement deeper in the Underdark. DC 18 Investigation to spot the subtle markers indicating these passages.

### Encounters

**Mind-Controlled Guardians:**
Journey to the Falls includes encounters with creatures controlled by red crystals (see `Resources/Tables/Underdark_Crystal_Encounters.md` for 2d6 table). Common guardians include:
- Darkmantles attached to crystal formations
- Piercers disguised near crystal choke points
- Quaggoths patrolling key passages
- Larger creatures like hook horrors (addicted, not controlled)

**Mistfallen Scouts (Observation):**
- 2-4 scouts (CR 1/2 each) shadow the party from the moment they destroy the cave crystal
- Darva leads them, assessing the party's worthiness
- Will not engage unless party acts with obvious malice
- Report back to Kethrin about party's behavior

**First Contact Encounter:**
If party shows wisdom at the Falls (investigates before drinking, shows restraint, notices the bones), Kethrin approaches with Darva as security. This is a negotiation encounter, not combat.

**Alternative: Hostile Encounter:**
If party acts with greed (drinks immediately, tries to bottle large amounts, attacks scouts), the Mistfallen will drive them away using crystal-controlled creatures. May result in combat with 4-6 scouts and controlled beasts.

### Factions Present

**Mistfallen Tribe** - Dominant
- Control the Falls and surrounding territory
- Use crystal network for defense
- Desperately need outside help with Chaos Cult corruption
- See `campaign-content/Factions/Faction_Mistfallen_Tribe.md` for complete details

**Chaos Cult** - Threat (Indirect)
- Corrupting crystal network from deeper Underdark
- Have not yet reached the Falls itself
- Future threat if not addressed
- Connection to "old hollow" (Corrupted Grove from Elaris quest)

### Plot Hooks

**Session 4 Opening:**
The green dragon (freed from crystal control in Session 3) can guide the party toward the Falls. Dragon warns them: *"You... broke the chain. The path ahead leads to the Falls. Beautiful. Deadly. I drank the waters when the crystal released me—the clarity was... intoxicating. I wanted more. I barely resisted. The Mistfallen will be watching you."*

**The Addiction Dilemma:**
If a party member drinks and becomes addicted (failed DC 12 Wisdom save), they need Kethrin's cure. This creates leverage for the Mistfallen but also opportunity for alliance. The cure requires staying with the tribe for 1 week, opening up point-crawl exploration.

**The Week-Long Alliance:**
Party staying for cure ritual (or choosing to help the Mistfallen) leads to point-crawl of Underdark territory. Problems to address: Chaos Cult corruption, addicted creatures, failing crystals, rival seekers.

**Agastia Connection:**
Final task sends party back to Agastia to [retrieve/contact/deliver something] for the Mistfallen. This connects Underdark faction to surface campaign and sets up Lyria mystery.

**Connections to Other Quests:**
- **Ghost of Elaris:** Mistfallen can explain the herding operation and why Elaris died (caught in containment meant for addicts)
- **Chaos Cult:** The corruption threatening the Falls ties to larger campaign antagonist
- **Josh's Backstory:** (Future) The red crystals or water could connect to his mysterious markings

### Legendary Location Mechanics

**Key Danger: Just One Sip**
The water of Garrek's Falls is **highly addictive**.

**Addiction Mechanic:**
- Any creature that consumes the water must make a **DC 12 Wisdom saving throw** or become addicted
- Addicted creatures will do everything in their power to enter the pool and drink until they drown
- **Crystal Vulnerability:** All who drink (even if they save vs addiction) have disadvantage on saves against red crystal mind control

**Curing the Addiction:**
- **Kethrin's Daily Ritual:** Suppresses addiction for 24 hours (prevents compulsive behavior, must be recast daily)
- **Kethrin's Week-Long Ritual:** Permanently cures addiction (requires staying with tribe for 7 days)
- **Remove Curse** or **Greater Restoration:** Immediately cures addiction (if cast by others)
- The Mistfallen will offer the cure in exchange for aid with their problems

**Potential Boon: The Waters of Healing**
A single draught of water from Garrek's Falls will:
- Regrow lost limbs
- Restore all lost hit points
- Cure any mundane disease
- **Raise a creature from death** if they have been dead for less than 72 hours

**The Price:** Risk of addiction (DC 12 Wisdom save) and permanent crystal vulnerability

### Peaceful Resolution Path

**Stage 1: Observation (Approach)**
- Darva and scouts observe party from the moment they destroy the cave crystal
- Positive signs: Freed dragon, investigated before acting, showed mercy to controlled creatures
- Report to Kethrin about party's character

**Stage 2: The Test (At the Falls)**
- Party reaches Garrek's Falls
- Do they drink immediately or investigate first?
- Do they notice the skeletal remains (DC 20 Perception)?
- Do they show restraint despite incredible power offered?

**Stage 3: Contact (Introduction)**
- If party shows wisdom, Kethrin approaches under flag of truce with Darva as security
- Opening: *"You broke the guardian crystal, yet the dragon lives. Few surface-dwellers show such restraint. I am Kethrin, elder of the Mistfallen. Will you speak with us?"*

**Stage 4: Negotiation (Alliance Formation)**
- Kethrin explains tribe's purpose: *"We guard what must not be lost, yet must not be taken lightly."*
- Offers addiction cure (1 week) in exchange for help with their problems
- Finn acts as friendly interpreter, bridges cultural gaps with enthusiasm
- Morvek presents harsh reality: *"Every week I put down another creature that couldn't resist."*

**Stage 5: Alliance (Ongoing Benefits)**
- Party helps with Underdark problems during cure week
- Final task: Return to Agastia for Mistfallen mission (reason TBD)
- Ongoing benefits: Limited water access (for true emergencies), Underdark info, safe passage, Finn as guide

### Adventure Design Notes

**Encounter Balance (Level 3 Party):**
- Journey encounters are CR 1/2 to CR 2 creatures (see encounter table)
- Social encounter with Mistfallen is primary resolution
- Combat only if party acts with malice
- Week-long alliance provides downtime for character development

**Pacing Suggestions:**
- 4-6 encounters between cave (dragon guardian) and Falls (8-12 hours travel)
- First sight of Falls should be moment of awe (emphasize beauty, scent, atmosphere)
- Give players time to investigate before Mistfallen make contact
- Don't rush the negotiation - this is key faction relationship moment

**Player Agency:**
- Drinking the water is entirely player choice (don't force it)
- Multiple paths to alliance (cure request, genuine help, shared enemy)
- Week-long commitment is significant - make sure players understand stakes
- Mistfallen mission to Agastia ties Underdark content back to main campaign

**Future Development:**
- Week-long quest content via point-crawl (track as separate todo)
- Lyria connection in Agastia (red hair, freckles = recognition moment)
- Chaos Cult corruption as ongoing campaign threat
- Crystal technology as potential campaign resource
