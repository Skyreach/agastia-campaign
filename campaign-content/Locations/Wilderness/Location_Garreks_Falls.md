# Garrek's Falls

## Player Summary

**Garrek's Falls**, named after the deep gnome explorer who discovered it nearly 170 years ago, is well-known by historians and healers throughout the underground realms, though they do their very best to keep its location a secret. Though the water has incredible healing properties, what can heal can also harm. The water of Garrek's Falls is one of the most addictive substances on the planet, and those who use it have a tendency to crave more and more. Growing ever more rabid in their desire for the healing waters, they become violent and eventually lose themselves to the need.

### Overview
- **Type:** Underground waterfall and pool
- **Location:** Deep Underdark, protected by Mistfallen tribe
- **Age:** Ancient (predates discovery by 170 years)
- **Fame:** Known to scholars and healers (location kept secret)
- **Danger Level:** Extreme (addictive properties)
- **Guardian:** Mistfallen tribe (protective isolationists)

## Description

> The sound of rushing water draws you into a cavern illuminated by flashing streaks of red light that play among gravity-defying streams of water. Fed by the roaring torrent crashing through a hole in the ceiling of the cavern, a crystalline pool below beckons you with the sweet scent of lavender and honey. Flashes of crimson light briefly illuminate the depths of the pool, revealing a glimmering bottom of white sand.

**Visual Elements:**
- Gravity-defying water streams (magical phenomenon)
- Flashing red lights (reflections from ceiling crystals - see DM Notes)
- Crystalline pool with white sand bottom
- Waterfall from ceiling opening
- Sweet scent of lavender and honey

**Atmosphere:**
- Beautiful and beckoning
- Otherworldly and ethereal
- Deceptively peaceful
- Bones visible at bottom (DC 20 Perception)

## Mechanics

### Healing Aura
As soon as a creature enters this cavern, it continually benefits from the effects of the **Lesser Restoration** spell. A DC 14 Intelligence (Medicine) check will connect this occurrence with the moisture in the air, which appears to carry some kind of enchantment.

### Skeletal Remains
A DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check will reveal skeletal remains in the white sand at the bottom of the pool - victims of the water's addictive curse who drowned while seeking "just one more sip."

## Key Dangers

### Just One Sip
The most significant danger associated with this location is also its greatest treasure. The water of Garrek's Falls is **highly addictive**.

**Addiction Mechanic:**
- Any creature that consumes the water must make a **DC 12 Wisdom saving throw** or fall prey to its addictive qualities
- From that moment on, it will do everything in its power to enter the pool and consume the liquid until it drowns
- **Crystal Vulnerability:** Those who have consumed the water (even once) have disadvantage on saving throws against mind control effects from the red crystals found in nearby caves

**Curing the Addiction:**
- **Mistfallen Shaman's Daily Ritual:** Suppresses addiction for 24 hours (prevents compulsive behavior, must be recast daily)
- **Mistfallen Shaman's Week-Long Ritual:** Permanently cures addiction (requires staying with tribe for 7 days)
- **Remove Curse** or **Greater Restoration:** Immediately cures addiction (if cast by others)
- The Mistfallen will offer the cure in exchange for aid with their problems

## Potential Loot or Boons

### The Waters of Healing
A single draught of water from Garrek's Falls will:
- Regrow lost limbs
- Restore all lost hit points
- Cure any mundane disease
- **Raise a creature from death** if they have been dead for less than 72 hours

**The Price:** The addictive curse (DC 12 Wisdom save to resist)

## DM Notes

### Connection to Campaign Lore

**Crystal Connection:**
The "flashing red lights" in the pool are reflections from **glowing red crystals** embedded in the cavern ceiling. These crystals are the same type used by the Mistfallen tribe to control creatures in the cave network the party passed through.

**The Entity's Motivation (Cave Controller):**
The mind-controlling entity in the caves is **Kethrin**, the Mistfallen elder and shaman, who uses the red crystals to:
1. **Protect the Falls** from outsiders who would exploit or be destroyed by the water
2. **Mercy-kill those already addicted** by directing creatures to "herd" addicts into controlled areas where they can be put down humanely
3. **Observe worthy visitors** - The Mistfallen watch how visitors handle challenges. Those who show wisdom, restraint, and mercy (like freeing the dragon) prove themselves worthy of contact

**Why Spiders Were Herding:**
- Addicts and crystal-vulnerable creatures were being funneled to the "old hollow" (Corrupted Grove from Ghost of Elaris quest)
- The Mistfallen were trying to contain them before they reached the Falls
- Elaris died because they were caught in a herding pattern meant for someone/something else

### The Mistfallen Tribe

**See:** `campaign-content/Factions/Faction_Mistfallen_Tribe.md` for complete faction details and NPC descriptions.

**Quick Reference:**
- **Tone:** Protective isolationists
- **Key NPCs:** Kethrin (elder/shaman), Darva (scout leader), Finn (young artisan), Morvek (caretaker)
- **Distinctive Trait:** Bright red hair and geometric freckle patterns
- **What They Want:** Keep Falls secret, deal with Chaos Cult corruption, find trustworthy allies

**Peaceful Resolution Path:**
1. Mistfallen scouts (led by Darva) observe party after crystal destruction
2. They watch how party handles arriving at the Falls - restraint or greed?
3. If party shows wisdom, Kethrin approaches under flag of truce
4. Negotiation: Tribe offers addiction cure (1 week) in exchange for help
5. Alliance: Party helps with Underdark problems, final task connects to Agastia

### Adventure Hooks

**Session 4 Opening:**
- Green dragon (now freed from control) can guide party to Falls
- Dragon warns them about the water's danger
- Mistfallen scouts shadow the party, testing their intentions

**Potential Conflicts:**
- Party member drinks the water and becomes addicted
- Chaos Cult forces trying to control/corrupt the Falls

**Connections to Other Quests:**

- **Chaos Cult:** Corruption from "old hollow" threatening the Falls' purity
- **Josh's Backstory:** When ready, the water could be tied to his markings/origin
