# The Grand Cathedral

## Overview

**Type & Specialty:** Divine magic center and interfaith temple - powerful healing, restoration, resurrection, and divination services from high-level clerics representing all recognized faiths

**Location:** [[Research Quarter]] (Tier 2-3), prominent position on temple plaza near district center

**Clientele:** Wealthy patrons, adventurers needing resurrection, nobles requiring restoration, factions seeking neutral meeting ground, emergency cases subsidized by donations

**Reputation:** "Where life returns and curses break." The most powerful divine magic available in [[Agastia]], trusted by all factions as politically neutral ground. If healing magic can save you, the Cathedral can provide it.

**Atmosphere:** Grand architecture blending symbols from multiple faiths. Healing chambers with soft light and peaceful incense. Main sanctuary shows religious harmony - altars to different deities arranged in circle of equals. Professional clerics move quietly between private consultation rooms. Air carries sense of sacred peace despite constant activity.

## Proprietor

**Cardinal Theron Lightbringer** - Human male, late 40s, former adventuring paladin (Retired Paladin 12th level)

**Personality:**
- Pragmatic idealist - believes in interfaith cooperation while understanding political realities
- Patient diplomat - manages competing religious factions with calm authority
- Combat veteran - understands violence's cost, prefers healing to warfare
- Principled neutral - provides healing regardless of faction, creating complicated situations

**Appearance:** Tall, broad-shouldered build showing years of armor wear. Short gray-streaked brown hair. Formal cardinal's robes in neutral white and gold, eschewing any single deity's colors. Calloused hands from adventuring days. Wears simple holy symbol combining multiple faith icons. Warm but weary expression - someone who's seen too much suffering.

**Motivation:** Concerned that Cathedral's resources increasingly fund combat preparation (healing adventurers between fights) rather than community healing and spiritual service. Believes the merit system's focus on combat achievement pulls divine magic away from its true purpose. Maintains Cathedral's neutrality even when pressured by Council or factions.

**Quest Hook - The Shifting Balance:**
- **Need:** Theron notices troubling pattern - Cathedral's high-level healing goes overwhelmingly to adventurers and soldiers, while common citizens rely on lower-tier temples for basic care. Wealthy patrons subsidize resurrection services for their agents while the poor die from preventable diseases.
- **Problem:** Theron wants to shift resources toward community healing without abandoning those fighting genuine threats. He needs someone to investigate whether current adventuring groups genuinely serve public good or simply pursue personal glory. If the latter, he'll redirect Cathedral resources to actual community needs.
- **Reward:** In exchange for honest assessment and helping identify worthy causes:
  - 30% discount on all Cathedral services permanently
  - Priority healing access (skip waiting lists for urgent cases)
  - Introductions to other high-ranking clergy across multiple faiths
  - Access to divination services for moral guidance (not treasure hunting)
  - Emergency resurrection at cost (no profit margin) if party serves true need
- **Difficulty:** Moderate to High - Requires investigating adventuring groups, understanding their motivations, making moral judgments. May create enemies among those profiting from current system. Theron expects honesty even if it reflects poorly on party.

## DM Notes

**Plot Hooks:**

1. **The Combat Chaplain Dilemma:** Theron notices adventuring parties use Cathedral as healing station between increasingly questionable expeditions. He hires party to investigate whether other "adventurers" actually serve public good or pursue personal profit. Results determine whether Cathedral continues supporting them or redirects resources.

2. **Interfaith Crisis:** Secret document surfaces claiming one faith's primacy over others. Factions pressure Theron to take sides. He needs trusted party to investigate document's origin, determine authenticity, and resolve situation without destroying interfaith cooperation.

3. **The Resurrection Trade:** Someone's selling pre-paid resurrection agreements to criminals and chaos cultists. Cathedral's strict neutrality means they honor contracts regardless of customer. Theron needs party to find who's selling agreements and stop them without compromising Cathedral's sacred commitments.

4. **Divine Silence:** Multiple senior clerics report their deities not responding to commune spells. Either divine communication is being blocked, or deities are withdrawing for unknown reason. Theron needs investigation into whether this is magical interference or divine judgment.

5. **The Subsidy Scheme:** Wealthy patron donates substantial funds specifically for community healing. Months later, pattern emerges - only patients from one faction's territory receive subsidized care. Someone's using charitable donations for political manipulation.

**Personality Quirks:**
- Insists on personally greeting resurrection clients - knows how traumatic death and return can be
- Maintains small shrine to fallen adventuring companions in private chamber
- Still wears old adventuring boots under formal robes ("Never forget where you came from")
- Mediates faction disputes with patience of saint, then retreats to private chapel to decompress
- Refuses to eat until day's emergency cases are resolved (staff keeps food warm)
- Knows obscure prayers and rites from dozens of faiths (valuable for unusual situations)

**Connection to Campaigns:**
- Essential service for any campaign with character death risk
- Neutral ground enables cross-faction party cooperation
- Theron can provide moral guidance without preaching
- Cathedral's resources make it target for heists or manipulation
- Interfaith model shows merit system's complexity
- Combat vs. community healing tension reflects broader campaign themes

**Secret Complications:**
- Theron secretly maintains list of those resurrected, tracking how they use second chance
- Some senior clerics disagree with Theron's neutrality - believe Cathedral should oppose chaos cult more actively
- Cathedral sitting on massive donation reserves, creating internal debate about proper use
- Theron's former adventuring party included member who became chaos cultist - shapes his views on moral complexity
- Several faction leaders have pre-paid resurrection agreements - Cathedral must resurrect them even if they die committing atrocities

**Mechanical Importance:**
- Only reliable resurrection source prevents character death from ending campaigns
- High-level divine magic access unavailable elsewhere in city
- Fast service prevents adventure delays
- Political neutrality enables cross-faction storylines
- Theron's quest hooks encourage party moral development

**Using the Cathedral:**
- Don't make resurrection trivial - maintain drama and cost
- Use neutral ground function for faction negotiations
- Theron can provide moral compass without being preachy
- Interfaith dynamics add depth to religious characters
- Cathedral's wealth and influence make it plot factor beyond healing services
- Balance "healing vending machine" with meaningful institution
