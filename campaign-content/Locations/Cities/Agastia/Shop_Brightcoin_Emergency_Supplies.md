# Brightcoin Emergency Supplies

## Overview

**Location:** [[Merchant District]] (Tier 4), strategically positioned near district's main gate leading to outer city

**Clientele:** Adventurers, travelers, merchants needing last-minute supplies, those seeking discreet information

**Reputation:** "Marcus always has what you need - even before you know you need it." Known for uncanny ability to stock exactly the right items and possess surprisingly useful information.

**Atmosphere:** Organized but dense. Every wall covered with hanging equipment, shelves packed with supplies, barrels of dry goods. Feels like walking into a perfectly curated catalog. Smell of leather, oil, dried herbs, and paper. Front area is standard shop; back room (visible through bead curtain) suggests more interesting inventory.

## DM Notes

### Plot Hooks

**The Missing Informant:**
- One of Marcus's key information sources disappeared
- Either captured, killed, or turned by rival faction
- Needs recovery or confirmation of fate
- Information they possessed dangerous if revealed
- Reward: Major favor from Marcus (valuable given his network), 500gp, priority information access
- Difficulty: Moderate (investigation, possible combat, faction politics)

**The Competing Information Broker:**
- New intelligence service undercutting Marcus's prices
- Either legitimate competition or front for faction's intelligence operation
- If faction-backed, threatens Marcus's neutrality (forces him to choose sides)
- Needs investigation of competitor's backers and methods
- Reward: Permanent 25% discount on information, introduction to Marcus's highest-level contacts, partnership offer
- Difficulty: Moderate-High (investigation, possible faction confrontation)

**The Dangerous Knowledge:**
- Marcus acquired information too sensitive to sell or keep safely
- Multiple factions would kill to obtain or suppress it
- Needs trusted agents to either secure it somewhere safe or use it to defuse situation
- Possession of knowledge endangers everyone who knows it
- Reward: Significant payment (2,000gp+), major faction favor, or incredibly valuable counter-intelligence
- Difficulty: High (multiple factions involved, extreme danger)

**The Party's Starting Equipment:**
- Marcus "randomly" stocked exactly what party needed for first adventure
- How did he know? Investigating reveals he received anonymous tip
- Tip came from someone with precognition or deep insider knowledge
- Following this thread reveals larger conspiracy
- Reward: Understanding of forces manipulating events, potential ally revelation
- Difficulty: Variable (depends on who sent tip and why)

### Personality Quirks

- Never asks direct questions - lets people volunteer information
- Keeps small notebook, makes cryptic notes during conversations
- Offers tea during consultations (excellent listener, poor tea)
- Refers to information as "inventory" and "stock" (discusses it like merchandise)
- Never confirms or denies specific knowledge - implies without stating
- Remembers every purchase anyone makes (uses for profiling and predictions)
- Maintains perfect poker face except rare genuine smile for trusted friends

### Secret Information

**The True Business Model:**
- Shop breaks even or slight loss
- Real profit from information brokering (10x merchandise income)
- Uses shop as cover and recruitment source for informant network
- Every customer potentially becomes information asset
- Legitimate business provides plausible deniability

**The Network:**
- 50+ active informants throughout [[Agastia]] (all tiers)
- Includes: Servants in noble houses, dock workers, council clerks, temple acolytes, criminals
- Marcus never reveals sources (absolute confidentiality maintains network)
- Compartmentalized - informants don't know each other
- Some informants don't realize they're providing intelligence (casual conversations Marcus mines)

**The Insurance Files:**
- Hidden archives contain blackmail material on important figures
- Not actively used for extortion (would destroy neutral reputation)
- Insurance against being silenced or eliminated
- Dead man's switch: Files release if Marcus dies suspiciously
- Several factions aware of files' existence (deters violence against him)

**The [[Chaos Cult]] Problem:**
- Marcus suspects cult infiltration but can't confirm
- Some information he's sold likely aided cult operations (unknowingly)
- Wrestling with moral implications of neutral stance
- If party trustworthy, might recruit them to investigate his own network
- Fears discovering he's compromised, but needs to know

**Personal History:**
- "Brightcoin" not his birth name (changed it for merchant career)
- Original background more interesting than claims
- Possibly noble-born fallen from status (would explain connections and education)
- Or former spy/intelligence agent (would explain skills and network)
- Carefully guards true history (vulnerability if revealed)

### Integration with Campaign

**Immediate Utility:**
- Party already knows Marcus (bought starting equipment from him)
- Comfortable returning for resupply
- Natural introduction to information brokering
- Can provide rumors, hooks, quest leads

**Progressive Relationship:**
- Initially: Helpful merchant who seems oddly informed
- Early partnership: Realizes party useful for information gathering
- Established: Shares intelligence, involves in sensitive operations
- Deep trust: Reveals aspects of network, true scope of knowledge
- Crisis: Party must protect Marcus or his network from threat

**Information Economy:**
- Party can sell information to Marcus (payment or credit)
- Marcus trades information for party's services
- Creates two-way relationship beyond merchant/customer
- Party becomes part of network (valuable but potentially compromising)

**Faction Complexity:**
- Marcus's neutrality creates tension - factions pressure him
- Party's relationship with Marcus affects faction standing
- Being seen entering back room signals involvement in intelligence world
- Other factions may try using party to spy on or compromise Marcus

**[[Chaos Cult]] Revelation:**
- Eventually discovering Marcus unknowingly aided cult
- How does he react? Maintains neutrality or takes sides?
- Party can help him identify cult infiltration in network
- His information assets valuable in anti-cult operations
- But using them abandons neutrality (existential crisis for character)

**The Emergency Kit Prophecy:**
- Marcus's "lucky guesses" about needed supplies too accurate
- Either he has precognitive source or is receiving tips from time-traveler/diviner
- Investigation reveals he's pawn in larger game
- Or: He's more than he appears (secret diviner? Subtle mind-reader?)
- Truth adds layer to character, campaign mysteries
