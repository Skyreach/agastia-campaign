# Tidecaller Armory

## Overview

**Type & Specialty:** Maritime weapons, salvaged armor, and waterproofing services - specialized combat gear for seafaring life and those who can't afford pristine equipment

**Location:** [[Dock District]] (Tier 6), near the waterfront between [[Saltwind General Supply]] and The Rusty Anchor Tavern

**Clientele:** Dock workers, ship guards, salvage crews, bounty hunters, fallen mercenaries, anyone needing weapons on a tight budget

**Reputation:** "Your weapon won't look pretty, but it'll work when you need it." Known for maritime specialization, no-questions-asked sales, and a proprietor who understands violence's realities.

**Atmosphere:** Salty, industrial, functional. Weapons hang from walls on salvaged ship hooks. Armor stands display pieces scarred by combat and sea spray. Smell of oil, rust remover, and brine. Cramped but organized - everything has its place. Workbench in back covered in repair projects. No pretense, no decoration, just tools for survival.

## Proprietor

**"Iron Tooth" Margret** - Half-orc female, mid-40s, former mercenary (Veteran Fighter)

**Personality:**
- Blunt and direct - no time for bullshit or posturing
- Principled beneath the rough exterior - has lines she won't cross
- Bitter about the merit system but channels it into helping others
- Respects those who stand up for what's right, even at personal cost

**Appearance:** Powerfully built with graying black hair in a practical braid. Her namesake "iron tooth" is a steel replacement for one she lost in combat, visible when she speaks. Scarred knuckles, calloused hands. Wears practical dock worker clothes - reinforced canvas, heavy boots, leather apron. Left forearm has a distinctive mercenary company brand she no longer talks about.

**Motivation:** Once a respected mercenary sergeant, Margret was dishonorably discharged after refusing an order to burn a village she knew held only civilians. She chose principles over status. Now she arms those the city overlooks and watches for chances to expose the corruption that validates atrocities while punishing honor.

**Quest Hook - The Corruption Records:**
- **Need:** Margret has been quietly investigating the mercenary company that destroyed her career. She's learned they falsified mission reports to cover war crimes, with [[Merit Council]] oversight turning a blind eye in exchange for kickbacks.
- **Problem:** She's traced evidence to a specific Council clerk who maintains duplicate ledgers. The real records would expose both the mercenary company and complicit Council members, but they're kept in the Civic Archives under guard.
- **Reward:** In exchange for securing copies of the genuine records:
  - 25% permanent discount on all weapons and armor
  - Access to black market weapon sources (normally restricted items)
  - Training in maritime combat techniques (+1 proficiency bonus with harpoons, boarding axes, nets)
  - Introduction to network of fallen-but-principled fighters (potential allies/hirelings)
  - Her testimony if party ever needs to expose Council corruption
- **Difficulty:** Moderate to High - Requires stealth or social engineering to access Civic Archives, identifying correct records, avoiding guards, and protecting Margret from retaliation once evidence goes public.

## DM Notes

**Plot Hooks:**

- Margret's intelligence network reveals dock district plots and dangers
- Self-defense training sessions could be targeted by those seeking to suppress organization

- Refuses to sell to obvious chaos cultists or those seeking weapons for atrocities
- Drinks with dock workers at Rusty Anchor but stays sober enough to fight if needed
- Has recurring nightmare about the village she refused to burn (wakes early, starts work)
- Subtly investigates new customers with military bearing (looking for former company members)

**Connection to Campaigns:**

- Margret's network provides dock district contacts and information
- Black market services enable morally ambiguous play options

**Combat Stats (If Needed):**
- **"Iron Tooth" Margret:** Use Veteran stat block (MM p.350)
- Modifications: Add Battlemaster Fighter maneuvers (Disarming Attack, Menacing Attack, Trip Attack)
- Equipment: +1 battleaxe (personal weapon, not for sale), chain mail, shield
- Tactics: Defensive, protects shop and customers, focuses on disabling rather than killing unless provoked

**Secret:** Margret maintains hidden cache of evidence against her former mercenary company - maps of destroyed villages, survivor testimonies, contradictory mission reports. She's waiting for the right moment and allies to expose it without getting killed. The party could be those allies.

**Salvage Quality Note:** When players purchase salvaged armor, DM can optionally roll for hidden flaws (10% chance). Flaws are cosmetic or minor (broken strap, loose buckle) and fixable with DC 10 check and 1 hour, but add realism to "damaged goods" theme. Margret will repair flaws for free if pointed out - she tests equipment but occasionally something slips through.

**Training Roleplay:** Margret's self-defense classes teach practical, brutal techniques - eye gouges, throat strikes, groin kicks. She doesn't teach honor or sportsmanship, she teaches survival. Players observing or participating see the difference between her "keep dock workers alive" approach and formal martial training.

**Blacklist:** Margret maintains mental list of people she won't sell to:
- Known chaos cultists (recognizes symbols, behavioral patterns)
- Mercenaries from companies with atrocity records
- Press gang operators (she arms dock workers against them)
- Anyone seeking weapons explicitly to victimize the vulnerable
- If players trigger blacklist behavior, Margret refuses service permanently unless they make extraordinary amends.

**Waterproofing Details:** The waterproofing treatment involves coating weapons/armor in rendered seal fat mixed with pine tar and beeswax. Smells distinctive (other NPCs may comment on "fish oil smell"). Prevents rust and water damage but requires reapplication every 1d6 months. Players might forget and face rusty weapons after extended sea travel if they don't track duration.

**Moral Complexity:** Margret fences stolen goods and sells weapons no-questions-asked, which enables crime. But she won't facilitate violence against the innocent. Players can explore tension between "black market arms dealer" and "principled veteran who lost everything for refusing atrocity." She's not lawful good, but she has lines.
