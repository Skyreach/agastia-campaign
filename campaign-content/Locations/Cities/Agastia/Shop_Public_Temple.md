# The House of Many Faiths

## Overview

**Type & Specialty:** Public temple offering accessible divine healing, prayer services, and spiritual guidance - a community sanctuary representing multiple faiths under one roof

**Location:** [[Scholar Quarter]] (Tier 4), near the district border with [[Merchant District]], on Temple Plaza alongside smaller faith shrines

**Clientele:** Common folk, adventurers, scholars, those seeking spiritual guidance, people in need of healing who cannot afford the Grand Cathedral

**Reputation:** "Where the gods meet the people." Known as the spiritual heart of the common folk - less grand than the Cathedral but infinitely more accessible. Respected for genuine care and community service.

**Atmosphere:** Warm and welcoming. The main hall features alcoves dedicated to different deities - each with its own altar, iconography, and offerings. Incense mingles with candle smoke. Quiet prayers echo off stone walls. Always smells of beeswax, sage, and fresh bread (from daily charity distribution). Peaceful but alive with community activity.

## Proprietor

**Brother Aldric Threepath** - Human male, late 40s, multi-faith cleric (Life Domain, 9th level)

**Personality:**
- Warm and inclusive - believes all genuine faiths lead to truth
- Practical spirituality - gods are proven through service, not sermons
- Stubborn defender of sanctuary rights - will not yield temple protection
- Gentle with the suffering, fierce with oppressors

**Appearance:** Medium build, weathered face with laugh lines, graying brown hair tied back, simple multi-colored robe representing various faiths (blue, gold, green, silver threads). Calloused hands from volunteer work. Always wears a chain with three holy symbols: sunburst (Pelor/light), scales (justice), and open hand (mercy).

**Motivation:** Saw too many people turned away from temples for lack of coin. Founded the House of Many Faiths to serve everyone regardless of wealth or specific religious allegiance. Believes the divine is proven through compassion, not dogma.

**Background:** Former adventuring cleric who traveled with diverse party - learned to respect all faiths. Used adventuring wealth to establish this temple 15 years ago. Now trains young clerics in practical service.

**Quest Hook - The Stolen Charity:**
- **Need:** Someone is stealing from the temple's charity fund - not the main temple treasury, but specifically the coins meant for the poorest citizens. Brother Aldric is heartbroken; the thief must know what they're taking.
- **Problem:** The thief seems to know the temple's layout and schedule. Aldric suspects an insider but refuses to accuse his clerics without proof. Meanwhile, families who depend on temple charity are going hungry.
- **Twist:** The thief is a young acolyte stealing to pay off a debt to local criminals who threatened their family. The criminals know about temple security and are exploiting the acolyte's knowledge.
- **Reward:** In exchange for resolving this without violence:
  - Permanent 50% discount on all temple healing services
  - Free prayer services and blessings (no time limit)
  - Divine inspiration: Brother Aldric will cast *Augury* once per week for the party (free)
  - Temple sanctuary - can claim protection from legal pursuit (within reason)
  - Access to temple's hidden reliquary (minor holy items, historical texts)
  - Introduction to Temple Council (connections to other faiths across Agastia)
- **Difficulty:** Moderate - Requires investigation, discretion, and possibly confronting criminals without causing harm to the acolyte's family.

- One of the alcoves contains a dormant artifact sacred to an ancient, nearly forgotten deity
- Aldric's adventuring past includes a dark moment he atoned for by founding this temple
- The multi-faith approach is partly personal (he's not sure which deity answered his prayers during his crisis)
