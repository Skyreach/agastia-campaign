# Shadow's Edge Armory

## Overview

**Type & Specialty:** Black market weapons dealer - illegal arms, improvised weapons, and stolen military equipment for those who can't get weapons through legal channels

**Location:** [[The Depths]] (Tier 7), shifting location in underground tunnels - you need to know someone to find it

**Clientele:** [[Dispossessed]] preparing for resistance, criminals, desperate people who need protection, those planning illegal activities

**Reputation:** "When the law won't protect you, Scar will arm you." Known as dangerous necessity - buying here is a crime, but sometimes it's the only option for survival.

**Atmosphere:** Tension and paranoia. Dim lamplight in cramped tunnel space. Weapons displayed on rough wooden racks or hanging from walls. Smells of gun oil, rust, and damp stone. Always feels like you're about to get caught. Scar watches everyone with military wariness, hand never far from concealed blade.

## Proprietor

**"Scar" (Real Name: Former Captain Darius Stone)** - Human male, late 30s, discharged military officer (Veteran Fighter)

**Personality:**
- Intense and bitter - the system betrayed him and he won't forgive it
- Ideologically driven - believes violent revolution is necessary and coming
- Protective of his people - trains [[Dispossessed]] because they deserve to fight back
- Dangerously vulnerable to manipulation - chaos cult could easily frame their goals as "true revolution"

**Appearance:** Tall, muscular build maintained through constant training. Jagged scar runs from left temple to jaw (origin of nickname). Short-cropped dark hair going gray. Wears practical dark clothing, always armed. Military bearing despite years underground. Cold, calculating eyes that miss nothing.

**Motivation:** Overthrow the merit system through armed uprising. Was betrayed when he refused illegal order and threatened to expose corruption - stripped of rank, status, and honor. Now believes the entire system is fundamentally broken and only violence can fix it. Stockpiles weapons, trains fighters, waits for the moment to strike.

**Quest Hook - The Corruption Evidence:**
- **Need:** Scar has evidence of the military corruption that destroyed his career - orders to massacre civilians, forged reports, command officers covering up war crimes. He wants it delivered to someone who can actually use it.
- **Problem:** Evidence is detailed, documented, and explosive. Council would destroy it if they found it. Scar doesn't trust newspapers or reformers - thinks they'll be silenced or bought off. He needs someone with power who can't be intimidated.
- **Reward:** In exchange for delivering evidence to the right person (and proving it's being used):
  - Access to the Resistance Cache (military-grade equipment)
  - Training in combat tactics (+1 to attack rolls for one combat encounter, once per week)
  - Intelligence network among [[Dispossessed]] (rumors, guard patrol information)
  - Weapons at cost (no markup)
  - Warning if authorities are coming for the party
- **Difficulty:** Hard - Finding trustworthy recipient for evidence is challenging. Council will hunt anyone who has it. Scar may be walking party into trap if evidence exposes wrong people. Chaos cult wants this evidence to weaponize for recruitment.

## Day-to-Day Operations

**Hours:**
- Irregular (varies by day): Scar moves location to avoid detection
- Must know current location through network contacts

## DM Notes

**Plot Hooks:**
- Source for illegal weapons if party needs them
- Contact point for [[Dispossessed]] resistance movement
- Quest giver for corruption evidence delivery
- Potential ally against chaos cult (if he learns they're manipulating him)
- Tragic figure whose justified anger could lead to disaster
- Training provider for combat skills
- Information source about Depths politics and guard activities

**Personality Quirks:**
- Stands at military attention unconsciously when thinking
- Refers to customers by rank assessments ("soldier," "civilian," "liability")
- Tests everyone's commitment with challenging questions about the system
- Has detailed maps of [[Agastia]]'s military installations (obsessive planning)
- Won't sell to anyone who seems like Council plant or chaos cultist (but could be fooled)
- Refuses to profit from revolution - prices at cost for [[Dispossessed]] fighters
- Keeps evidence of corruption in waterproof case on his person at all times

**Connection to Campaigns:**
- Represents legitimate resistance to unjust system
- Could be manipulated by chaos cult to start doomed uprising
- Corruption evidence could be major political plot device
- Training services provide mechanical benefit to party
- Moral complexity: his anger is justified, his methods are dangerous
- Shopping here should feel genuinely risky (being caught = crime)

**Moral Complexity:**
Scar is neither villain nor hero. The system genuinely wronged him - he was punished for refusing to commit atrocities. His anger at corruption is justified. His analysis that the merit system protects the powerful while exploiting the weak has merit. But his belief that only violent revolution can fix things is both dangerous and likely wrong. An uprising would fail and give Council excuse for brutal crackdown. Chaos cult will try to weaponize his justified rage for their purposes.

Party must decide: Is Scar's revolution necessary? Heroic? Doomed? Should they help, hinder, or redirect his energy toward reform instead? Can someone this betrayed by the system ever trust peaceful change? What happens to justified anger when the peaceful path seems blocked?

**[[Chaos Cult]] Vulnerability:**
Scar is EXTREMELY vulnerable to chaos cult manipulation:
- Believes system is fundamentally broken (aligns with chaos message)
- Wants violent overthrow (chaos loves destabilization)
- Trains fighters (potential chaos cult recruits)
- Stockpiles weapons (resources chaos cult can use)
- Distrusts all authority (makes him easier to isolate)
- Has legitimate grievances (chaos can frame itself as ally)

Chaos cult will try to:
- Supply him with chaos-touched weapons (without revealing source)
- Encourage him to accelerate uprising timeline
- Plant cultists among his trainees
- Frame their goals as "true freedom from tyranny"
- Use his corruption evidence to destabilize city at convenient moment
- Transform his justified revolution into chaos-fueled massacre

If party befriends Scar, warning him about chaos cult becomes critical mission.
