# Mistfallen Tribe

## Player Summary

The **Mistfallen Tribe** is a small, isolated community in the deep Underdark who guard Garrek's Falls and its dangerous healing waters. Descendants of deep gnomes and drow exiles, they use crystal magic to protect their sacred site from outsiders and contain those driven mad by the water's addictive properties.

All Mistfallen share distinctive features: bright red hair (vivid, unnatural red not found in surface populations) and geometric freckle patterns across their faces, shoulders, and hands. Pure Mistfallen display dense, intricate patterns resembling star constellations, while those of mixed heritage show faded, scattered patterns. They have pale skin adapted to complete darkness and eyes that reflect red light like the crystals they use.

The tribe are protective isolationists who view themselves as guardians of a terrible blessing. While suspicious of outsiders, they will negotiate with those who prove wisdom and restraint. They are desperate for help dealing with threats their magic can't handle alone.

## DM Notes

### Overview

**Population:** 50-100 individuals
**Location:** Deep Underdark near Garrek's Falls
**Alignment:** Lawful Neutral (protective but not malicious)
**Reputation:** Unknown to most surface dwellers

The Mistfallen Tribe was founded by deep gnomes and drow exiles who discovered Garrek's Falls generations ago. They created a crystal network to protect the sacred site, using harvested red crystals to control creatures and create a defensive perimeter. The tribe views endless vigilance as both their duty and their curse.

**Current Situation:**
Their crystal network is failing due to Chaos Cult corruption spreading from deeper in the Underdark. More addicted creatures are seeking the Falls, overwhelming their containment operations. They desperately need outside help but cannot risk revealing the Falls' location to unworthy visitors.

### Goals & Progress Clocks

**Protect Garrek's Falls** [2/8]
- Keep location secret from surface world
- Prevent exploitation of healing waters
- Current Progress: Crystal network weakening, more outsiders discovering rumors

- Test visitors through observation and challenges
- Current Progress: Party freed dragon (positive sign), awaiting their arrival at Falls

### Operations

**Crystal Network Defense:**
The Mistfallen use harvested red crystals placed throughout their territory to create controlled mind-link with creatures (frogs as scouts, spiders as guards, larger creatures as sentinels). Kethrin controls the network via staff topped with master crystal.

**Herding Protocol:**
Addicted creatures and those vulnerable to crystal control are funneled to the "old hollow" (Corrupted Grove) where they can be contained or mercifully killed. System is designed to prevent them from reaching the Falls.

**Visitor Testing:**
All who approach Falls are observed. Mistfallen watch for wisdom, restraint, and mercy. Those who show these qualities (like freeing controlled creatures rather than killing them) are deemed worthy of contact. Those who act with greed or violence are driven away or eliminated.

**Cure Rituals:**
Only Kethrin can perform addiction cure rituals. Daily ritual (24-hour suppression) requires 1 hour and expenditure of 1st-level spell slot. Week-long ritual (permanent cure) requires continuous attention and special crystal focus.

### Relationships

**Allies:**
- None currently (isolated)
- Potential: Party (if alliance formed during Session 4)

**Enemies:**
- **Chaos Cult:** Actively corrupting their crystal network from deeper Underdark
- **Water Seekers:** Various desperate individuals/groups seeking Falls' healing power

**Neutral:**
- **Underdark Denizens:** Avoid tribe territory due to crystal guardians
- **Surface World:** Unknown to most, prefer to keep it that way

**Complicated:**
- **Lyria (in Agastia):** Connection TBD - possible descendant, exile, or agent

### Future Hooks

**The Lyria Connection:**
When party meets Lyria in Agastia, they'll recognize her red hair and freckle patterns (faded, indicating mixed heritage). Questions: Did she leave the tribe? Is she their Agastia contact? Does she know about the Falls?

**Chaos Cult Escalation:**
The corruption spreading from deeper Underdark could eventually threaten the Falls itself. Party might need to venture deeper to stop the source.

**Crystal Technology:**
Finn's crystal crafting knowledge could become valuable if party needs crystal-based solutions to other problems. Could he teach them? Would Kethrin allow it?

**Addiction Cure Service:**
If party proves trustworthy, Mistfallen could become a resource for curing addictions (magical or mundane). This could create ongoing relationship and obligations.

**Week-Long Quest:**
Party staying for cure ritual opens up point-crawl exploration of Mistfallen territory and surrounding Underdark. What problems do they discover? What does this reveal about the tribe?

**Agastia Mission:**
Final task that sends party back to surface (reason TBD via point-crawl). This creates ongoing connection between Underdark faction and surface campaign.

### Secrets

**The Burden of Mercy:**
Morvek's "caretaker" role is emotionally destroying him. He personally kills 2-3 addicted creatures per week. He's begun questioning whether the Falls should exist at all - if destroying it would prevent more suffering than it causes healing.

**Finn's Forbidden Research:**
Finn is secretly experimenting with ways to reduce the water's addictive properties. He believes the tribe's isolation isn't sustainable and wants to make the Falls safer. Kethrin doesn't know. If it works, it could change everything. If it fails catastrophically, it could corrupt the Falls.

**Darva's Past:**
Darva was once addicted to the water herself (before joining the tribe). She drank it as a surface dweller seeking a cure for her dying child. The child lived. Darva became addicted. Kethrin's ritual saved her, but she's never forgiven herself for the year she lost to madness. This drives her extreme suspicion of outsiders.

**The Crystal Network is Sentient:**
The master crystal Kethrin uses has developed a rudimentary consciousness from decades of controlling creatures. It whispers to him, suggests targets, sometimes acts without his conscious command. He's terrified of what it's becoming but can't stop using it without losing their primary defense.

**Lyria's True Purpose:**
[To be developed] Lyria is either: (1) an exile sent away as child with mixed heritage, (2) a spy the tribe sent to Agastia generations ago who's gone native, (3) a descendant who doesn't know her origins, or (4) the tribe's planned contact for retrieving something critical from the surface.

### Peaceful Resolution Path

**Stage 1: Observation**
- Darva and scouts observe party after crystal destruction
- Positive signs: Freed dragon, investigated before acting, showed mercy
- Negative signs: Killed needlessly, acted with greed, destroyed protection recklessly

**Stage 2: The Test at the Falls**
- Party reaches Garrek's Falls
- Do they drink immediately or investigate first?
- Do they notice the bones at the bottom?
- Do they show restraint despite the incredible power offered?

**Stage 3: Contact**
- If party shows wisdom, Kethrin approaches under flag of truce
- Darva accompanies as security
- Initial conversation: "You broke the guardian crystal, yet the dragon lives. Will you speak with us?"

**Stage 4: Negotiation**
- Kethrin explains tribe's purpose and current problems
- Offers addiction cure (1 week ritual) in exchange for help
- Finn acts as friendly interpreter, bridges cultural gaps
- Morvek presents harsh realities: "Every week I put down another creature that couldn't resist."

**Stage 5: Alliance**
- Party helps with Underdark problems during cure week (point-crawl content TBD)
- Final task: Return to Agastia to [retrieve/deliver/contact something] for tribe
- Ongoing benefits: Limited water access, Underdark information, safe passage, Finn as guide

**Roleplay Tips:**
- **Kethrin:** Weary but hopeful, speaks slowly, tests through questions not combat
- **Darva:** Short clipped speech, always watching, actions speak louder than words
- **Finn:** Eager and curious, asks about surface world, bridges gaps with enthusiasm
- **Morvek:** Blunt and practical, challenges idealism, respects those who make hard choices

**Encounter Stats Summary:**
- Total fighting force: ~15-25 combatants (5-10 scouts, 10-15 warriors)
- Prefer negotiation over combat
- Will defend Falls to the death if necessary
- Crystal network provides significant defensive advantage on home terrain
