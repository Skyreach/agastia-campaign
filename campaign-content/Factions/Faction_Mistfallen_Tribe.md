The **Mistfallen Tribe** is a small, isolated community in the deep Underdark who guard Garrek's Falls and its dangerous healing waters.

## Faction Goals

### Primary Goals
1. **Protect Garrek's Falls** - Keep location secret, prevent exploitation
2. **Contain the addicted** - Prevent them from reaching the Falls or harming others
3. **Survive in the Underdark** - Maintain their small community against hostile forces

### Current Problems
1. **Crystal network failing** - Chaos Cult corruption spreading from deeper Underdark
2. **Increased addict activity** - More creatures seeking the Falls (why?)
3. **Need outside help** - Problems they can't solve alone (connects to Agastia quest)

### What They Want from the Party
- Trustworthy allies who won't betray the Falls' location
- Help dealing with Chaos Cult corruption
- [Connection to Agastia - to be determined via point-crawl]
- Proof that surface dwellers can show wisdom and restraint

## Peaceful Resolution Path

### Stage 1: Observation
- Darva and scouts observe party after crystal destruction
- They note: Did party free the dragon? Show mercy? Investigate before acting?

### Stage 2: The Test
- Party reaches Garrek's Falls
- Mistfallen watch: Do they drink immediately? Show restraint? Investigate dangers?

### Stage 3: Contact
- If party shows wisdom, Kethrin approaches under flag of truce
- Darva accompanies as security
- Initial conversation establishes intentions

### Stage 4: Negotiation
- Kethrin explains tribe's purpose and problems
- Offers addiction cure (1 week ritual) in exchange for help
- Finn acts as friendly interpreter/cultural bridge
- Morvek presents the harsh realities they face

### Stage 5: Alliance
- Party helps with Underdark problems during the week
- Final task sends them to Agastia (reason TBD)
- Ongoing alliance provides Underdark access, healing water (limited), information

## Connection to Lyria

**Mystery Setup:**
When the party meets **Lyria** in Agastia later, they'll recognize:
- Bright red hair (same vivid shade)
- Freckle patterns (faded/scattered - mixed heritage)
- Possible connection to Mistfallen tribe

**Questions Raised:**
- Is Lyria descended from the Mistfallen?
- Did she leave the tribe, or was she born on the surface?
- Does she know about Garrek's Falls?
- What is her connection to the tribe's Agastia mission?
