# Temporal Bloodline Tribe

## Player Summary

A mysterious tribe dwelling in the Underdark near [[Garrek's Falls]], the **Temporal Bloodline Tribe** are guardians of an ancient sanctuary and the [[Codex of Peace]]. Possessing innate temporal magic abilities passed through their bloodline, they have protected the Falls and its healing waters for generations. They are cautious but not hostile, valuing peaceful approach and respecting those who understand the responsibility of power.

## DM Notes

### Overview
The Temporal Bloodline Tribe is a small, isolated community that has guarded [[Garrek's Falls]] and the [[Codex of Peace]] for centuries. They possess unique temporal magic abilities—manipulating time in limited ways—passed through their bloodline. The tribe values balance, responsibility, and protection of dangerous artifacts from those who would misuse them.

### Key Members
**To Be Developed:**
- Tribe Elder/Leader (temporal magic master)
- Guardian Warriors (defenders of the Falls)
- Temporal Mages (bloodline inheritors)
- Lorekeeper (knows Codex history and purpose)

**Future Development:**
- Create specific NPC files when party encounters tribe
- Determine leader's name and personality
- Define tribe's relationship with Garrek (20 years ago)

### Goals & Values

**Primary Goal: Guardianship**
- Protect [[The Codex]] of Peace from removal/misuse
- Guard the healing waters from exploitation
- Prevent addiction and death from the waters
- Maintain the temporal sanctuary's balance

**Core Values:**
- **Balance:** Temporal power must be used responsibly
- **Guardianship:** Protection is their sacred duty
- **Peace:** The Codex's influence guides their philosophy
- **Caution:** Outsiders are threats until proven otherwise
- **Wisdom:** Power without understanding leads to catastrophe

**Tribe Philosophy:**
> "Time flows. We are its guardians, not its masters. The Codex teaches peace, and we enforce that teaching. Those who seek power for domination will find only stillness. Those who seek knowledge with humility may find understanding."

### Location: [[Garrek's Falls]]

**The Sanctuary:**
- Hidden Underdark location, difficult to reach
- Waterfall with miraculous healing properties
- Temporal anomalies present (time flows strangely)
- [[The Codex]] of Peace bound to stone pedestal
- Zone prevents violence, ill will, evil acts (Codex influence)
- Skeletal remains in pool (addiction victims)

**Healing Aura:**
- Continuous *lesser restoration* effect from moisture
- Removes diseases, poisons, curses passively
- Provided by proximity to sacred waters

**Healing Waters (DANGER):**
- Single draught: Regrows limbs, restores all HP, cures diseases, raises dead (<72hrs)
- **DC 12 Wisdom Save:** On failure, compelled to drink more (will drown trying)
- **Tribe's Role:** Prevent outsiders from drinking, warn of danger
- **Evidence:** Skeletal remains visible (DC 20 Perception)

**[[The Codex]] of Peace:**
- 7 metal pages bound to stone pedestal
- Protected by Temporal Bloodline Tribe
- Zone prevents violence (peace enforcement)
- Removal without keyword → explosion (pages scatter as blue energy)
- **Tribe Will NOT share keyword** (sacred trust)

### Temporal Magic Abilities

**Bloodline Powers (Passed Through Generations):**
- **Haste/Slow (Limited):** Speed up or slow creatures (1-2 targets)
- **Temporal Echo:** See brief glimpses of past events in location
- **Time Stop (Elder Only):** Brief time manipulation (1-2 rounds)
- **Age Resistance:** Tribe members age slowly (150+ year lifespans)
- **Temporal Sense:** Detect temporal anomalies and disturbances
- **Chronal Shift:** Short-range teleportation (time-space slip)

**Not All-Powerful:**
- Cannot reverse major events or deaths
- Cannot travel to distant past/future
- Limited to small-scale time manipulation
- Exhausting to use (2-3 major effects per day)
- Requires concentration and training

**Teaching Potential:**
- May teach [[Nikki]] temporal magic basics (if earned)
- Would recognize her interest/aptitude
- Require proof of responsibility first
- Training takes months/years (not instant)

### Relationship with Garrek

**20 Years Ago:**
- Garrek's party discovered [[Garrek's Falls]]
- Tribe allowed them to study the location
- Warned them about healing water danger
- Torvan became addicted, Garrek dragged him away
- Garrek documented the [[Codex]] (couldn't read it)
- **What happened next?** (DM to determine)
  - Did Garrek die trying to remove Codex?
  - Did he anger the tribe somehow?
  - Was his death unrelated to tribe?
  - Did he die of natural causes later?

**Burned Journal Entry:**
> "...tribe guards it... temporal... don't trust..."

**Possible Interpretations:**
1. "Don't trust removing it" (warning about Codex explosion)
2. "Don't trust tribe's motives" (Garrek misunderstood them)
3. "Don't trust temporal magic" (warning about dangers)

**DM Choice:** Decide whether tribe was involved in Garrek's death

### Tribe Population & Structure

**Population:** ~50-80 individuals
- 10-15 warriors (defenders)
- 5-8 temporal mages (bloodline strong)

### Interaction with Party

**First Contact (Caution):**
- Tribe observes party approaching (temporal sense)

- Questioning: "Why have you come? Who sent you?"
- Assessment: Are they treasure hunters or seekers of knowledge?

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Do they show respect for the sanctuary?
- Do they understand the danger of the waters?
- Are they violent or peaceful?
- What is their purpose (greed vs. genuine quest)?

**Possible Outcomes:**

- Share knowledge about Codex and its purpose
- Warn about removal dangers
- May teach [[Nikki]] temporal magic basics (over time)

- Allow party to study location (not remove artifacts)

**Outcome 2: Hostility (If Party Threatens/Disrespects)**
- Defend sanctuary with lethal force if needed
- Use temporal magic to disable/repel invaders

### Combat Capabilities (If Hostile)

**Temporal Bloodline Warriors (CR 2-3 each):**
- Use haste on themselves (extra attacks)
- Slow spell on enemies (disadvantage, half speed)
- Coordinated tactics (centuries of practice)

**Temporal Mages (CR 4-5 each):**
- Haste/Slow (multiple targets)
- Chronal shift (teleport as bonus action)
- Time Stop (1-2 rounds, once per day)
- Hold Person/Monster

**Note:** Combat should be AVOIDABLE with good roleplay

### Relationship with [[Nikki]]

**Recognition of Aptitude:**
- Tribe may sense [[Nikki]]'s interest in temporal magic
- If approached respectfully, may offer to teach

### Knowledge About [[The Codex]]

**What Tribe Knows:**

- Purpose: Enforce peace in sanctuary zone
- 7 pages represent 7 principles of peace
- Removal without keyword causes explosion
- Pages scatter as blue energy if removed improperly
- Each page must be recovered separately if scattered
- Only proper keyword allows safe removal

**What Tribe WON'T Share (Unless Extreme Trust):**
- The keyword for safe removal
- Why Codex was hidden here (full history)
- Where other temporal bloodlines exist (if any)
- Full extent of temporal magic capabilities

### Secrets

**Hidden Truths:**
1. **Diminishing Bloodline:** Fewer children born with strong temporal powers each generation
2. **Codex Influence:** Living near Codex has made tribe more peaceful over centuries (subtle mind influence?)
3. **Garrek's Fate:** Tribe knows exactly what happened (DM to determine)
4. **Other Sanctuaries:** This isn't the only temporal sanctuary in the world
5. **Temporal Curse:** Using temporal magic too much causes premature aging (tribe manages this through discipline)

**Possible Betrayal:**
- If severely threatened, tribe might use Time Stop to age enemies to death
- Desperate measure only, would haunt them (violates peace philosophy)

### Future Hooks

**Immediate (Session 2):**
- Party discovers tribe guards [[Garrek's Falls]]

- Tribe may ask party for help (diminishing bloodline issue?)
- Someone else seeks Codex (race against rival faction)

**Long-Term (Sessions 10+):**
- [[Nikki]] masters temporal magic with tribe's guidance
- Reveal truth about Codex and why it was hidden
- Threat to sanctuary (party defends with tribe?)
- Connection to ancient civilization and elemental ancestors

### Level-Appropriate Encounters

**Levels 2-3: Discovery & Negotiation**

**Neutral:**

### Narrative Role

**Thematic Purpose:**
