## Important Notes

**Dragon's Own Agenda:**
- Steel Dragon's artistic murder escalation is INDEPENDENT of other plots
- [[Chaos Cult]] is INFLUENCING, not creating this behavior
- Dragon would be dangerous without cult, but cult makes it worse
- Murder pattern follows dragon's artistic vision, not random portents

**Investigation Focus:**
- Early levels are detective work, not combat
- Dragon is CR 13-17, far above early party capabilities
- Cult members are the appropriate-level threats
- Social/political complications drive mid-level play
