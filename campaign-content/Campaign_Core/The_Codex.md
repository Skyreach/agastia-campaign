## Development Notes

**Status:** While the Codex is established as important to the campaign ([[Professor Zero]]'s search, [[Manny]] and [[Nikki]]'s missions), its exact nature and specific role remain flexible for optimal campaign integration.

**Priority:** Define concrete details as [[Professor Zero]] becomes more active in the campaign, [[Manny]] and [[Nikki]] pursue their missions, or other plot threads create natural connections to dominion evolution themes.

**Themes to Consider:**
- Evolution of power and control
- Transformation across lifetimes (Steel Dragon)
- Merit-based vs. other forms of dominion
- Knowledge as power and danger
- Who should control transformative information
