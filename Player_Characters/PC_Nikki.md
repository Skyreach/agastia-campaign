## DM Notes

### Secrets & Hidden Info
- **True Past:** Parents owned Italian restaurant in Agastia's merchant district
- **Memory Wipe:** Kidnapped and memory-wiped at age 10 by Professor Zero
- **Unconscious Memory:** Food fascination is residual memory of family business
- **Parents' Fate:** Unknown - restaurant may still exist
- **Subject #2 = Second Newest:** Newer recruit, less experienced than higher numbers
- **Not Mistkin:** Nikki has NO connection to Temporal Bloodline - just following Zero's orders to find them
- **Doesn't Care About Mistkin:** They're just a target/mission objective to her
- **Unaware of Consequences:** Doesn't know reporting Mistkin location could endanger them

### Future Hooks
- Rediscovering family restaurant
- Finding parents (alive? dead? searching for lost child?)
- Italian food triggering memories
- Loyalty crisis when learning truth about Professor Zero
- Relationship development with Nona
- Moral choice: Professor Zero vs. Manny's safety
- Locating Mistkin at Garrek's Falls - mission accomplished, reports to Zero
- Brand's connection to Mistkin (Storm Lords are their allies) creates party tension
- Learning what Professor Zero does with people she reports to him
- Realizing her reconnaissance missions endanger innocent people
- Does she care more about Brand (party member) than completing Zero's mission?

### Character Development Notes
- Protective instinct may conflict with Professor Zero's orders
- Food connection can be slow-burn emotional storyline
- Subject #2 = newer recruit, still proving herself
- Currently sees Mistkin as just another mission objective (emotionally detached)
- Brand's connection to Mistkin creates party conflict: Friend vs. mission
- Doesn't question Zero's orders yet - loyal and obedient
- Character growth: From blind obedience â†’ realizing consequences of her actions
