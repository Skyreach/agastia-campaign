## DM Notes

### Secrets & Hidden Info
- **Beholder Hired Giant:** The beholder who employed Rakash actually hired the storm giant to destroy Ratterdan (player doesn't know)
- **Zhaask's Role:** Traitor provided information to enable the attack
- **Professor Zero Connection:** Nature of "knowing a little" through Niletrix unclear - potential plot thread
- **Giant's Motive:** Why target a goblin village? Connected to beholder's plans
- **Prosthetics Origin:** Dwarves of IdleCreek have questions about the attack

### Future Hooks
- Discovery that beholder hired the giant (major betrayal)
- Confrontation with Zhaask
- Tracking and fighting storm giant (high-level encounter)
- Completing beholder earring (magical item reward)
- Prosthetics may have hidden features or tracking
- Professor Zero connection through Niletrix
- Rebuilding Ratterdan or honoring the dead

### Character Development Notes
- Survivor's guilt drives barbarian rage
- Prosthetics = physical reminder of loss
- Revenge arc can resolve or consume character
- Beholder betrayal revelation will be devastating
- Kyle relationship is anchor preventing total darkness
- Return to Ratterdan (Session 1) will be emotionally charged

### Combat Considerations
- Storm giant is CR 13 (very high level threat for later)
- Giant's axe left at Ratterdan (artifact-level weapon)
- Zhaask encounter mid-level conflict
- Beholder confrontation high-stakes social/combat
