- **Bandit Network Still Active:** Kaelborn and Geist running operations near/in Agastia
- **Message Intercept:** Contents and destination could reveal larger conspiracy
- **True Name:** "Nameless" is the name Eliyen gave; birth name lost/unknown
- **Feywild Time:** 100 years for him = different time passage for others
- **Rainbow Hair Origin:** Homebrew race - could tie to Feywild, magic bloodline, or curse
- **Why Kidnapped:** Rainbow hair had specific value to bandits (collect? sell? ritual?)

### Future Hooks
- Confronting Kaelborn and Geist (major combat encounter)
- Discovering bandit network extent
- Feywild duty vs. personal vengeance conflict
- Lady Eliyen subplot (romance? friendship? debt?)
- Lord Zaos calling in favor or ending leave early
- Fiddle's true power revelation
- Learning about rainbow hair origin
- Beans reappearance
- Rakash rescue creating deep bond

### Character Development Notes
- 100 years of service = very experienced despite being "on leave"
- Patient and strategic from Fey military training
- Rescue instinct (saved Rakash) may be pattern
- Bandit hunt is personal but needs to be justice, not pure revenge
- Feywild connections provide resources and obligations
- Rainbow hair makes him identifiable (blessing and curse)

### Combat Considerations
- Ranger/Rogue multiclass = versatile skirmisher
- Eldritch Adept feat adds magical option
- Fiddle may have bardic or utility magic
- Feywild training = unconventional tactics
- Kaelborn (sorcerer) and Geist (assassin) are high-skill enemies

### Bandit Leaders (Major Antagonists)
- **Kaelborn:** Elf sorcerer, charismatic leader
- **Geist:** Dwarf assassin, brutal enforcer
- **Network:** Operating near Agastia (maybe infiltrated city)
- **Threat Level:** Mid-campaign boss encounters
