---

### 3. NAMING INCONSISTENCY

**Issue:** Nikki's Family Restaurant
- **Session 2 Name:** "Il Drago Rosso (The Red Dragon)" (Line 396)
- **File Name:** "The Delizioso Trattoria" (`Shop_The_Delizioso_Trattoria.md`)
- **Impact:** Moderate - could confuse players
- **Recommendation:** CHOOSE ONE CANONICAL NAME and update all references

**Options:**
1. Use "Il Drago Rosso" (Session 2 name, more thematic to Nikki's tiefling heritage)
2. Use "The Delizioso Trattoria" (existing file name, more generic Italian)
3. Combine: "Il Drago Rosso Trattoria" or "The Delizioso (Il Drago Rosso)"

**Suggested Resolution:** Update file to match Session 2 reference "Il Drago Rosso"

---

### 4. MINOR GAPS (Not Critical)

#### Warehouse 7
- **Status:** Referenced extensively but no dedicated file
- **Importance:** MEDIUM
- **Function:** Geist's criminal base of operations
- **Recommendation:** Could be part of Geist's NPC file or Dock District file
- **Alternative:** Create standalone location file if it becomes a dungeon/combat location

#### The Gilded Gryphon Inn
- **Status:** Referenced in Session 2, unclear if file exists
- **Importance:** LOW (generic inn)
- **Recommendation:** Verify if this is documented; if not, minor priority

#### Brian Thornscale (Mayor)
- **Status:** Mentioned once in Session 2
- **Importance:** LOW
- **Function:** Mayor at Meridian's Rest
- **Recommendation:** Low priority, may not need dedicated file (minor NPC)

---

## Continuity Issues

### 1. Restaurant Name Inconsistency (MODERATE)
**Issue:** Nikki's family restaurant has two different names
**Session Reference:** "Il Drago Rosso (The Red Dragon)"
**File Name:** "The Delizioso Trattoria"
**Resolution Needed:** Choose canonical name and update all references

### 2. No Major Continuity Errors Found
- District tier system consistent across files
- NPC roles and relationships align with session references
- Pricing and services generally consistent
- Faction allegiances coherent

---

## Recommendations

### IMMEDIATE PRIORITY (Before Session 2 Play)

1. **Create Geist NPC File**
   - Path: `/mnt/e/dnd/agastia-campaign/NPCs/Faction_NPCs/NPC_Geist_Inspector.md`
   - Include: Stats, personality, criminal operations, relationship to Kaelborn
   - Urgency: HIGH - major antagonist for Kyle's quest

2. **Create Kaelborn NPC File**
   - Path: `/mnt/e/dnd/agastia-campaign/NPCs/Faction_NPCs/NPC_Kaelborn_Trade_Official.md`
   - Include: Public vs. private persona, political power, criminal network
   - Urgency: HIGH - ultimate investigation target

3. **Resolve Restaurant Name**
   - Choose canonical name (recommend "Il Drago Rosso")
   - Update file name to match
   - Update all session references
   - Urgency: MEDIUM - prevents player confusion

### HIGH PRIORITY (Before Session 3)

4. **Create Archive of Lost Histories File**
   - Path: `/mnt/e/dnd/agastia-campaign/Locations/Cities/Agastia/Library_Archive_of_Lost_Histories.md`
   - Include: Layout, services, research mechanics, Veridian's role
   - Urgency: MEDIUM - Manny's quest location

5. **Create Stonemark Antiquities File**
   - Path: `/mnt/e/dnd/agastia-campaign/Locations/Cities/Agastia/Shop_Stonemark_Antiquities.md`
   - Include: Inventory, pricing, Mirella's knowledge, quest hooks
   - Urgency: MEDIUM - Manny's quest location

### OPTIONAL IMPROVEMENTS

6. **Document Warehouse 7**
   - Could be part of Geist's NPC file or standalone location
   - Include layout if combat encounter planned
   - Urgency: LOW - can be improvised

7. **Verify The Gilded Gryphon Inn**
   - Check if file exists or needs creation
   - Standard inn, low complexity
   - Urgency: LOW

8. **Create Brian Thornscale NPC (Optional)**
   - Mayor of Meridian's Rest
   - Very minor role, may not need file
   - Urgency: VERY LOW

---

## Coverage Quality Assessment

### Strengths
- ✅ Excellent district-level documentation (100% coverage)
- ✅ Strong NPC documentation for established characters
- ✅ Comprehensive establishment files for most locations
- ✅ Detailed tier system and social structure
- ✅ Rich world-building in existing files

### Weaknesses
- ❌ Two critical NPCs (Geist, Kaelborn) lack files despite heavy session use
- ❌ Two important locations (Archive, Stonemark) lack dedicated files
- ⚠️ Naming inconsistency for Nikki's restaurant
- ⚠️ Some establishments referenced but not verified to exist as files

### Overall Grade: B+
**Justification:** Excellent structural coverage (districts, major locations), strong existing documentation quality, but missing 2 critical NPC files and 2 location files that are actively used in session planning. Resolving these 4 gaps would bring grade to A.

---

## Action Plan Summary

**Before Session 2 Runs:**
1. Create Geist NPC file
2. Create Kaelborn NPC file
3. Fix restaurant naming inconsistency

**Before Session 3 Runs:**
4. Create Archive of Lost Histories location file
5. Create Stonemark Antiquities location file

**Optional Future Work:**
6. Document Warehouse 7 (if combat location)
7. Verify/create The Gilded Gryphon Inn file
8. Create Brian Thornscale NPC file (low priority)

## File Path Reference

### Created Files Needed

```
/mnt/e/dnd/agastia-campaign/NPCs/Faction_NPCs/NPC_Geist_Inspector.md
/mnt/e/dnd/agastia-campaign/NPCs/Faction_NPCs/NPC_Kaelborn_Trade_Official.md
/mnt/e/dnd/agastia-campaign/Locations/Cities/Agastia/Library_Archive_of_Lost_Histories.md
/mnt/e/dnd/agastia-campaign/Locations/Cities/Agastia/Shop_Stonemark_Antiquities.md
```

### Files to Update

```
/mnt/e/dnd/agastia-campaign/Locations/Cities/Agastia/Shop_The_Delizioso_Trattoria.md
→ Rename to: Shop_Il_Drago_Rosso.md (or update Session 2 references)
```

---

## Conclusion

The Agastia campaign world has **excellent foundational coverage** with comprehensive district documentation and strong establishment detail. The primary gaps are **2 critical NPC files** (Geist and Kaelborn) that are heavily referenced in Session 2 planning but lack dedicated documentation, and **2 important location files** (Archive of Lost Histories and Stonemark Antiquities) that serve as quest locations.

Addressing these 4 files before Session 2 runs will bring the campaign to near-complete coverage for early-game content. No major continuity errors were found, indicating good consistency in world-building across documents.

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Prioritize Geist and Kaelborn NPC files (critical for Kyle's quest)
2. Resolve restaurant naming before players visit Merchant District
3. Create Archive and Stonemark files when Manny's Codex quest becomes active
4. Continue excellent documentation practices for future locations
