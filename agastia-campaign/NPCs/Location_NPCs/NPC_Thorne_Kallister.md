**Mayor of Meridian's Rest | Retired Adventurer**

---

## Player Summary

### Basic Information
- **Race:** Human (grizzled veteran, early 50s)
- **Role:** Mayor of Meridian's Rest, quest giver
- **Faction:** Independent (serves the town)
- **Location:** Meridian's Rest town hall

### Appearance
A broad-shouldered human with a thick salt-and-pepper beard and weathered features. Wears simple but well-maintained leather armor under a fur-lined cloak, even while doing mayoral duties. A massive greatsword hangs on the wall behind his desk—clearly well-used but no longer carried. Walks with a slight limp from an old injury.

### Personality
- **Trait:** Gruff but warm; tells war stories unprompted
- **Quirk:** Compares every problem to "back in my day" adventuring tales
- **Manner:** Direct, practical, expects competence
- **Weakness:** Secretly lonely; misses the adventuring life

### Known History
Thorne was an accomplished adventurer in his younger years, leading a party called "The Clawbreakers" through the Underdark and beyond. Retired to Meridian's Rest after losing companions in a dungeon collapse. Now serves as mayor, using his experience to protect the town and guide younger adventurers.

## DM Notes

### True Background

**The Clawbreakers (Former Party):**
- Thorne "The Bear" Kallister - Fighter (leader)
- Elara Mistshaper - Wizard (deceased - dungeon collapse)
- Garrek - Rogue/Scout (deceased - dungeon collapse, **the deep gnome who discovered Garrek's Falls**)
- Jorik Stonefist - Cleric (deceased - dungeon collapse)

**The Unfinished Quest:**
Thorne's party was exploring the Underdark 20+ years ago when Garrek discovered a hidden waterfall with miraculous healing properties. Garrek wanted to map it and return, but the party pressed onward to complete their current mission. That mission ended in disaster—a cave-in killed three of Thorne's companions, including Garrek.

**Guilt & Regret:**
- Blames himself for pushing the party too hard
- Never followed up on Garrek's discovery
- Keeps Garrek's original journal (partially burned) in his study
- Knows the general area of the falls but not exact location
- Has prevented others from searching (water's addictive properties scare him)

**Why Now?:**
Recent travelers report strange activity near where Garrek's Falls should be. Thorne is too old and injured to investigate himself, but he sees capable adventurers arriving and feels it's time to finish what his friend started.

### Personality Deep Dive

**Public Face:**
- Gruff, no-nonsense mayor focused on town defense
- Tells heroic war stories to inspire (and intimidate)
- Respected by townsfolk for competence and experience
- Quick to offer quests to capable groups

**Private Truth:**
- Deeply lonely after losing entire adventuring party
- Sees younger adventurers and feels both pride and jealousy
- Uses "back in my day" stories to stay connected to glory days
- Protective in fatherly way—doesn't want others to repeat his mistakes

**With the Party:**
- Initially tests their competence with practical quests
- Warms up after seeing them succeed
- Eventually shares war stories with genuine emotion
- Offers tactical advice and warnings based on experience
- May reveal Garrek's Falls quest once he trusts them

### Relationships

**Allies:**
- **Torvin Greycask:** Drinking buddy, shares town defense responsibilities
- **Meridian's Rest Guard Captain:** Reports to Thorne, respects his tactical mind
- **Local Blacksmith:** Made Thorne's greatsword, maintains it for free

**Complicated:**
- **Elara Mistshaper's Descendants:** If any exist, Thorne sends them money anonymously (guilt over her death)
- **Other Retired Adventurers:** Camaraderie mixed with painful memories

**Secrets Known:**
- Location (general area) of Garrek's Falls
- Danger of the healing waters (addiction)
- Details of the dungeon collapse that killed his party
- Hidden Underdark passages near Meridian's Rest

### Quest Hooks

#### Quest 1: Monster Hunt (Immediate Income)
**Hook:** "We've got a [creature] problem on the trade road. 50 gold to the group that brings back proof it's dead. Back in my day, we'd have handled three of these before breakfast."

**Details:**
- Practical income opportunity
- Tests party's combat capability
- Thorne evaluates their tactics and teamwork
- Success earns his respect

#### Quest 2: Defend Against Moon's Assault (Mid-Session Crisis)

**Details:**
- Town defense scenario (see Moon's Assault mechanics)
- Thorne fights alongside party (limited - old injury flares up)
- Shares tactical advice during battle
- Success creates strong bond with Thorne

#### Quest 3: Investigate Rumors Near Garrek's Falls (Personal Quest)
**Hook:** *Only offered after Quests 1 & 2.* "I need to tell you something. Years ago, my friend Garrek found something in the Underdark. I let him die before we could explore it. Now I'm hearing rumors of movement in that area. I can't go myself—this damn leg—but I trust you. Find out what's happening there."

**Details:**
- Thorne provides Garrek's partially burned journal (sketchy map, notes about "healing water")
- Warns about addictive properties (he read Garrek's warnings)
- Asks party to map location and report back
- Payment: 100 gp + "anything Garrek left behind is yours"
- **Actual Discovery:** Leads party to Garrek's Falls, Temporal Bloodline Tribe, Codex of Peace

### Garrek's Journal (Prop)

**Condition:** Water-damaged, partially burned, pages stuck together
**Legible Contents:**
- Sketch of waterfall with "gravity-defying streams"
- Note: "Lavender and honey scent—never smelled anything like it"
- Warning: "Water heals, but Jorik says it feels wrong. Addictive?"
- Map fragment showing tunnel route (incomplete, DC 15 Survival to follow)
- Final entry: "Thorne wants to push on. I'll map this later. Hope we all make it back."

- "Protect the civilians first—walls can be rebuilt, people can't!"

**Post-Battle:**

- Becomes vulnerable: "You remind me of my old crew. They'd have liked you."

## Dialogue Examples

### First Meeting (Quest 1 - Monster Hunt)
> "You're the new arrivals everyone's talking about. Got the look of adventurers—not sellswords, actual adventurers. Good. We've got work for capable hands. Trade road's got a [creature] problem. Fifty gold for proof it's dead. Back in my day, my party handled three of these before breakfast, but I'm willing to see what you're made of."

### After Quest 1 Success
> "Not bad. You work together well—that's rarer than you'd think. Most groups are just five people swinging swords in the same direction. You've got coordination. Keep that up and you'll live longer than most."

### During Moon's Assault (Mid-Battle)
> "Left flank's buckling! You three—with me! The rest hold the gate! And someone get me a damn torch—these mongrels hate fire!"
> *(After injury forces him to step back):* "Bah! Damn leg... You've got this! Remember your training!"

### Offering Garrek's Falls Quest (Personal Moment)
> *(Pours two drinks, slides one over)* "I don't usually do this, but... you've earned my trust. Twenty years ago, I led a party called the Clawbreakers. We were good. Damn good. But I got them killed—pushed too hard, ignored warnings. My friend Garrek... he found something in the Underdark. A waterfall. Said it could heal anything. I didn't listen. Made him keep going. Then the cave-in..."
>
> *(Pause, drinks)*
>
> "I'm hearing rumors of movement near where Garrek died. I can't go myself—this leg won't make the climb. But I trust you. Find out what's happening there. Finish what Garrek started. Whatever he left behind is yours. Just... be careful with that water. Garrek's notes said it was dangerous."

### Handing Over Journal
> "This is all I have left of him. Water-damaged, half-burned, but it's got his map. He always was a better scout than I was a leader. Bring him closure, would you?"

## Version History

- **1.0.0** (2025-10-18): Initial creation - Mayor of Meridian's Rest, retired adventurer, three-quest structure, Garrek's Falls connection

---

**DM Guidance:** Thorne is an emotional anchor for the Garrek's Falls discovery. Use him to build trust over Quests 1 & 2, then leverage that trust to make Quest 3 feel personal. The party should want to honor Garrek's memory, not just collect a paycheck.
