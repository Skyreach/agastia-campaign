## DM Notes

### True Identity

**Mistkin (Temporal Bloodline):**
- Born to Mistkin tribe at Garrek's Falls
- Left the sanctuary to explore the world
- Only Mistkin to leave in generations
- Tribe knows she's out there, worries about her safety
- Uses cover identity as "tiefling" to hide temporal abilities

**Why She Left:**
- Saw visions of future events affecting the world
- Felt compelled to act on what she saw
- Tribe wanted her to stay hidden and safe
- Chose duty over safety

### Mistkin Abilities

**Future Sight (Augury):**
- Can see glimpses of the future
- This is how she "predicts" traps and dangers
- Explains her strategic brilliance
- Sees the impending doom threatening the world

**Time Manipulation:**
- Can cast *haste* or *slow* twice per day (innate)
- Falls unconscious after 3rd casting (dangerous limitation)
- Rarely uses this in public (keeps ability secret)

**Slow Aging:**
- Ages slightly slower than normal races
- Helps maintain cover (looks appropriate age for her story)

### The Cover Story

**What People Believe:**
- She's a tiefling archaeologist
- Her skills come from experience and natural talent
- Her "intuition" is just expert knowledge

**What She Hides:**
- Temporal abilities (future sight, time magic)

**What Lyria Has Seen:**
- Vision of catastrophic future event (details TBD for future session)
- Believes she must act to prevent it
- Recruited adventurers to help stop the doom
- **Tragic Irony:** Her intervention might CAUSE another doom (self-fulfilling prophecy/time paradox)

**The Paradox:**

## Dialogue Examples

### First Meeting (Professional Archaeologist)
> "I've been tracking rumors of [artifact/site] for months. The expedition is dangerous, but I don't work with amateurs. Your reputation precedes you. I'm offering 200 gold for successful retrieval, plus a share of any other discoveries. Interested?"

### Using "Intuition" (Hidden Future Sight)
> "Wait. Don't touch that yet." *(Studies trap)* "There's a pressure plate three inches to the left. Trust me on this - I've seen this design before."
> *(Actually saw it spring in a vision)*

### Rare Vulnerability
> "Sometimes I see things... futures that might be. It's not magic, just... pattern recognition. A gift and a curse. I saw something terrible coming, and I can't ignore it. That's why I need your help."

### If Identity Discovered
> "You're right. I'm not a tiefling. My people call themselves Mistkin - we experience time differently. I left them to prevent a catastrophe I foresaw. Judge me if you want, but the doom I'm trying to prevent doesn't care about my secrets."

### To Nikki (If Connection Discovered)
> "Your employer wants to find my people. Why? They're peaceful, hiding from a world that hunted them. If you report me, you endanger everyone I love. But you're also my ally. So I'm asking: Who do you choose to protect?"

## Version History

- **1.0.0** (2025-10-18): Initial creation - Mistkin archaeologist, doom prevention arc, temporal paradox setup

---

**DM Guidance:** Lyria is a slow-burn revelation character. Introduce her as competent, trustworthy patron. Let party bond with her. THEN reveal she's Mistkin Nikki is hunting. THEN reveal her doom-prevention efforts might cause another catastrophe. Each revelation adds layer of complexity and player choice. She's meant to embody theme: "Good intentions, dangerous consequences."
