## Downtime Activity Integration

### Parallel Activities (No Waiting Required)

**Crafting Happens Alongside Quests:**

- Crafting time ticks down in background while other activities happen
- Example: Manny starts brewing potion, party does Quest 1, potion done when they return

**Simultaneous Activities:**
- One PC crafts in town while others go on quest
- Gatherers leave early morning, return by evening
- Split party activities allowed during downtime

**Shared Projects:**
- Multiple PCs collaborate on gathering ingredients (faster, safer)
- Manny crafts while Nikki provides Arcane assistance (advantage on checks)
- Party can gather ingredients as part of other exploration

---

## DM Guidance

### Balancing Crafting Time

**Don't Let Crafting Dominate Session:**
- Handle crafting declarations at start of downtime
- Roll gathering checks quickly
- Fast-forward through crafting days with narration
- Focus on roleplay during crafting (conversations with NPCs)

**Example Narration:**
> "Over the next two days, Manny works at Greta's apothecary, brewing potions while the rest of you pursue your own interests. Greta teaches him a trick for extracting maximum potency from silverleaf. During this time, what are the rest of you doing?"

### Random Encounter System

**Roll d6 when gathering ingredients:**
- **1-5:** No encounter, gathering proceeds normally
- **6:** Encounter! Roll on appropriate table below

**Keep It Light:**
- Most encounters are minor obstacles, not deadly combat
- Use encounters for worldbuilding and variety
- Some encounters can be avoided with clever play

**Exception:**
- If party wants major ingredient expedition, make it a mini-quest
- "The rarest component is guarded by [creature]—this could be dangerous"

## DM Tips for Gathering Encounters

**Roll Encounter Once Per Location:**
- Forest gathering = 1 roll
- Cave gathering = 1 roll
- Don't spam encounters every hour

- Rival adventurers = world feels lived-in

**Reward Creative Solutions:**
- Animal Handling to calm beasts
- Stealth to avoid combat
- Nature to identify safe paths
- Offering food/treasure to intelligent creatures

**Encounter = Ingredient Bonus:**
- Defeating/bypassing encounter grants extra ingredients
- Example: Giant spider defeated = bonus spider silk worth 10 gp
- Encourages engaging with encounters

### Reward Generosity

**Post-Corruption Gratitude:**
- Greta and Aldwin give 15-20% discounts
- Thorne offers free lodging and advice
- Locals volunteer to guide for free (first time)

**Why:**
- Party saved the town—they're heroes
