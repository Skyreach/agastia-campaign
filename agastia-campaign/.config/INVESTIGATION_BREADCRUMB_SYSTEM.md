# Investigation Breadcrumb System

**Purpose:** Player-initiated investigations can happen anytime, anywhere. This system provides breadcrumbs that point toward where mysteries can be solved, even if current location can't provide full answers.

**Philosophy:** Never say "you find nothing." Always provide SOMETHING - even if it's just a pointer to where they should look next.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Always Reward Investigation
- Player asks? They get something
- May not solve mystery here, but they learn WHERE to go
- Builds momentum, doesn't stall player agency

### 2. Breadcrumb Tiers
- **Tier 1 (Anywhere):** Vague rumors, general direction, "you've heard stories about..."
- **Tier 2 (Regional):** More specific location, NPC who knows more, "people in [place] would know"
- **Tier 3 (At Location):** Full investigation system activates (3-3-3-1 structure)

### 3. Delivery Methods
- **NPCs:** Townsfolk, travelers, merchants share rumors
- **Documents:** Books, journals, old records
- **Environmental:** Symbols, carvings, artifacts hint at connections
- **Dream/Vision:** For magical/temporal mysteries (use sparingly)

## Kyle/Nameless: Geist & Kaelborn Investigation

### What Kyle Wants to Find
- Geist's location and operations
- Evidence of criminal activity
- Kaelborn's role and whereabouts
- How to bring them down despite Merit Council protection

### Breadcrumb Delivery (By Location)

#### Tier 1: Anywhere (Meridian's Rest, small towns, wilderness)
**When Kyle asks locals/travelers about Geist:**

**Rumor 1 (DC 10 Persuasion/Investigation):**
> "Geist? Name sounds familiar... I think there's a Merit Council official by that name in Agastia. Trade inspector or something? Handles dock inspections."

**Rumor 2 (DC 12 Persuasion, from merchant):**
> "If you're looking for Geist, try the Agastia docks. Merchants complain about an Inspector Geist who's... let's say, 'particular' about inspection fees."

**Rumor 3 (DC 15 Investigation, old wanted poster):**
> Faded bounty notice: "Geist and Kaelborn - wanted for banditry, last seen [years ago]." No current information, but confirms they're known criminals.

**Breadcrumb Result:** Points to **Agastia dock district** as investigation location

---

#### Tier 2: Regional (Agastia outskirts, nearby towns)
**When Kyle asks in areas closer to Agastia:**

**Rumor 1 (DC 10 Persuasion, from traveling merchant):**
> "Inspector Geist runs a tight ship at the docks. Too tight, if you ask me. Some traders pay 'inspection fees' that don't show up on official records."

**Rumor 2 (DC 12 Investigation, local tavern):**
> "Heard about a warehouse on Pier 7 that's supposed to hold confiscated goods. Funny thing - goods go in, but they never seem to make it to auction."

**Rumor 3 (DC 13 Streetwise/Criminal contacts):**
> "If you're looking into dock corruption, talk to Harren at the Rusty Anchor. He's a dock worker who's seen things. Or Mira Saltwind in the merchant district - she pays 'protection' to someone."

**Breadcrumb Result:** Points to **specific NPCs and locations** in Agastia (Entry Nodes)

---

#### Tier 3: At Location (Agastia dock district)
**Full 3-3-3-1 investigation activates:**
- 3 Entry Nodes: Harren, Mira Saltwind, Rival Smuggler
- 3 Locations: Warehouse District, Merit Council Records, Black Market
- 9 Clues total
- Revelation: Geist's safe house operation

**See Session_2_WIP_Planning.md lines 63-128 for full structure**

---

### DM Guidance: Kyle's Investigation

**Session 2 (Meridian's Rest):**
- Kyle can ask about Geist, gets Tier 1 breadcrumbs
- Result: "You need to go to Agastia docks to investigate further"
- Builds anticipation for future session

**Session 3+ (Traveling to/arriving in Agastia):**
- Tier 2 breadcrumbs become available
- Kyle gets specific entry node information
- Primes investigation for when they reach city

**At Agastia Docks:**
- Tier 3: Full investigation begins
- 3-3-3-1 structure ensures they can solve it

## Manny: Dominion Codex Investigation

### What Manny Wants to Find
- Location of legendary artifacts
- Specifically the **Dominion Codex** (once he learns about it)
- Temporal Bloodline connection (ties to Nikki's arc)
- Ancient magical knowledge

### Breadcrumb Delivery (By Location)

#### Tier 0: Discovery (Learning the Codex Exists)
**Manny starts with just a name - needs to learn WHAT it is before WHERE.**

**Option A - Research in Meridian's Rest:**
- If Manny asks Aldwin Quill (scribe) or searches small library
- DC 15 Investigation/History
- Finds fragmentary text: "...Dominion Codex, bound artifact of great power... communities protected from violence... location unknown, Underdark rumors persist..."
- **Result:** Knows "Dominion Codex" exists, protective artifact, no specific location

**Option B - Agastia Scholar Quarter (Future Session):**
- Manny researches "Dominion Codex" in proper library
- DC 12 Investigation (easier with better resources)
- Scholar: "Dominion Codex is legendary protective artifact. Supposedly hidden in the Underdark. Deep gnome expeditions centuries ago mentioned it... never confirmed or recovered."
- **Result:** Knows what Dominion Codex is, vague Underdark location, deep gnome connection

**Option C - Garrek's Journal (Quest 3 Reward):**
- Journal describes artifact but doesn't use name "Dominion Codex"
- "There's a book... bound to a stone pedestal. Metal pages that turn on their own. Blue light flowing through symbols. The people call it something else, but I recognize the descriptions from old texts..."
- Manny must connect: "This matches Dominion Codex descriptions from legends!"
- **Result:** Combined discovery - learns artifact AND location simultaneously

---

#### Tier 1: General Location (Underdark, Deep Gnome Expeditions)
**When Manny asks about Dominion Codex location:**

**Rumor 1 (DC 10 Arcana/History):**
> "The Underdark has ruins older than surface civilization. Ancient texts, artifacts... dangerous to seek, but they're down there."

**Rumor 2 (DC 12 Investigation, from scholar/scribe):**
> "If you're seeking the Dominion Codex, talk to historians in Agastia's Scholar Quarter. They catalog deep gnome expedition reports."

**Rumor 3 (DC 13 History, old stories):**
> "Deep gnome explorers sometimes find incredible things. One named Garrek supposedly discovered something extraordinary before he died. His companions never followed up - too painful after the cave-in."

**Breadcrumb Result:** Points to **Underdark exploration, deep gnome expeditions, Garrek's name appears**

---

#### Tier 2: Specific Location (Garrek's Falls Route)
**After completing Thorne's Quests 1 & 2:**

**Garrek's Journal (Quest 3 reward):**
> "There's a book... bound to a stone pedestal. Metal pages that turn on their own. Blue light flowing through symbols. I've seen descriptions like this in old expedition reports - could this be the Dominion Codex? The people living near the falls have their own name for it, but they won't say what. They just call it their protector. I want to study it, but Thorne says we need to finish this dungeon first..."

**Thorne's Story (personal conversation):**
> "My friend Garrek found something in the Underdark near where he died. A waterfall, strange people, and some kind of magical book. He was obsessed with ancient artifacts - kept comparing everything to legends he'd read. His journal has the route... or what's left of it after the cave-in."

**Breadcrumb Result:** **Dominion Codex likely at Garrek's Falls, route provided via journal map**

---

#### Tier 3: Discovery at Garrek's Falls
**Quest 3: Investigate Garrek's Falls:**
- Party follows journal map to Underdark location
- Discovers Garrek's Falls and Temporal Bloodline Tribe
- Finds artifact on pedestal - metal pages, blue glyphs, auto-turning
- **Temporal Bloodline calls it "Book of Peace" (their name, not scholarly term)**
- Manny realizes: "This is the Dominion Codex!" (connects research to reality)
- Full artifact mechanics revealed (see Artifact_Codex_of_Peace.md)

**Investigation becomes ACTION:**
- Decision: Remove Dominion Codex or leave it protecting tribe?
- Consequence: Removal triggers explosion, 7 pages scatter as energy
- Connection: Temporal Bloodline needs protection, Nikki's people found

---

### DM Guidance: Manny's Investigation

**Tier 0 Delivery:**
- If Manny researches early → Option A or B
- If Manny waits until Quest 3 → Option C (combined discovery)
- Don't force - let him discover naturally through investigation

**Session 2 (Meridian's Rest):**
- Tier 0: Available if Manny asks Aldwin or researches
- Tier 1: General Underdark hints available
- Tier 2: Unlocks ONLY after Quests 1 & 2 complete (Thorne trusts party)
- Garrek's journal is the major clue delivery mechanism

**Garrek's Journal as Multi-Purpose Clue:**
- **Manny:** Describes artifact matching Dominion Codex (doesn't name it directly)
- **Nikki:** Mentions "time seems wrong" near falls (Temporal Bloodline hint)
- **Party:** Provides map to Garrek's Falls
- **Thorne:** Emotional closure for friend's death

**At Garrek's Falls:**
- Tribe calls it "Book of Peace" - their cultural name
- Scholarly texts call it "Dominion Codex" - academic name
- Same artifact, different names based on perspective
- Manny gets "aha!" moment connecting research to reality

**Future Sessions:**
- Dominion Codex becomes central campaign artifact
- Fragment recovery (if removed) = long-term quest arc
- 7 scattered pages to recover and restore

## Josh/Brand: Ancestor Investigation

### What Josh Wants to Find
- Who his ancestors were
- What civilization created his elemental markings
- Why he has these powers
- What happened to his people
- Where they are now (if any survive)

### The Revelation (Final Discovery)
[TBD - Brand's people and their connection to Garrek's Falls to be determined during play]

### Mistkin (Temporal Bloodline) Lore

**Abilities:**
- **Future Sight:** Can see glimpses of the future (augury-style prophecy)
- **Time Manipulation:** Innately cast *haste* or *slow* twice per day, fall unconscious after 3rd casting
- **Slow Aging:** Age slightly slower than normal races

**Current Situation:**
- Hiding from past trauma at Garrek's Falls
- Protected by Dominion Codex
- Most stay hidden in sanctuary
- **Exception:** Lyria, a Mistkin who left tribe to become adventuring archaeologist (see NPC_Lyria.md)

**Lyria's Role:**
- Appears as tiefling, hides Mistkin heritage
- Famous archaeologist, expert strategist and trap disarmer (uses future sight)
- Foresaw impending doom, recruits party to prevent it (Session 3+)
- **Paradox:** Her intervention to stop doom might cause another
- **Nikki's Dilemma:** Lyria is Mistkin Zero wants found - report or protect?

### Connection to Other Mysteries
- **Manny's Arc:** Dominion Codex protects Mistkin
- **Nikki's Arc:** Hunting Mistkin for Zero; Lyria is Mistkin hiding in plain sight
- **Brand's Arc:** TBD - connection to Garrek's Falls to be determined
- **Party Decision:** Removing Codex endangers Mistkin

---

## Nikki: Temporal Bloodline Investigation

### What Nikki Wants to Find
- Members of Temporal Bloodline tribe
- Others with temporal magic abilities
- Understanding of her own origins (Subject #2)
- Connection between Decimate Project and Temporal Bloodline

### Breadcrumb Delivery (By Location)

#### Tier 1: Anywhere (Meridian's Rest, small towns)
**When Nikki asks about temporal magic/Temporal Bloodline:**

**Rumor 1 (DC 12 Arcana, from mage):**
> "Time magic is forbidden by most magic schools - too dangerous, too unpredictable. But there are stories of people born with it naturally. A bloodline, maybe? They hide, though. Chronomancers draw unwanted attention."

**Rumor 2 (DC 13 History, from old scholar):**
> "I've heard whispers of a tribe that lives outside normal time. They age differently, see past and future. Underdark dwellers, I think? Hard to find - time magic lets them hide their sanctuaries."

**Rumor 3 (DC 15 Investigation, Decimate Project connection):**
> "The Decimate Project was studying something. Bloodlines with unusual abilities. Temporal manipulation was one of them. Subject #2... that was temporal, wasn't it? Where did they get those test subjects?"

**Breadcrumb Result:** Points to **Underdark sanctuary, hidden tribe, Decimate Project connection**

---

#### Tier 2: Meridian's Rest Specific (Garrek's Journal)
**After Thorne gives party Garrek's Journal (Quest 3):**

**Journal Entry:**
> "The people living near the falls are strange. They speak of events that haven't happened yet, remember things that never were. Time feels... wrong around them. Not in a bad way - just different. They say they're protected by the book, hidden from those who would harm them. I think they're refugees from something terrible."

**Thorne's Insight (if asked):**
> "Garrek wrote about strange people near that waterfall. Said time worked differently around them. He thought they were hiding from someone. Never got to follow up... Do you think they're still there?"

**Breadcrumb Result:** **Temporal Bloodline at Garrek's Falls, protected by Codex, hiding from persecution**

---

#### Tier 3: Garrek's Falls Discovery
**When party reaches location:**

**Encounter:**
- Temporal Bloodline tribe lives in sanctuary
- Codex of Peace protects them from violence
- Recognize Nikki's temporal abilities immediately
- Reveal: "You're one of us. How did you escape?"

**Investigation becomes REUNION:**
- Nikki meets her people
- Learns: Decimate Project kidnapped Temporal Bloodline members for experiments
- She was Subject #2, others were test subjects too
- Tribe asks: Will you help free the others? Will you stay with us?
- Connection: Codex protects tribe, but removal = exposure to enemies

---

### DM Guidance: Nikki's Investigation

**Session 2 (Meridian's Rest):**
- Tier 1 breadcrumbs if she asks
- Tier 2 delivered via Garrek's Journal (shared with Manny)
- Both PCs now want to visit Garrek's Falls (different reasons)

**Garrek's Falls Quest:**
- Nikki finds her people
- Manny finds legendary artifact
- Party faces moral choice: Remove Codex? Protect tribe?
- Ties two PC arcs together beautifully

**Long-Term:**
- Temporal Bloodline becomes ally faction
- Nikki's origin story deepens
- Decimate Project becomes major antagonist (rescued/hunted subjects)

## Ian/Rakash: Storm Giant Brigade Investigation

### What Ian Wants to Find
- Storm Giant warband that destroyed his village
- Information about giant movements
- Opportunity for revenge
- Understanding why giants attacked

### Breadcrumb Delivery (By Location)

#### Tier 1: Anywhere (Meridian's Rest, small towns)
**When Ian asks about Storm Giants:**

**Rumor 1 (DC 10 Survival/History, from hunter):**
> "Storm Giants? They don't usually bother with surface settlements. Something drove them to attack. Territorial dispute? Resource conflict? Giants don't act without reason."

**Rumor 2 (DC 12 Investigation, from merchant):**
> "I've heard reports of giant activity in the northern mountains. Storm Giants specifically. They're organized - not just random raids. Someone's leading them."

**Rumor 3 (DC 13 History, from veteran):**
> "Giants have long memories and strict hierarchies. If a Storm Giant warband attacked your village, it was ordered. Find out who gave the order, you find your target."

**Breadcrumb Result:** Points to **northern mountains, organized warband, specific leader**

---

#### Tier 2: Meridian's Rest Specific (Thorne's Knowledge)
**When Ian talks with Thorne about giants:**

**Thorne's Experience (veteran's perspective):**
> "I've fought giants. Storm Giants are the worst - disciplined, magical, and damn near unstoppable. But they follow orders. If a warband hit your village, someone commanded it. Giants don't act on whim."

**Tactical Advice:**
> "You want revenge? Don't rush in. Learn their movements, their commander, their weaknesses. I've seen too many warriors die charging giants blindly. Be smart, goblin. Use your rage when the moment's right."

**Information:**
> "There's a giant-tracker in Agastia. Dwarf named Korag Ironfoot. He monitors giant movements for the Merit Council. If anyone knows where your warband is, it's him."

**Breadcrumb Result:** **Specific NPC contact (Korag Ironfoot in Agastia), tactical guidance, validation of revenge quest**

---

#### Tier 2: Agastia (Merit Council Intelligence)
**When Ian contacts Korag Ironfoot:**

**Korag's Information (DC 13 Persuasion or gold):**
> "Storm Giant warband in the northern Spine Ridge mountains. Led by a giant named Thaldrak Stormcaller. They've been raiding settlements for the past year. Pattern suggests they're gathering resources - food, metal, magic items. Building up for something bigger."

**Details:**
> "Thaldrak has about 15-20 giants under his command, plus enslaved smaller humanoids. They're based in an old cloud giant fortress called Skyshatter Spire. Attacking directly is suicide. But if you're patient, I can tell you their raiding routes..."

**Breadcrumb Result:** **Commander identified (Thaldrak), location known (Skyshatter Spire), opportunity for ambush/sabotage**

---

#### Tier 3: Confronting the Warband (Mid-Late Campaign)
**When party pursues Storm Giants:**

**Options:**
- Ambush a raiding party (weaken warband)
- Infiltrate Skyshatter Spire (gather intelligence)
- Challenge Thaldrak directly (high risk, high reward)
- Discover WHY giants are raiding (bigger threat forcing them?)

**Investigation becomes REVENGE ARC:**
- Ian faces Storm Giants
- Discovers truth: Giants forced to raid by [bigger threat]
- Choice: Blind revenge or understand context?
- Resolution: Defeat Thaldrak, free enslaved people, learn bigger picture

**Twist Potential:**
- Giants raiding because their homeland is under attack
- Thaldrak is desperate, not evil
- Ian's village was collateral damage in larger war
- Moral complexity: Revenge vs. understanding

---

### DM Guidance: Ian's Investigation

**Session 2 (Meridian's Rest):**
- Tier 1 breadcrumbs available
- Thorne provides fatherly advice and practical lead (Korag)
- Validates revenge quest but counsels patience

**Session 3+ (Agastia):**
- Meet Korag, get intelligence on warband
- Decision point: When do we pursue giants?
- Builds toward mid-campaign showdown

**Giant Confrontation (Sessions 8-12?):**
- Major combat encounter
- Character arc resolution
- Moral complexity adds depth
- May tie to larger campaign threats (what drove giants to raid?)

---

## Universal DM Tools

### When Players Investigate But You're Not Ready

**Stalling Breadcrumbs (Use These Anytime):**
1. "You learn [rumor], but to find out more, you'd need to go to [location not yet prepared]"
2. "The NPC says they know someone who knows more, but they're in [distant city]"
3. "You find a partial clue, but it's incomplete. You need [specific resource/NPC] to decode it"
4. "The trail goes cold here, but [upcoming location] might have more information"

**Purpose:** Acknowledges player investigation, rewards with something, but defers full reveal until prepared

---

### Breadcrumb Escalation Chart

| Player Action | Location Tier | Breadcrumb Type | Result |
|--------------|---------------|-----------------|---------|
| Asks NPCs | Tier 1 (Anywhere) | Vague rumor | "Go to [place]" |
| Investigates locally | Tier 1 (Anywhere) | General direction | "Try [region]" |
| Researches in library | Tier 2 (Regional) | Specific location | "Go to [exact place]" |
| Talks to expert NPC | Tier 2 (Regional) | Named contacts | "Talk to [NPC]" |
| Reaches destination | Tier 3 (At Location) | Full investigation | 3-3-3-1 structure |
| Completes investigation | Resolution | Revelation + Next hook | New mystery opens |

---

## Integration with Session 2

### How to Use These Breadcrumbs

**During Downtime in Meridian's Rest:**
- Players can ask about their investigations
- Tier 1 breadcrumbs freely available
- Tier 2 breadcrumbs unlock via Thorne (after trust earned)

**Example Session Flow:**
1. Kyle asks about Geist → "He's in Agastia docks" (Tier 1)
2. Manny asks about artifacts → "Scholars in Agastia know more" (Tier 1)
3. Josh shows markings to Thorne → "I've seen those at Thunder Spire ruins" (Tier 2)
4. Nikki asks about temporal magic → "Underdark has strange people" (Tier 1)
5. Ian asks about giants → "Talk to Korag in Agastia" (Tier 2 via Thorne)
6. Party completes Quest 3 → Garrek's journal provides Tier 2 for Manny + Nikki

**Result:** Every PC has a lead to follow in future sessions, feels progress on personal arcs

---

## Version History

- **1.0.0** (2025-10-18): Initial breadcrumb system design for player-driven investigations

---

**Design Philosophy:** Players should never feel stuck. Every investigation attempt yields something - even if it's just "you need to go to [place] to learn more." Breadcrumbs build anticipation and reward proactive play without forcing premature revelations.
