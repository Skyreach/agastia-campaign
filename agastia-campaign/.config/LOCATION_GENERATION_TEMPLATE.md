## Sensory Description Template

### Entrance Script

> [Sound cue] draws you into [space type] illuminated by [lighting feature]. [Environmental spectacle description]. [Beckoning feature] beckons you with [scent/sensation]. [Hidden detail reveals deeper feature].

**Example (Garrek's Falls):**
> The sound of rushing water draws you into a cavern illuminated by flashing streaks of light that play among gravity-defying streams of water. Fed by the roaring torrent crashing through a hole in the ceiling of the cavern, a crystalline pool below beckons you with the sweet scent of lavender and honey. Flashes of coloured light briefly illuminate the depths of the pool, revealing a glimmering bottom of white sand.
