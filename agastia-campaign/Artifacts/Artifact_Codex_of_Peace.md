---

- Prevents intentional evil acts or harm within the zone
- Cannot be removed from pedestal without specific keyword
- Attempting removal triggers catastrophic explosion

## DM Notes

### Artifact Properties

**Protection Aura (Book of Peace Effect):**
- Zone of protection centered on Garrek's Falls cavern
- Creatures cannot enter with intent to cause harm
- Those within cannot intentionally perform evil acts or cause harm
- Functions as sanctuary for the Temporal Bloodline Tribe

**Physical Properties:**
- Metal pages (7 total) bound in enchanted bindings
- Pages turn automatically without physical interaction
- Blue energy flows through glyphs inscribed on pages
- Magically bound to stone pedestal
- Produces soft metallic "clink" sound as pages turn

**Removal Mechanics:**
- Requires specific keyword to safely remove
- Keyword known only to Temporal Bloodline elders
- Attempted removal without keyword triggers explosion

### Explosion Consequences

**Immediate Effects:**
1. Book bindings remain intact on pedestal
2. 7 metal pages transform into pure blue energy
3. Energy pages scatter through cavern walls
4. Energy travels up Garrek's Falls waterfall
5. Pages escape into Underdark tunnels (7 different directions)

**Lingering Connection:**
- Book bindings still magically connected to pages
- Successful Arcana check (DC 18) reveals directional pull toward each page
- Bindings can be used as divination focus to track scattered pages

**Zone Consequences:**
1. **Protection Lost:** Book of Peace aura immediately collapses
2. **Structural Damage:** Shockwave crumbles sections of cavern walls
3. **Underdark Breach:** Crumbling walls reveal passages to deeper Underdark
4. **Pond Degradation:** Magical healing waters lose potency over 2d4 weeks
5. **Temporal Bloodline Exposed:** Tribe loses sanctuary protection

### Quest Hook: Fragment Recovery

**Fetch Quest Structure:**
- 7 scattered pages transformed to energy fragments
- Each fragment traveled in different direction through Underdark
- Book bindings act as compass pointing toward fragments
- Fragments must be recovered and restored to reform Codex
- Restoration requires ritual knowledge from Temporal Bloodline

## Location: Garrek's Falls

### Discovery & Secrecy

**Historical Context:**
- Discovered by Garrek (deep gnome explorer) ~170 years ago
- Hard to find, location kept secret
- Historians and healers throughout Underdark know of it
- Actively work to conceal its existence

**Why Secrecy?**
- Water has incredible healing properties
- Also one of most addictive substances on planet
- Knowledge brings desperation (can heal, regrow limbs, raise dead)

### Sensory Description

**Entrance:**
> The sound of rushing water draws you into a cavern illuminated by flashing streaks of light that play among gravity-defying streams of water. Fed by the roaring torrent crashing through a hole in the ceiling of the cavern, a crystalline pool below beckons you with the sweet scent of lavender and honey. Flashes of coloured light briefly illuminate the depths of the pool, revealing a glimmering bottom of white sand.

**Features:**
- **Sound:** Rushing water, roaring torrent from ceiling
- **Visual:** Flashing colored lights, gravity-defying water streams
- **Scent:** Lavender and honey
- **Pool:** Crystalline water, white sand bottom
- **Lighting:** Intermittent colored flashes illuminating depths

### Mechanics

**Passive Healing Aura:**
- Any creature entering cavern gains continuous *lesser restoration* effect
- Effect carried by moisture in the air
- DC 14 Intelligence (Medicine) check to identify source/cause

**Hidden Danger:**
- DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals skeletal remains in pool's white sand
- Remains are victims of water's addictive properties

### Key Danger: "Just One Sip"

**Addictive Properties:**
- Most significant danger and greatest treasure
- Any creature consuming water must make DC 12 Wisdom saving throw
- **On Failure:** Becomes addicted, compelled to enter pool and drink until drowning
- **Cure:** *Remove curse* or *greater restoration* spell

### Potential Boon

**Single Draught of Garrek's Falls Water:**
- Regrows lost limbs
- Restores all lost hit points
- Cures any mundane disease
- Raises creature from death (if dead less than 72 hours)

**Risk vs. Reward:**
- Incredible healing power
- Extreme addiction risk (DC 12 Wisdom save)
- Pool contains skeletal remains of previous addicts
