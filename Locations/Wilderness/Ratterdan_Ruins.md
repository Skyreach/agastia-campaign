# Ratterdan Ruins

## Player Summary

Ratterdan was once a thriving frontier settlement on the edge of the Infinite Forest. Now it lies in ruins, destroyed by forces that left a massive smoking crater at its center and reality-bending phenomena throughout the area. The most striking feature is a giant's axe embedded in the crater's center, radiating stabilizing energy that keeps the worst of the forest's chaos at bay.

### The Destruction

The settlement was destroyed catastrophically and recently enough that smoke still rises from the central crater. Buildings are collapsed or burned, vegetation grows in impossible patterns, and the boundary between reality and Feywild is dangerously thin throughout the ruins.

Most strikingly, leaves and debris in the area fall upward into the sky rather than down to the ground - a clear sign of severe reality distortion.

### The Giant's Axe

At the crater's heart, a massive axe of obvious giant make stands embedded point-down in the earth. The weapon is sized for a creature at least fifteen feet tall, crafted from an unusual metal that seems to drink in light. Despite the chaos around it, the axe radiates an aura of stability and order.

Strange runes cover the axe's head and haft - symbols that match inscriptions found in Agastia's Scholar Quarter and on Josh's body. The axe seems to be holding the reality distortion at bay; approaching it causes the upward-falling leaves to hesitate and swirl uncertainly.

### Dangerous Phenomena

**Fey Pocket Dimension**
The entire ruin exists partially in a Fey pocket dimension. Time flows inconsistently, emotions run more intense than normal, and spoken words carry unusual weight. Promises made here become binding in ways they wouldn't elsewhere.

**Unstable Terrain**
Structures might collapse without warning. Ground that seems solid could give way. Distances change based on intention rather than physical space. Navigation is extremely difficult.

**Upward-Falling Objects**
Anything not secured falls upward into the sky and disappears. This includes dropped items, loose debris, and potentially people if they lose their footing. Only the area immediately around the giant's axe seems exempt from this effect.

**Temporal Distortion**
Time doesn't flow consistently. Parties might experience hours while minutes pass outside, or age rapidly in pockets of accelerated time.

### Exploration Opportunities

Despite the dangers, the ruins contain:
- Salvageable goods from destroyed buildings
- Clues about what happened to Ratterdan
- The giant's axe itself - a potentially powerful artifact
- Evidence of Fey activity and possibly cult involvement
- Hints about the forest's expansion and reality distortions

## DM Notes

### The Truth About Ratterdan's Fall

**What Happened**
Ratterdan was destroyed when a convergence between the material plane and Feywild became catastrophically unstable. The settlement was conducting research into the boundary phenomena (sponsored by certain Merit Council academics) when their experiments triggered a reality collapse.

The giant's axe was thrown by a Fey giant from the other side of the boundary - not to attack but to stabilize the convergence before it consumed a larger area. The axe acts as a reality anchor, preventing total collapse but leaving the ruins permanently distorted.

**The Research**
Merit Council scholars in Ratterdan were studying:
- Ways to push back the Infinite Forest's expansion
- Ancient magical systems related to boundary maintenance
- The symbols found throughout the region (the same ones on Josh)
- Reality manipulation techniques from pre-Council civilizations

Their research materials remain scattered throughout the ruins, valuable to multiple factions.

**Survivors**
Most of Ratterdan's population died in the collapse. A few escaped but carry psychological and sometimes physical scars from reality distortion exposure. Some survivors have developed strange abilities or knowledge as side effects.

The expedition leader, Scholar Vex Morraine, disappeared entirely during the collapse. Whether she's dead, lost in the Feywild, or transformed into something else remains unknown.

### The Giant's Axe - Full Details

**True Nature**
The axe is an artifact created by Fey giants who serve as boundary wardens between worlds. It's designed to stabilize convergence points and maintain separation between reality frameworks.

**Powers (When Attuned)**
- Stabilizes reality distortions in the wielder's vicinity
- Deals massive damage to creatures native to other planes
- Allows limited control over spatial relationships
- Provides resistance to reality-warping effects
- Enables bearer to sense boundary weaknesses

**Attunement Requirements**
Requires understanding of the runic symbols covering it. Josh, with matching symbols on his body, would find attunement significantly easier than others. Attempting attunement without this understanding triggers severe magical backlash.

**Faction Interest**
- **Merit Council:** Wants to study and control it for forest defense
- **Chaos Cult:** Seeks to corrupt or destroy it to accelerate chaos
- **Fey Entities:** Some want it returned; others want it to remain
- **Professor Zero:** Sees it as key to understanding the Codex's reality manipulation

### Session 1 Encounter Design

**Arrival Scene**
The party first glimpses the ruins from a distance - smoke rising, leaves falling upward, the unnatural quality immediately apparent. Approaching requires courage and careful navigation.

**Initial Exploration**
Safe exploration is possible in areas near the giant's axe where reality is more stable. Outer areas become increasingly dangerous. This creates natural progression - parties must venture further from safety for better loot and information.

**Specific Encounters**

*Corrupted Wildlife*
Fey-touched animals (wolves, bears, or similar) that attack with unnatural coordination and abilities. Not overtly magical but clearly wrong.

*Minor Fey*
Mischievous sprites or pixies who try to bargain, trick, or lead the party astray. Can be negotiated with if parties understand Fey protocols.

*Chaos Cultists*
A small cult scouting team investigating the axe. They'll fight if discovered but might flee to report to superiors. Capturing them provides intelligence.

*The Temporal Loop*
A section of ruins where the same moment repeats endlessly. A ghostly figure (Ratterdan citizen) relives their final terrified moments. Breaking the loop requires understanding what happened.

*The Collapsing Structure*
A partially intact building contains valuable research materials but is structurally unsound. Loud noises or magic use could trigger collapse.

**The Axe Discovery**
Finding and approaching the giant's axe should be a significant moment. The area around it feels more real and stable than anywhere else in the ruins. The choice of what to do with it becomes a major decision with long-term consequences.

### Key Discoveries

**Research Notes**
Scattered documents reveal:
- Ratterdan was studying boundary phenomena
- They discovered connections to ancient pre-Council magic
- Their work was both funded and monitored by Merit Council
- Something went catastrophically wrong during a test

**The Boundary Stones**
One of the ancient boundary stones stands near the ruins, its magic failed or deliberately disabled. The symbols match those on the giant's axe.

**Evidence of Cult Activity**
Signs that Chaos Cult members have been investigating the ruins recently. They're searching for something specific.

**Survivor's Journal**
A diary from a researcher detailing the final days before collapse. Mentions Scholar Vex Morraine's obsession with a "Codex connection" and increasingly reckless experiments.

**The Fey Perspective**
If parties can communicate with Fey entities in the ruins, they learn that the destruction was partly accident and partly consequence of "mortals meddling with forces they couldn't understand."

### Long-Term Consequences

**The Axe's Fate**
Whatever parties decide about the giant's axe affects:
- Future encounters with Fey entities
- Merit Council's response to the party
- Chaos Cult's interest in the party
- The Infinite Forest's expansion rate
- Josh's development (the symbols connect him to its power)

**Ratterdan's Legacy**
The ruins become a recurring location:
- Source of valuable research materials
- Meeting point for covert activities
- Site for rituals (cult or otherwise)
- Access point to deep Feywild territories
- Place of pilgrimage for those studying boundary magic

**Political Fallout**
Knowledge of what happened at Ratterdan could:
- Embarrass Merit Council officials
- Prove Chaos Cult warnings about experimentation
- Vindicate or condemn various researchers
- Influence policy on forest expansion
- Affect funding for magical research

### Secret Hooks for Later

**Scholar Vex Morraine Lives**
She survived in the Feywild and has become something other than fully human. She possesses crucial knowledge about the Codex and reality manipulation. Finding and extracting her becomes a major quest.

**The Failed Experiment**
What Ratterdan attempted was actually on the right track. Their research, if completed safely, could control the forest expansion. But doing so requires resources and knowledge scattered across multiple locations.

**The Fey Giant**
The giant who threw the axe to save the region is now trapped in the material plane, separated from their weapon. They seek its return but can't reach it without help. They could become an unusual ally or complication.

**The Boundary Stone Network**
Ratterdan's stone is one of many forming a network around the entire Infinite Forest. Understanding and reactivating this network could be key to containing the Fey expansion - but doing so requires finding and activating all the stones while various factions compete for control.
