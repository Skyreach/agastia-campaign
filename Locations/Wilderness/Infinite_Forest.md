# Infinite Forest

## Player Summary

The Infinite Forest forms the northern border of [[Agastia Region]], a vast woodland where reality grows thin and the Feywild bleeds through. The forest earned its name from travelers who swear it's larger inside than outside, with paths that loop impossibly and distances that refuse to stay consistent. The [[Merit Council]] built their great Northern Wall specifically to contain threats emerging from these woods.

### Distinctive Phenomena

**The Colored Wisps**
Glowing lights in various colors drift through the forest - blue, green, violet, gold. Local wisdom warns against following them, as they lead travelers astray or into danger. Some wisps seem curious and harmless; others are clearly predatory or malicious.

**Spatial Anomalies**
Distances don't work properly in the Infinite Forest. A clearing visible a few yards away might take hours to reach, or you might accidentally walk miles without noticing. Compasses spin uselessly. Only experienced guides know the reliable paths, and even those change periodically.

**Pocket Dimensions**
Small areas of the forest exist partially in the Feywild. These pockets follow Fey rules rather than natural laws - time flows differently, emotions intensify, promises become binding contracts, and lies can manifest physically. Travelers might not realize they've entered a pocket until strange things begin happening.

**Upward-Falling Leaves**
In certain areas, leaves and seeds fall upward into the sky rather than down to the ground. This defiance of natural law marks locations where reality is particularly unstable and dangerous phenomena are likely.

### Flora & Fauna

**Strange Vegetation**
Trees grow in impossible configurations. Plants display intelligence or awareness. Flowers bloom in colors that hurt to look at. Thorns appear where none existed moments before. Some areas contain vegetation from the Feywild that doesn't follow natural biology.

**Fey Creatures**
Pixies, sprites, and other minor Fey inhabit many areas. Most are capricious rather than malicious, but their pranks can be dangerous. Interactions follow Fey rules of bargaining, courtesy, and deal-making.

**Corrupted Wildlife**
Animals exposed to prolonged Fey influence develop strange features or behaviors. Some become intelligent and speaking. Others grow aggressive and territorial. Natural instincts become exaggerated or inverted.

**Monsters**
The forest harbors various dangerous creatures: displaced beasts, aberrations attracted to reality distortions, and things that slipped through from the Feywild and can't return.

### Navigation
Traveling through the Infinite Forest without a guide is extremely dangerous. Those attempting it should:
- Mark their path carefully (though marks sometimes move or disappear)
- Travel during daylight when possible
- Avoid following any wisps or mysterious sounds
- Never accept food, drink, or bargains from Fey creatures
- Turn back immediately if leaves begin falling upward

Local guides charge high fees but significantly improve survival odds. Even with guides, unexpected complications occur frequently.

## DM Notes

### The Forest's Nature

**Fey Border Zone**
The Infinite Forest sits on a thin boundary between the material plane and the Feywild. This barrier has weakened over centuries, allowing increasing bleed-through. Some force or entity on the Fey side appears to be pushing against the boundary deliberately.

**Active Expansion**
The forest is slowly growing, consuming farmland and settlements at its edges. The expansion isn't consistent - some areas remain stable while others advance rapidly. Ratterdan's destruction may have been related to this expansion, though the details remain mysterious.

**Reality Manipulation**
The forest's spatial anomalies result from competing reality frameworks. Material plane physics fight Feywild rules, creating unpredictable outcomes. Those who understand this conflict can potentially manipulate it.

**The Chaos Connection**
The [[Chaos Cult]] sees the Infinite Forest as proof that order is temporary and chaos inevitable. They study the forest's phenomena and seek ways to accelerate the Fey bleed-through. Some cultists conduct rituals in the forest depths.

### Secret Locations

**The Boundary Stones**
Ancient standing stones mark the original forest edge from before the expansion began. Inscribed with protective wards and stabilizing enchantments, most stones still stand but their magic is failing. The symbols match those found in [[Scholar Quarter]] and on [[Josh]]'s body.

**The Fey Courts**
Within deep pockets exist small courts of Fey nobility. These beings play complex games of politics, territory, and bargaining. They're aware of the material world but view it primarily as a source of entertainment and resources.

**The Convergence Points**
Specific locations where the barrier between worlds is thinnest. Here, travelers can slip fully into the Feywild (often without realizing it until too late). Some convergence points are stable and predictable; others appear randomly.

**[[Ratterdan Ruins]]**
The destroyed settlement lies deep in the forest, surrounded by particularly intense reality distortions. The giant axe found there pulses with power that seems to stabilize the area around it - suggesting it might be a key to understanding or controlling the forest.

**The Warden's Grove**
A legendary location where an entity called the Warden supposedly maintains the barrier between worlds. Some say the Warden is failing or has abandoned their post. Finding the Grove is notoriously difficult.

### Key NPCs & Entities

**The Wandering Guide, Moss**
A taciturn half-elf ranger who knows the safe paths through the forest. Charges fair rates and keeps clients alive, but volunteers no information beyond the basics. Has some kind of arrangement with certain Fey entities.

**Lady Shimmerwind**
A Fey noble whose pocket dimension includes a beautiful glade. She entertains visitors graciously but all her hospitality comes with prices and conditions. Very interested in mortal emotions and stories.

**The Whisperer**
An entity heard but never seen that offers guidance to lost travelers. The guidance is accurate but following it incurs a debt that the Whisperer will eventually collect. No one knows what the Whisperer actually is or wants.

**The Cult of Wild Growth**
A [[Chaos Cult]] cell that operates from a camp deep in the forest. They believe the Fey expansion represents natural chaos reasserting itself and work to accelerate it through rituals and sabotage of boundary protections.

**The Forest Itself**
Some believe the forest has developed a form of collective consciousness. Whether this is true or just pattern-seeking in chaos is debatable, but sometimes the forest seems to react intentionally to events or people.

### Dangers

**Spatial Distortion**
Parties can become hopelessly lost, walk for days getting nowhere, or accidentally cover dangerous distances instantly.

**Fey Bargains**
Accepting deals without understanding full implications. Fey interpretation of agreements differs from mortal assumptions.

**Reality Instability**
Areas where physics doesn't work properly. Magic becomes unpredictable. Natural healing might not function. Senses provide false information.

**Pocket Dimensions**
Accidentally entering Fey space where time flows differently. Hours in the forest might be days outside, or vice versa.

**Hostile Entities**
Predatory Fey, corrupted wildlife, monsters from the Feywild, and [[Chaos Cult]] fanatics all pose physical threats.

**Psychological Effects**
Extended forest exposure affects mental state. Paranoia, confusion, heightened emotions, compulsive behaviors, and false memories all possible.

### Resources
The forest contains valuable resources for those willing to risk harvesting them:
- Fey-touched materials with magical properties
- Rare herbs and reagents
- Access to Fey markets and bargaining
- Knowledge from ancient sites
- Understanding of reality manipulation

However, all resources come with risks and often hidden costs.
