# Blackwater Bridge

## Player Summary

**Blackwater Bridge** is a strategic stone bridge spanning the Blackwater River, a major waterway in the region. The bridge is the primary crossing point for trade and military movements, making it a valuable and contested location. The river's dark, tannin-stained water gives both bridge and river their name.

### Overview
- **Type:** Strategic bridge / landmark
- **Structure:** Large stone bridge, ancient construction
- **Spans:** Blackwater River (wide, deep, difficult to ford)
- **Strategic Value:** Critical trade and military route
- **Control:** [[Merit Council]] garrison at each end
- **Toll:** Required for commercial traffic
- **Status:** Active, player-created during Session 0

## Description (To Be Developed)

**The Bridge:**
- Ancient stone construction (pre-dates [[Agastia]])
- 200+ feet long, 20 feet wide
- Three support arches over dark water
- Stone railings worn by centuries of use
- Defensive towers at each end (garrison posts)

**The River:**
- Called "Blackwater" for dark, tannin-stained appearance
- Deep and swift-flowing (dangerous to cross)
- Few other crossing points for miles
- Important trade waterway
- Fishing boats and barges use river

**Fortifications:**
- North tower: [[Merit Council]] garrison (10-20 soldiers)
- South tower: Toll collection and customs inspection
- Watchtowers can signal along trade route
- Defensible position in wartime
- Emergency portcullis can seal bridge

## Strategic Importance

**Military Value:**

- Choke point for armies
- Historically contested in conflicts
- Would be primary target in war

**Political Control:**
- [[Merit Council]] maintains garrison

- Denial of access punishes enemies
- Symbol of authority
