# [[Agastia]] - The Merit City

## Player Summary

[[Agastia]] is the gleaming capital of the [[Merit Council]]'s domain, a city where your worth is measured by your achievements rather than your birth. The city rises in tiers and districts, each reflecting different aspects of the meritocratic ideal. Imposing giant stone statues of ancient heroes watch over the streets, and the massive Northern Wall protects the city from threats emerging from the [[Infinite Forest]].

### Distinctive Features

**The Giant Stone Statues**
Enormous statues of legendary figures stand throughout the city, their origins lost to time. Some claim they predate the Merit Council itself. The statues depict warriors, scholars, and leaders frozen in moments of triumph.

**The Northern Wall**
A massive fortification protecting [[Agastia]] from threats from the [[Infinite Forest]]. Guard towers dot the wall, and [[Merit Council]] soldiers maintain constant vigilance.

**Airship Docks**
Magical airships connect [[Agastia]] to distant cities, serving as both transportation and symbols of the Council's technological achievement. The docks are a marvel of engineering perched on the city's upper tiers.

**The Three-Generation Rule**
Families can maintain their merit status for up to three generations before descendants must re-prove themselves through testing. This prevents hereditary privilege while allowing some stability.

### City Districts

[[Agastia]] is organized into 9 major districts spread across 7 tiers. Districts in higher tiers offer more fantastical and magical services, while lower tiers provide practical, survival-focused options.

## DM Notes

### Hidden Truths

**The [[Chaos Cult]]'s Presence**
Multiple [[Chaos Cult]] cells operate within the city, particularly recruiting among the [[Dispossessed]]. [[Professor Zero]] has infiltrated the cult to monitor their activities, though his true allegiance remains ambiguous.

**The Ancient Statues**
The giant stone statues are actually dormant constructs from a pre-Council civilization. They can be awakened under specific conditions - knowledge the [[Chaos Cult]] actively seeks.

**The Inverse Tower**
The tower extends thirteen levels beneath the surface, with the deepest levels containing sealed artifacts and forbidden knowledge from before the Merit Council's rise.

**The Three-Generation Rule**
Originally designed to prevent dynasties, the rule now creates a class of "generational decline" families desperately trying to maintain status. This desperation makes them vulnerable to cult recruitment.
