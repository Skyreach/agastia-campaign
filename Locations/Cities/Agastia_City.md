# Agastia - The Merit City

## Player Summary

Agastia is the gleaming capital of the Merit Council's domain, a city where your worth is measured by your achievements rather than your birth. The city rises in tiers and districts, each reflecting different aspects of the meritocratic ideal. Imposing giant stone statues of ancient heroes watch over the streets, and the massive Northern Wall protects the city from threats emerging from the Infinite Forest.

### Distinctive Features

**The Giant Stone Statues**
Enormous statues of legendary figures stand throughout the city, their origins lost to time. Some claim they predate the Merit Council itself. The statues depict warriors, scholars, and leaders frozen in moments of triumph.

**The Northern Wall**
A massive fortification protecting Agastia from threats from the Infinite Forest. Guard towers dot the wall, and Merit Council soldiers maintain constant vigilance.

**Airship Docks**
Magical airships connect Agastia to distant cities, serving as both transportation and symbols of the Council's technological achievement. The docks are a marvel of engineering perched on the city's upper tiers.

**The Three-Generation Rule**
Families can maintain their merit status for up to three generations before descendants must re-prove themselves through testing. This prevents hereditary privilege while allowing some stability.

### City Districts

**Scholar Quarter**
Libraries, universities, testing centers, and academic institutions fill this district. Endless debates echo from coffee houses, and students hurry between lectures. Strange symbols adorn many buildings - Josh recognizes similar markings on his own body.

**Merchant District**
The commercial heart of Agastia, where goods from across the realm change hands. Includes Brightcoin Emergency Supplies (the party's starting equipment source) and countless other shops and services. Nikki's parents run a popular Italian restaurant here.

**Government Complex**
The seat of Merit Council power, featuring the famous Inverse Tower that extends downward into the earth rather than skyward. Council chambers, bureaucratic offices, and official testing facilities dominate the area.

### Social Structure

**Merit Rankings**
Citizens carry official documentation of their qualifications, achievements, and merit level. Higher ranks provide better housing, services, and opportunities. Testing centers offer chances for advancement.

**The Dispossessed**
Those who failed testing, refuse to participate, or cannot meet merit standards. They occupy the lower districts and harbor growing resentment toward the system.

**Common Services**
- Libraries (public access to knowledge)
- Testing centers (opportunities for advancement)
- Training facilities (skill development)
- Merchant guilds (certified quality goods)
- Temples (approved religious practices)

## DM Notes

### Hidden Truths

**The Chaos Cult's Presence**
Multiple Chaos Cult cells operate within the city, particularly recruiting among the Dispossessed. Professor Zero has infiltrated the cult to monitor their activities, though his true allegiance remains ambiguous.

**The Ancient Statues**
The giant stone statues are actually dormant constructs from a pre-Council civilization. They can be awakened under specific conditions - knowledge the Chaos Cult actively seeks.

**The Inverse Tower**
The tower extends thirteen levels beneath the surface, with the deepest levels containing sealed artifacts and forbidden knowledge from before the Merit Council's rise.

**The Three-Generation Rule**
Originally designed to prevent dynasties, the rule now creates a class of "generational decline" families desperately trying to maintain status. This desperation makes them vulnerable to cult recruitment.
