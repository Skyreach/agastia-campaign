# Sawbones Surgery

## Overview

**Type & Specialty:** Barber-surgeon and medical services - cheap, dangerous medieval medicine with no questions asked

**Location:** [[Dock District]] (Tier 6), tucked in a back alley near the Rusty Anchor Tavern, above a pawn shop

**Clientele:** Dock workers, sailors, laborers, criminals, anyone who can't afford proper healing or needs discretion

**Reputation:** "He's drunk, but he's cheap." Known for treating anyone regardless of ability to pay or legality of their situation. Risky procedures but better than bleeding out in an alley.

**Atmosphere:** Cramped, poorly-lit room that reeks of cheap whiskey, blood, and antiseptic herbs. Surgical tools (saws, knives, pliers) hang on walls or sit in questionable cleanliness. Stained operating table in center. Doc Harrow's hands shake until he's had a drink - then they steady considerably. Groans from recovering patients in the back room. A medical chart on the wall shows humors and bloodletting points (medieval nonsense).

## Proprietor

**Doc Harrow** - Human male, late 40s, former ship's surgeon

**Personality:**
- Functional alcoholic - steady hands when properly drunk
- Compassionate despite circumstances - treats everyone, payment optional
- Cynical about the world but soft-hearted with patients
- Repository of medical secrets - knows half the district's injuries and ailments

**Appearance:** Graying hair, perpetual stubble, bloodshot eyes, stained apron over simple clothes. Smells of whiskey and medicinal herbs. Calloused, scarred hands that shake until he takes a drink. Surprisingly steady once he's had his "medicine."

**Motivation:** Lost his position as ship's surgeon to alcoholism. Now trying to do some good for people who, like him, have fallen through the cracks. Believes everyone deserves medical care, even if it's risky care.

**Secret:** Knows medical secrets about half the [[Dock District]] - who's been stabbed, who's pregnant, who's sick with something contagious. This information could be valuable to the right (or wrong) people.

**Quest Hook - The Infection Outbreak:**
- **Need:** Five of Doc's recent patients have developed the same unusual infection. He's terrified it's his fault - contaminated tools, bad technique, something worse. The infection isn't responding to normal treatment and is spreading.
- **Problem:** Doc needs someone to investigate quietly. If word gets out that his surgery is causing infections, he'll lose the trust of the district (and possibly his life). But if this is something contagious or deliberate, people need to know.
- **Reward:** In exchange for investigating and solving the infection source:
  - Free medical services for life (still risky, but free)
  - Introduction to information network (Doc knows everyone's secrets)
  - Access to his medical knowledge (advantage on Medicine checks when consulting him)
  - Discrete medical care with no record or questions (useful for criminals/fugitives)
- **Difficulty:** Moderate - Requires investigation, possibly dealing with disease or deliberate poisoning. May involve criminal elements or supernatural causes. Time pressure as more people get infected.

## Day-to-Day Operations

**Hours:**
- Irregular (whenever someone needs him, day or night)
- Usually awake afternoons/evenings (sleeping off morning drinking)
- Emergency cases wake him up at any hour
- Busiest after bar fights and dock accidents

**Typical Day:**
- Morning: Recovering from previous night, shaky and unreliable
- Afternoon: "Medicating" himself, becomes functional around 2pm
- Evening: Prime working hours, steady hands, most surgeries performed
- Night: Emergency cases, drunk patients from tavern brawls

**Regular Customers:**
- **Dock workers:** Work injuries, crushed limbs, rope burns, infections
- **Sailors:** Returning from voyages with tropical diseases, scurvy, broken bones
- **Criminals:** Stab wounds, no questions asked
- **Poor laborers:** Can't afford real healers or temples
- **Desperate cases:** People with no other options

**Real Uses:**
- **Cheap Medical Care:** Better than nothing when temples cost too much
- **No Questions Asked:** Treats criminals, fugitives, illegal immigrants
- **Information Broker:** Doc knows everyone's medical secrets (for the right price)
- **Emergency Stabilization:** Can keep someone alive long enough to get real healing
- **Unusual Surgery:** Removing implanted objects, foreign bodies, parasites

- Cheap healing alternative when party is broke
- No-questions-asked surgery for removing tracking devices, curses, implants
- Witness to crimes through treating victims and perpetrators
- Source of information about diseases, poisons, unusual injuries in district

**Personality Quirks:**
- Hands shake until he's had exactly three drinks - then perfectly steady
- Keeps detailed medical notes in illegible handwriting (drunk scrawl)
- Talks to patients constantly during surgery (nerves or habit from ship duty)
- Has soft spot for children - treats them for free, gentler procedures

- Recognizes torture wounds versus accident injuries
- Understands how certain criminal organizations mark their victims

**Information Doc Knows:**
- Half the district's medical history
- Who's pregnant (and who the father might not be)
- Who's been stabbed recently (and probably why)
- Who's sick with something contagious
- Who's been poisoned or drugged
- Who has old scars from interesting places

**Using Doc Harrow in Campaigns:**
- Information broker who trades medical secrets for favors
- Emergency healing when temples are unavailable or too expensive
- Remove magical tracking devices or implanted objects
- Investigate medical mysteries (unusual diseases, poisonings, curses)
- Witness to criminal activity through treating victims
- Moral dilemma: help him stay sober (lose effectiveness) or enable drinking (better surgery but ethical concerns)

**Infection Mechanics:**
- After any treatment at Sawbones, roll d100
- 1-25: Infection develops in 1 week (DC 12 Con save or take 1d6 damage per day until treated)
- 26-100: No infection
- Proper medical treatment (Medicine DC 15) or lesser restoration cures infection

**Doc's Sobriety Levels:**
- **Stone Sober:** Shaking hands, disadvantage on Medicine checks, refuses complex surgery
- **Three Drinks (Optimal):** Steady hands, normal Medicine checks (+5 modifier)
- **Drunk:** Slurred speech but still functional, no mechanical change
- **Blackout Drunk:** Won't perform surgery, too impaired (rare - he knows his limits)

- Medical chart showing "four humors" and bleeding points (medieval nonsense)
- Bucket for amputated limbs and extracted objects
- Surprisingly well-organized (Doc knows where everything is)
- Cat that keeps rats away from recovering patients

**Relationship with Merit System:**
- Doc was Tier 3-4 when he was ship's surgeon
- Fell to Tier 6 due to alcoholism and losing position
- Doesn't care about regaining status - just wants to help people
- Cynical about merit system ("Merit doesn't keep you from bleeding")
- Treats Tier 7 [[Dispossessed]] with same care as higher tiers

**Story Potential:**
- Doc might be the only witness to a murder (treated dying victim)
- Could identify poison used in assassination attempt
- Knows about pregnancy that could cause political scandal
- Has treated victims of human experimentation
- Discovers new disease that threatens the district
- Former crewmates might seek him out (for good or ill)
