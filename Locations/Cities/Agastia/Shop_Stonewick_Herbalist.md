# [[Stonewick Herbalist]]

## Overview

**Type & Specialty:** Non-magical healing and herbal remedies - Affordable poultices, salves, antitoxins, and folk medicine passed through generations

**Location:** [[Lower Residential District]] (Tier 5), corner shop near the community well, ground floor of converted residential building

**Clientele:** Working-class families, laborers who can't afford magical healing, elderly seeking traditional remedies, those distrustful of magic

**Reputation:** "Nessa's herbs saved my daughter's life when we couldn't afford the temple." Beloved community institution where healing isn't luxury - it's care. Known for grandmother's wisdom and remedies that actually work.

**Atmosphere:** Warm and welcoming like visiting grandmother's kitchen. Dried herbs hanging from ceiling beams, clay pots lining shelves, mortar and pestle on worn wooden counter. Smells of chamomile, lavender, and something earthy being ground. Small hearth always has kettle brewing. Cluttered but clean. Everything has its place from decades of habit.

## Proprietor

### Nessa Stonewick
**Role:** Proprietor, healer, and community grandmother
**Faction:** None officially (Disposition: Quietly supports community strength against chaos)

**Background:**
- Tier 5 resident for seventy years, born in this district
- Learned herbalism from her grandmother, who learned from hers - unbroken lineage of healers
- Raised six children (three still in [[Agastia]], two moved to farms, one died in plague twenty years ago)
- Fourteen grandchildren scattered across the city
- Survived chaos cult's early activities by strengthening community bonds
- Taught Medicine skill to dozens of locals over the years (creates network of community healers)

**Goals:**

- Long-term: Ensure every family in Lower Residential has someone who knows basic first aid and herbal medicine (community resilience against disasters)

**Personality:**
- Warm and nurturing - treats every customer like family
- Perceptive about people's real problems (listens more than talks)
- Gentle but firm when patients resist needed treatment
- Sees through lies and pretense with grandmother's knowing eye
- Values community over profit (will extend credit indefinitely to neighbors in need)
- Patient teacher who explains why remedies work

**Appearance:** Halfling female, late 70s, silver hair in neat bun, perpetual flour on apron from morning baking, age-spotted hands never still (always grinding, mixing, or stirring). Warm brown eyes that crinkle when smiling (which is often). Sensible work dress, comfortable slippers. Moves deliberately but with practiced efficiency. Smells faintly of rosemary and honey.

**Interaction Hooks:**
- Would seek player help with: Gathering rare herbs from dangerous locations, investigating why certain plants are dying in region, protecting community members from threats, delivering medicine to quarantined areas
- Reluctance level: Initially cautious (protective of community), warms quickly if players show genuine care
- Can offer players: Affordable healing, Medicine training, community connections, safe house if hiding, adoption into neighborhood (valued protection)

**Party Connections:**
- Potential bonds with: Anyone with Medicine interest, characters with family values, those who appreciate folk wisdom over flashy magic

## DM Notes

### Plot Hooks

**The Dying Herbs:**
- Nessa's rooftop garden and wild herb patches suddenly dying
- Same herbs failing throughout region (not natural blight)
- Either environmental contamination or magical interference
- Without these herbs, Nessa can't make core remedies (community crisis)
- Investigation reveals pollution from Tier 2 alchemical facility or cult sabotage
- Reward: Community gratitude, permanent 50% discount, free Medicine training, adoption into neighborhood (safe houses, information network)
- Difficulty: Moderate (investigation, possible confrontation with polluter)

**The Quarantine:**
- Disease outbreak in [[Lower Residential District]]
- Authorities want to quarantine entire district (trap residents inside)
- Nessa needs help delivering medicine to sick, gathering supplies from outside
- Players must sneak through quarantine or negotiate with authorities
- Discover disease isn't natural (cult experiment or worse)
- Reward: Community hero status, Nessa's eternal gratitude, inside information on district activities, saved lives
- Difficulty: Moderate-High (disease exposure, authority confrontation, time pressure)

**The Lost Recipe:**
- Nessa's grandmother's recipe book stolen
- Contains generations of herbal knowledge (irreplaceable)
- Thief either doesn't understand value or specifically targeting community's healing ability
- Recipe book has notes about unusual herbs with magical properties (real target)
- Following trail reveals larger plot against [[Lower Residential District]]
- Reward: Copied recipes (valuable reference), Medicine proficiency training for half cost, community legend status
- Difficulty: Moderate (tracking thief, understanding motive, recovering book intact)

**The Apprentice's Choice:**
- Nessa's favorite grandchild offered prestigious Medical Academy position
- Would mean leaving district, abandoning family healing tradition
- Nessa won't interfere with grandchild's choice but is heartbroken
- Players might investigate Academy's true intentions or help negotiate compromise
- Reveals [[Merit Council]]'s interest in co-opting traditional knowledge
- Alternative: Help Nessa find different apprentice, ensuring tradition continues
- Reward: Deep personal connection with Nessa, understanding of Tier system's impact on families, potential apprentice ally
- Difficulty: Low-Moderate (social interaction, investigation, negotiation)

### Personality Quirks

- Always offers tea (has perfect memory for how people take it)
- Calls everyone "dear" or "love" regardless of age or status
- Hums old halfling folk songs while grinding herbs
- Keeps jar of honey candies for children (and stressed adults)
- Lectures patients about taking care of themselves (with genuine care)
- Remembers everyone's ailments and asks follow-up questions months later
- Refuses payment from children ("You'll pay me back when you're grown")
- Gardens aggressively (rooftop garden is her pride and joy)

### Secret Information

**The Family Legacy:**
- Stonewick family healing tradition spans 200+ years
- Original Stonewick was actually court herbalist who fled noble intrigue
- Brought medicinal knowledge usually reserved for wealthy
- Family deliberately chose to serve common people (philosophical choice)
- Recipe book contains techniques most healers don't know

**The Community Network:**
- Nessa quietly organizes mutual aid throughout district
- Network of families who watch each other's children, share food, provide emergency help
- This social fabric makes district resilient against cult infiltration
- Nessa's real anti-cult work: strengthening community so people look out for each other
- Council unaware they have powerful ally in preventing chaos

**The Medicinal Garden:**
- Rooftop garden contains some magically-potent herbs (Nessa doesn't realize)
- Growing naturally due to ley line intersection under building
- These herbs make her remedies unusually effective (why her reputation exceeds expectations)
- If discovered, could attract unwanted attention from alchemists, mages, or thieves
- Nessa attributes effectiveness to "grandmother's technique" (partially true)

**The Children She Lost:**
- One son died in plague twenty years ago
- Nessa couldn't save him despite all her knowledge (deepest regret)
- Drives her to ensure no family suffers what hers did
- Still keeps his childhood toy in shop (remembrance)
- Will do anything to prevent similar tragedy

**The Cult's Blind Spot:**
- Chaos cult attempted recruiting in Lower Residential multiple times
- Always failed because community members talk to each other
- Nessa's network ensures strangers offering "opportunities" get reported
- Cult frustrated by this "backward" district's resistance
- Nessa doesn't know she's thwarting them (thinks she's just building good community)
