# The Desperate's Refuge

## Overview

**Type & Specialty:** Unlicensed healing operation - bandaging, surgery, mystery tonics, and no-questions-asked medical care for those with nowhere else to turn

**Location:** [[The Depths]] (Tier 7), hidden chamber accessible through back alleys. Location changes periodically for safety. Must ask locals for current location.

**Clientele:** The desperate, the dispossessed, criminals, fugitives, those who can't afford licensed healers, anyone who needs healing without official scrutiny

**Reputation:** "It might kill you, but it's better than nothing." Last resort healing when you're dying and have no gold or can't risk official attention. Mother Cass will treat anyone, regardless of ability to pay.

**Atmosphere:** Dim lamplight casting shadows on rough stone walls. Smell of blood, herbs, alcohol, and unwashed bodies. Makeshift beds (pallets, old blankets). Bandages hang drying. Tonic bottles of questionable origin line shelves. People in various states of injury wait quietly. Despite conditions, there's a sense of sanctuary - Mother Cass's presence creates safety.

## Proprietor

**Mother Cass** - Human female, elderly (70s), background unclear and stories conflict

**Personality:**
- Compassionate despite harsh conditions - genuinely wants to help
- Protective of her patients - will kill to defend sanctuary if necessary
- Practical about her limitations - knows she's not a real healer
- Hopeful against all odds - maintains belief in community and kindness
- Mysterious about her past - deflects questions with gentle firmness

**Appearance:** Weathered face with deep wrinkles, kind but tired eyes, gray hair usually tied back, practical rough clothing (often bloodstained), surprisingly gentle hands despite rough work. Moves with quiet confidence. Always wears simple wooden pendant (unknown significance).

**Motivation:** To help those the city has abandoned. To prove that compassion matters even in the Depths. To protect the vulnerable and maintain hope. Possibly serving unknown divine purpose (though she denies any special power).

**Background Mystery:** No one knows Mother Cass's full story. Some say she was a noble who lost everything. Others claim she was a military medic. Some whisper she was a cleric who broke vows. A few believe she's actually divine-touched but hiding it. All stories agree on one thing - she chose to be here, helping the dispossessed.

**Secret (DM Only):** Mother Cass is a former Cleric of Ilmater (god of suffering and compassion) who broke from her order when they prioritized doctrine over helping people. She retains minor divine powers (can cast Cure Wounds 1/day, Spare the Dying at will) but only uses them in dire emergencies, claiming her hands are simply "lucky" or the patient "strong." Uses mundane methods deliberately to teach self-reliance and preserve her secret.

**Quest Hook - The Sanctuary Under Threat:**
- **Need:** Local gang wants to take over the Sanctuary chamber for smuggling operations. They've threatened Mother Cass - leave or be removed forcibly. She refuses to abandon her patients.
- **Problem:** Mother Cass won't fight (violates her principles except in direct defense). Gang will attack in 3 days. Sanctuary patients include children, elderly, and seriously wounded who can't be moved safely.
- **Reward:** In exchange for protecting the Sanctuary or negotiating peaceful solution:
  - Mother Cass's blessing (+1d4 to death saves, permanent)
  - Access to Sanctuary as safe house when needed (no questions asked)
  - Information network ([[The Depths]] residents trust Mother Cass and will share information)
  - Emergency healing (Mother Cass will use her secret divine powers once for party if truly desperate)
  - Introduction to Underground Railroad (can help move people secretly)
- **Difficulty:** Moderate to Hard - Gang has numbers and weapons. Negotiation requires convincing gang leader profit isn't worth angering entire Depths community. Violence risks collateral damage to patients.

## Day-to-Day Operations

**Hours:**
- Irregular (whenever someone needs help): Mother Cass sleeps in shifts
- Busiest at night (daytime injuries wait until dark for discretion)
- Sometimes unavailable (checking on patients, scavenging supplies, moving location)

**Typical Day:**
- Pre-dawn: Tend to overnight patients, change bandages, distribute bread
- Morning: Sleep briefly while trusted helper watches Sanctuary
- Afternoon: Scavenge for supplies (herbs, clean cloth, alcohol), check dead drops for donations
- Evening: Return to Sanctuary, prepare for night injuries
- Night: Treat new arrivals (gang fights, accidents, abuse victims, botched crimes)
- Ongoing: Mediate disputes, counsel desperate, protect vulnerable

**Regular Customers:**
- **Gang members:** Need treatment without official questions
- **Abuse victims:** Fleeing dangerous situations, need safe recovery
- **[[Dispossessed]] poor:** Can't afford licensed healers
- **Criminals:** Stabbed, beaten, poisoned - can't go to authorities
- **Refugees:** Hiding from various threats, need care while recovering
- **Children:** Injured in Depths, brought by frightened parents

**Real Uses:**
- **No-Questions Treatment:** Get healing without explaining how injury happened
- **Sanctuary:** Safe place to recover when pursued or threatened
- **Information:** Mother Cass hears everything - gang movements, official raids, community needs
- **Spiritual Counsel:** Mother Cass provides hope and wisdom when people are broken
- **Connection Point:** Access to Underground Railroad, community leaders, resistance members

- **Accommodations:** Rough pallet, thin blanket, shared space. Not comfortable but safe.

## DM Notes

**Plot Hooks:**
- Last-resort healing when party is desperate, broke, or avoiding official attention
- Sanctuary quest provides moral choice and combat/negotiation challenge
- Mother Cass can provide information about Depths, chaos cult activities, resistance movements
- Divine secret reveal creates dramatic moment and moral obligation
- Connection to Underground Railroad opens escape/smuggling storylines
- Patients include abuse victims, criminals, refugees - each with potential stories

**Personality Quirks:**
- Hums old hymns while working (doesn't realize she's doing it)
- Calls everyone "child" regardless of age
- Refuses payment from those who truly can't afford it (even 1sp)
- Keeps small shrine in Sanctuary (claims it's "for those who need it" but tends it daily)
- Never angry, even at attackers - just "disappointed in wasted potential"
- Has surprisingly strong grip despite appearing frail
- Sometimes says prayers over patients (claims it's "just habit")

**Mechanical Considerations:**
- Very risky healing - use when party is truly desperate
- Mystery tonics create gambling element (risk vs reward)
- Infection mechanics add consequences beyond immediate healing
- DC 15 Con saves are high - not guaranteed success even for healthy characters
- 1 sp bandages allow stabilization for poor/desperate characters without magic
- Sanctuary provides non-magical safe house when needed
- Mother Cass's secret abilities should only be revealed in truly dramatic moments

**Connection to Campaigns:**
- Gateway to Depths storylines (resistance, chaos cult, dispossessed)
- Demonstrates tier system consequences (those with merit get real healers)
- Provides moral complexity (helping criminals vs protecting vulnerable)
- Mother Cass's mystery background invites investigation
- Sanctuary defense quest creates community investment
- Divine secret reveal can lead to cleric-related storylines
- Information hub for underworld activities

**Themes:**
- Compassion in hopeless circumstances
- Choosing to help despite lacking resources
- Last resort vs no resort (better than nothing)
- Hidden divinity serving through humble means
- Community strength against exploitation
- Merit system failure (healing should not require wealth/status)

**Atmosphere Notes:**
- Emphasize contrast: grim conditions but warm humanity
- Mother Cass's presence makes unsafe space feel safe
- Lamplight creating pools of safety in darkness
- Quiet suffering met with quiet compassion
- Desperation balanced by hope
- Violence as last resort only (Mother Cass regrets necessary killings)

**Risk Warnings for Players:**
- Surgery has real risk of making things worse
- Mystery tonics might poison instead of heal
- Infection checks add delayed consequences
- Unsanitary conditions mean healing here is genuinely dangerous
- This is truly desperate last resort - use licensed healers if possible
- But sometimes desperate is all you have
