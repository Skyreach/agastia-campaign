# [[The Wanderer's Pack]]

## Overview

**Type & Specialty:** Adventuring supplies and outdoor equipment - everything needed for dungeon delving, wilderness travel, and dangerous expeditions

**Location:** [[Merchant District]] (Tier 4), main shopping boulevard near The Gilded Gryphon Inn

**Clientele:** Adventurers, mercenaries, explorers, hunters, caravan guards

**Reputation:** "If you're leaving the city walls, start here." Known for quality goods that won't fail when your life depends on them.

**Atmosphere:** Organized chaos. Rope coils hang from ceiling. Climbing gear, camping equipment, and weapon maintenance supplies displayed on walls and tables. Smells of leather oil, canvas, and metal polish. Always busy with adventurers preparing for journeys.

## Proprietor

**Kessa Ironfoot** - Dwarf female, early 50s, former adventurer (Retired Fighter)

**Personality:**
- No-nonsense professional - knows her inventory and won't sell junk
- Gruff but helpful - remembers every customer and what they bought
- Generous with advice for those who listen

**Appearance:** Muscular build, braided black beard with gray streaks, leather apron covered in pockets, missing two fingers on left hand (old adventuring injury). Practical clothing, heavy boots.

**Motivation:** Saw too many adventurers die from faulty equipment. Runs the shop her party would have wanted - honest prices, quality gear, solid advice.

**Quest Hook - The Defective Rope:**
- **Need:** Kessa sold climbing rope to an adventuring party two weeks ago. They died in a dungeon from rope failure. She's devastated and furious - the rope came from her new supplier and should have been tested.
- **Problem:** Kessa needs proof the supplier sold her defective goods knowingly. She suspects they're cutting corners to undercut competitors. Lives are at stake.
- **Reward:** In exchange for investigating the supplier and getting proof:
  - 20% permanent discount on all adventuring gear
  - First pick of any unusual items that come through the shop
  - Repair and maintenance services (rope, leather goods, simple weapons) free
  - Introduction to retired adventurers (potential hirelings or information sources)
- **Difficulty:** Moderate - Requires investigation and possibly confronting supplier. Supplier might have criminal connections. Evidence gathering essential.
