# Archive of Lost Histories

## Overview

**Type & Specialty:** The largest and most ancient repository of knowledge in [[Agastia]], focusing on forgotten lore, historical records, and obscure magical texts. Less a public library, more a secure research facility.

**Location:** [[Scholar Quarter]], [[Agastia]] (implied from the validation report)

**Clientele:** Primarily scholars, mages, historians, and those seeking very specific, often dangerous, knowledge. Access is restricted and requires credentials or special dispensation.

**Reputation:** A place of immense knowledge, but also of forgotten secrets and potential dangers. Rumors persist of wards and sentient magical defenses protecting its most valuable collections.

**Atmosphere:** Quiet, reverent, filled with the scent of aged parchment and dust. Towering shelves reach to a high, vaulted ceiling, dimly lit by enchanted lanterns that cast long shadows. The air hums with barely contained magical energies from ancient artifacts and spells.
