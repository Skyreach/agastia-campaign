# Stonemark Antiquities

## Overview

**Type & Specialty:** A cramped, dust-filled shop overflowing with ancient artifacts, strange curios, and forgotten relics from across Agastia and beyond. Mirella specializes in acquiring and identifying items of historical and magical significance.

**Location:** Merchant District, Agastia (likely a less prominent, perhaps slightly out-of-the-way street)

**Clientele:** Wealthy collectors, aspiring mages, historians, and adventurers seeking unique gear or lost knowledge. Mirella has a knack for finding what people don't even know they're looking for.

**Reputation:** Known for its eclectic and often valuable inventory, but also for Mirella's eccentricities and her steep, but fair, prices. Rumors abound that some items in her shop are subtly cursed or possess strange properties.

**Atmosphere:** Dimly lit, perpetually smelling of old wood, dust, and something faintly metallic or magical. Every surface is piled high with objects, creating narrow, winding paths for customers. Soft chimes often ring as customers accidentally bump into hanging trinkets.

## Proprietor

### Mirella Stonemark
**Role:** Owner and Head Antiquarian of Stonemark Antiquities
**Faction:** Independent (Primarily loyal to her own interests and the pursuit of rare items)

**Background:**
- A skilled identifier and appraiser of ancient artifacts.
- Has a vast network of contacts for acquiring unique items, some legitimate, some less so.
- Views Manny's quest for the Codex with a mix of academic interest and mercantile opportunity.
- Her shop is an alternative information source for Manny's Codex quest.

**Goals:**
- Short-term: Acquire the next truly extraordinary artifact to add to her collection.
- Long-term: Uncover the secrets of a particular ancient civilization or magical tradition.

**Personality:**
- Shrewd, observant, and possessing a dry, sarcastic wit.
- Appears aloof and distracted, but misses nothing happening in her shop.
- Has a deep respect for knowledge and history, but also a keen business sense.
- Can be surprisingly generous to those who earn her respect or provide her with interesting items.

**Appearance:** Human female, late 40s, sharp features, often wears spectacles perched on her nose. Her clothes are practical but covered in dust and stray threads from handling various fabrics. Her fingers are long and nimble, often stained with faint residues from ancient materials.

**Interaction Hooks:**
- Would seek player help with: Retrieving a specific item from a dangerous location, investigating the provenance of a newly acquired artifact, dealing with a rival antiquarian, finding a rare component for a magical appraisal.
- Reluctance level: Moderate (prefers to work alone, but understands the need for assistance on dangerous tasks).
- Can offer players: Appraisal services, identification of magical items, obscure historical information, unique items for sale (some with minor quirks or curses), leads on hidden ruins or ancient sites.

## Day-to-Day Operations

**Hours:** Generally open from noon to sunset, but Mirella sometimes opens at odd hours if a particularly interesting item arrives or a secretive client calls.

**Typical Day:**
- Sifting through new acquisitions, appraising items, cleaning and cataloging.
- Researching the history and origins of her inventory.

**Regular Customers:**
- Members of the Grand Academy (for historical items or research materials).
- Independent mages seeking rare spell components.
- Adventurers looking for magical trinkets or information on ancient foes.
- Smugglers discreetly offloading newly "found" treasures.

## DM Notes

### Plot Hooks

**The Fragmented Map:**
- Mirella acquires a tattered map fragment that seems to depict a section of the Codex's journey or a hidden location it might be in.
- She needs the party to find the other fragments or verify its authenticity.
- Reward: Information about the Codex, a valuable item from her shop, or a significant sum of gold.

**A Rival's Scheme:**
- A competing antiquarian attempts to steal an item from Mirella's shop or disrupt her business.
- Mirella, too busy with an appraisal, hires the party to discreetly handle the problem.
- Reward: Mirella's favor, access to her network, or a unique, possibly magical, item.

**The Curious Client:**
- A mysterious, cloaked figure frequently visits Stonemark Antiquities, asking unusual questions about a specific type of artifact (perhaps related to the Codex).
- Mirella suspects something is amiss and asks the party to observe or investigate the client.
- Reward: Uncovering a secret society, a new quest lead, or preventing a dangerous plot.

### Personality Quirks (Mirella)

- Always seems to be cleaning or polishing an item, even while speaking to customers.
- Has an unnerving ability to know what you're thinking before you say it.
- Her prices are always firm, but she can be convinced to trade for truly rare or unique items.

### Secret Information

**The True Value of an Item:**
- Mirella often knows the true magical or historical significance of an item far beyond its apparent worth.
- She sometimes "buries" powerful artifacts in plain sight, waiting for the right person or moment.

**Manny's Family Connection:**
- Mirella knows Manny's family has a long history of interest in certain ancient texts, possibly including the Codex.
- She has subtly guided him, believing he might be the one to truly understand its purpose.

**A Hidden Compartment:**
- There's a hidden compartment beneath her counter containing a small, personal collection of items too dangerous or precious to sell.
- One of these items might be a key to understanding the Codex or an artifact that directly interacts with it.
