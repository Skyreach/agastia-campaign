# Blades of Glory

## Overview

**Location:** Research Quarter (Tier 2-3), elevated terrace overlooking the city, near Augury Spire

**Clientele:** Elite warriors, Council champions, high-level adventurers, noble house guards, heroes of renown

**Reputation:** "Where legends arm themselves." The finest magical weaponsmith in Agastia, perhaps the entire region. Every piece a masterwork combining enchantment theory with battlefield-tested practicality.

## DM Notes

### Plot Hooks

**The Shapeshifting Project:**
- Kaelith's current obsession: perfecting adaptive weapon enchantment
- Needs rare materials: essence from shapeshifter (werewolf, doppelganger, etc.)
- Also needs field data: How do warriors adjust tactics when weapon form changes mid-combat?
- Reward for assistance: Prototype Blade of Glory (enhanced version, unique properties)
- Difficulty: Moderate-High (acquiring materials dangerous, testing requires real combat)

**The Rival Enchanter:**
- New shop in Noble Quarter producing "equivalent quality" at half price
- Kaelith skeptical - either using inferior methods or dangerous shortcuts
- Rumors suggest items contain hidden flaws/curses discovered after purchase
- Needs investigation: Are they frauds, using forbidden techniques, or legitimately innovative?
- Reward: 20% discount on future purchases, introduction to Council's security officials
- Difficulty: Moderate (investigation, possible confrontation with rival's backers)

**The Stolen Prototype:**
- Experimental weapon disappeared from forge
- Either industrial espionage or worse - design could be weaponized if replicated
- Kaelith concerned it's incomplete, might malfunction catastrophically
- Tracking magical signature difficult - thieves knew how to shield it
- Reward: Favor from Kaelith (redeemable for major service), potential keep recovered prototype
- Difficulty: High (thieves skilled, likely chaos cult or rival nation agents)

**The Legendary Commission:**
- Wealthy patron (or Council itself) commissions ultimate weapon
- Requires materials from multiple extremely dangerous locations
- Timeline compresses if party can recover materials quickly
- Kaelith offers party first pick of one custom enchantment (within reason) if they help
- Reward: Custom enchanted item, significant payment, prestige
- Difficulty: Very High (materials from high-level threats)

### Personality Quirks

- Refers to weapons as "she/her" or "he/him" based on personality perceived during crafting
- Can't resist explaining enchantment theory even when customer just wants to buy
- Taste-tests metals (claims can assess purity by flavor)
- Maintains personal combat practice despite scholarly focus (surprises challengers)
- Keeps journal of every weapon created, tracks their fates obsessively
- Becomes melancholy when legendary weapons are lost or destroyed
- Refuses to create weapons for causes she considers unjust

### Secret Information

**The Anti-Chaos Arsenal:**
- Hidden forge section developing weapons specifically harmful to chaos-touched
- Council-funded black project, highly classified
- Enchantments incorporate principles opposite to chaos magic
- Some designs dangerously unstable - fighting fire with fire creates risks
- Party discovering this reveals Kaelith's deeper involvement in anti-chaos operations

**The First Blade:**
- Kaelith's original masterwork, never sold
- Sentient weapon with whom she maintains relationship
- Serves as advisor and quality control ("Would you trust your life to this?")
- Extremely powerful, only drawn in true emergencies
- Knows secrets about Kaelith's past she doesn't discuss

**The Price of Perfection:**
- Kaelith's obsession occasionally drives her to dangerous extremes
- Has experimented with chaos magic theory to understand its opposite
- This flirtation with forbidden knowledge worries colleagues
- She believes understanding chaos necessary to defeat it (dangerous reasoning)
- Walking edge where brilliance borders on obsession

**Noble Connections:**
- Several Noble Quarter families commission exclusively from Kaelith
- These relationships create political obligations she'd prefer to avoid
- Sometimes pressured to prioritize influential clients over worthy heroes
- Struggles balancing commercial success with personal principles

### Integration with Campaign

**Immediate Access:**
- Party likely not qualified for entry initially
- Quest completion or recommendation needed
- This creates aspiration - shop to access after proving themselves

**Progressive Relationship:**
- First visit: Awed by inventory, priced out of most items
- Early access: Minor commission or identification service
- Building trust: Offered field-testing opportunity
- Established: Guild membership consideration, custom commissions
- Deep connection: Trusted with secret projects, anti-chaos research

**Chaos Cult Connection:**
- Cult wants Kaelith's anti-chaos research (to counter or corrupt it)
- Her weapons specifically threaten their operations
- Potential assassination/kidnapping target
- Party might need to protect her
- Or investigate when cult infiltrates her supply chain

**Mechanical Progression:**
- Shop provides tier-appropriate magic item access
- Custom commissions scale with party level
- Material gathering creates adventure opportunities
- Relationships unlock better services/prices
- Represents aspiration: "When we're high enough level to shop here regularly..."
