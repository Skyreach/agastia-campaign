# Inkwell & Quill

## Overview

**Type & Specialty:** Scribe shop and research services - copying documents, translation, calligraphy, rare ink formulations

**Location:** Scholar Quarter (Tier 3), near the Archive of Lost Histories

**Clientele:** Scholars, students, wealthy merchants needing official documents, wizards seeking spell scrolls

**Reputation:** Known for meticulous accuracy and discretion. "If Aldwin copied it, you can trust it's exact."

**Atmosphere:** Quiet shop smelling of ink and parchment. Rows of completed commissions hang drying on racks. Soft scratch of quills on paper. Sunlight filtered through tall windows illuminates dust motes. Clean, organized, professional.

## Proprietor

**Aldwin Quill** - Human male, mid-40s, Expert (Scribe)

**Personality:**
- Meticulous perfectionist - checks his work three times
- Soft-spoken but firm on deadlines and quality
- Passionate about preserving knowledge accurately

**Appearance:** Ink-stained fingers, wire-rimmed spectacles, neat beard going gray, well-worn but clean robes. Always has a quill tucked behind his ear.

**Motivation:** Believes accurate record-keeping prevents history from being lost or rewritten. Takes professional pride in every commission.

**Quest Hook - The Disputed Contract:**
- **Need:** Two merchants are in legal dispute over contract terms. Aldwin copied the original but now both claim he made errors favoring the other party. His reputation is at stake.
- **Problem:** Original contract was stolen from Merit Council archives. Aldwin needs someone to recover it to prove his copy is accurate.
- **Reward:** In exchange for recovering the original and clearing his name, Aldwin will provide:
  - Free copying services (1 scroll/document per month for 6 months)
  - Translation services (any language he knows)
  - Introduction to Archive of Lost Histories staff (DC reduction for research checks)
- **Difficulty:** Moderate - requires investigation and possibly stealth/social skills. No combat expected unless thieves are encountered.
