# The Hidden Door

## Overview

**Type & Specialty:** Underground inn and unofficial safe house - lodging for those who can't (or won't) stay in upper tiers, no questions asked

**Location:** [[The Depths]] (Tier 7), accessed through unmarked door in abandoned warehouse basement, known only to locals

**Clientele:** [[Dispossessed]], fugitives (not all guilty), people hiding from someone, underground network members, anyone needing to disappear for a while

**Reputation:** "If you need to not be found, go see Senna." Absolute discretion. No one talks about who stays at The Hidden Door. Ever.

**Atmosphere:** Dim oil lamps, stone walls, low ceilings. Smells of mushroom stew, damp stone, and lamp oil. Quiet - people here don't want to draw attention. Surprisingly clean despite location. Feels like a cave made comfortable. Safe, secret, hidden from the world above.

## Proprietor

**Senna Darkwell** - Human female, age unclear (40s-50s?), former [[Dispossessed]] leader (current status: complicated)

**Personality:**
- Fiercely protective of guests - their secrets die with her
- Shrewd judge of character - knows when someone's truly in need vs. truly dangerous
- Warm to those she trusts, ice-cold to threats

**Appearance:** Dark skin, graying black hair in tight braids, one clouded eye (old injury), strong build. Dresses in dark practical clothing. Moves silently despite size. Always has at least two knives visible (more hidden).

**Motivation:** [[The Depths]] saved her life when she had nothing. Now she provides the same sanctuary for others. Believes everyone deserves a place to sleep safely, no matter what brought them there.

**Quest Hook - The Fugitive's Dilemma:**
- **Need:** A guest named Darin is hiding at The Hidden Door - he's accused of theft from a [[Merit Council]] official. Claims he's innocent, was framed. Senna believes him, but [[Merit Council]] guards are asking questions in [[The Depths]].
- **Problem:** Senna can't keep Darin hidden forever. She needs someone to investigate what really happened and clear his name (or at minimum, get evidence he was framed so [[Merit Council]] backs off).
- **Reward:** In exchange for clearing Darin's name or proving the frameup:
  - Free lodging at The Hidden Door whenever needed (private, secure, off the grid)
  - Access to [[Dispossessed]] information network (what happens in [[The Depths]], who's hiding, who's looking)
  - Senna's personal protection (she has connections and isn't afraid to use them)
  - Safe house services (hide someone, store contraband, no questions)
  - Introduction to [[Dispossessed]] faction leaders (potential allies against Merit Council)
- **Difficulty:** Moderate - Requires investigation, possibly confronting [[Merit Council]] official, gathering evidence. If official is corrupt, could be dangerous. Likely connects to broader corruption (possibly Kaelborn/Geist related).

## Day-to-Day Operations

**Hours:**
- Always open - Senna or her assistant is always present
- Quietest: Midday (most guests sleep then or are out working)
- Busiest: Evening/night (people coming to hide, to rest, to meet)

**Typical Day:**
- Morning: Senna prepares communal breakfast, checks on long-term guests
- Midday: Cleaning, food prep, quiet hours
- Afternoon: Interviews potential new guests (careful screening)
- Evening: Busiest time, new arrivals, meals served, information exchanged
- Night: Senna stays up, guards the door, ensures everyone's safe

**Regular Customers:**
- **[[Dispossessed]]:** Those fallen to lowest tier, nowhere else to go
- **Fugitives:** Accused (justly or not), hiding from law/enemies
- **Underground network:** Information brokers, resistance members, those opposing [[Merit Council]]
- **Desperate travelers:** Can't afford upper-tier inns, need cheap safe space
- **Political refugees:** Those on wrong side of [[Merit Council]] politics

**Real Uses:**
- **Off-the-grid lodging:** No names recorded, no questions asked, completely discreet
- **Safe house:** Hide from pursuers, store contraband, meet in secret
- **Information network:** [[Dispossessed]] know everything happening in lower [[Agastia]]
- **Political refuge:** Safe from [[Merit Council]] harassment (they don't come to [[The Depths]] easily)
- **Community support:** Senna feeds those who can't pay, provides basic medical care
- **Underground contacts:** Meet [[Dispossessed]] leaders, resistance members, information brokers

## DM Notes

**Plot Hooks:**
- **Safe base in [[The Depths]]:** Party needs place to stay off-grid, plan in secret, hide from pursuers
- **Fugitive quest:** Investigating Darin's frameup likely connects to corrupt [[Merit Council]] official (possibly Kaelborn network)
- **[[Dispossessed]] information:** Senna's network knows everything happening in lower [[Agastia]]
- **Political sanctuary:** Party members targeted by [[Merit Council]] can hide here
- **Underground contacts:** Meet [[Dispossessed]] leaders, resistance members, learn about inequality in [[Agastia]]
- **Moral complexity:** Not everyone here is innocent, but all deserve safety - party must judge each case

**Personality Quirks:**
- Never forgets a face or a kindness
- Speaks softly but commands immediate respect
- Tests newcomers subtly before deciding if she trusts them
- Has code phrases guests use to identify each other ("looking for a hidden door" = seeking sanctuary)
- Keeps tally of debts owed and paid (never mentions it, but remembers)

**Connection to Campaign:**
- **[[Dispossessed]] faction:** Direct access to faction leaders and perspective
- **[[Merit Council]] corruption:** Many here are victims of Kaelborn/Geist operations
- **Information network:** Knows what's really happening in [[Agastia]]'s underbelly
- **Thematic relevance:** Inequality, justice, who gets protection and who doesn't
- **Safe planning space:** Party can operate outside [[Merit Council]] surveillance

**Atmosphere Notes:**
- Underground feel - stone, shadows, lamp oil, quiet
- Sense of community despite desperation - people here help each other
- Wariness - guests don't make eye contact, don't ask questions
- Safety despite danger - this place is protected by absolute discretion
- Senna's presence is reassuring, dangerous, protective all at once

**Rules Enforcement:**
- Violence inside = immediate expulsion + word spreads (never safe in [[The Depths]] again)
- Betraying other guests = worse than expulsion (underground justice is harsh)
- Breaking Senna's trust = permanent consequences (she has long memory and longer reach)

**Darin's Frameup (Quest Details):**
- Accused of stealing from [[Merit Council]] official's office
- Actually discovered evidence of corruption, official framed him to discredit
- Evidence still exists if party can find it
- Official is mid-level (not Kaelborn, but connected to same network)
- Clearing Darin exposes corruption, makes [[Merit Council]] enemies, gains [[Dispossessed]] allies
