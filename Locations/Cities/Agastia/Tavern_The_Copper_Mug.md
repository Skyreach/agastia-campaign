# The Copper Mug

## Overview

**Type & Specialty:** Working-class tavern serving affordable food, cheap ale, and serving as community gathering place for lower district residents

**Location:** Lower Residential District (Tier 5), corner of Artisan Row and Cooper Street

**Clientele:** Dockworkers, artisans, laborers, off-duty city guard, struggling merchants, anyone who can't afford upper-tier prices

**Reputation:** "Honest food, honest prices, honest folk." Not fancy, but reliable. Safe place for working people to unwind without pretension.

**Atmosphere:** Worn but clean. Long wooden tables scarred by years of use. Smell of stew always simmering, cheap ale, sawdust on floors. Loud conversations, laughter, occasional singing. Copper mugs hang from ceiling (tradition - buy one, your name etched on it, drink free on your nameday). Warm, welcoming, lived-in.

## Proprietor

**Marta Brennan** - Human female, late 30s, former cook for merchant caravan

**Personality:**
- Motherly but fierce - protects her regulars like family
- Sharp ear for gossip, good memory for faces and stories
- No tolerance for troublemakers but welcomes everyone else

**Appearance:** Round-faced, strong arms from years of cooking, graying brown hair in practical bun, perpetually dusted with flour. Warm smile, laugh lines around eyes. Always wearing stained apron.

**Motivation:** Wants to provide a safe, affordable place for working folk. Remembers what it's like to work all day and need a hot meal you can afford. Takes pride in serving honest food to honest people.

**Quest Hook - The Protection Racket:**
- **Need:** Thugs claiming to work for "Warehouse District interests" are demanding protection money from businesses in Tier 5. Marta refuses to pay - she barely makes ends meet as is.
- **Problem:** The thugs are escalating. They've threatened to "accidentally" start a fire or poison her food supplies. Marta needs help dealing with them without involving Merit Council (who she doesn't trust to help poor folk).
- **Reward:** In exchange for stopping the protection racket:
  - Free meals and lodging whenever party is in Agastia (simple but filling)
  - Marta's regulars will share information freely (dock gossip, artisan rumors, lower district happenings)
  - Safe meeting place - Marta will provide private back room for planning
  - Introduction to honest working folk network (hirelings, laborers who'll help party)
- **Difficulty:** Moderate - Thugs are dangerous but not highly skilled. Real challenge is finding out who's backing them and whether it connects to bigger criminal network (possibly Geist's operation).

## DM Notes

**Plot Hooks:**
- Perfect base of operations for party in Agastia (affordable, welcoming, central to lower districts)
- Protection racket quest connects to Geist investigation (if party helps Marta, they learn about wider criminal network)
- Information hub - regulars know everything happening in Tiers 5-7
- Warm roleplaying location - NPCs with personality, community feel
- Marta can provide contacts for honest labor, services, hirelings

**Personality Quirks:**
- Knows everyone's drink order and life story
- Calls regulars "sweetie" or "dear" but uses full names for strangers
- Keeps running tab for regulars who fall on hard times (never mentions it)
- Throws out troublemakers personally (stronger than she looks)
- Hums while cooking, whole tavern knows the tunes

**Connection to Campaign:**
- Protection racket likely connects to Geist's operation (Tier 6 thugs expanding to Tier 5)
- Dockworkers here have information about warehouse district activities
- Regulars can provide perspective on Merit Council's treatment of lower districts (theme: inequality)
- Safe place for party to rest, plan, gather information without upper-tier scrutiny

**Atmosphere Notes:**
- Encourage players to roleplay interactions with regulars
- Marta remembers party members, asks about their adventures
- Other customers react to party's reputation (if they help Marta, they become local heroes)
- Create sense of community - this isn't just a tavern, it's home for these people
