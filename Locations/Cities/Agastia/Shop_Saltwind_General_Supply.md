# [[Saltwind General Supply]]

## Overview

**Type & Specialty:** Sailor provisions and ship supplies - rope, canvas, tools, preserved food, navigation equipment, and everything needed for maritime work

**Location:** [[Dock District]] (Tier 6), Pier Row, three buildings down from Warehouse 7

**Clientele:** Sailors, dockworkers, fishermen, ship captains, caravan guards (rope and canvas), anyone needing maritime supplies

**Reputation:** "Olric's prices are fair and his rope don't break." Reliable quality for working sailors. Not fancy, but honest goods that last.

**Atmosphere:** Smells of tar, salt, and canvas. Coils of rope everywhere. Sails and tarps hang from rafters. Sound of dock work filters in - creaking ships, shouting workers, seabirds. Practical, no-frills, organized chaos.

## Proprietor

**Olric Saltwind** - Half-elf male, early 60s, former ship's quartermaster (retired)

**Personality:**
- Straight-talking pragmatist - no patience for haggling or nonsense
- Generous to those in genuine need, stubborn against cheats
- Deeply worried about dock district corruption but feels powerless

**Appearance:** Weather-beaten face, salt-and-pepper hair in sailor's queue, muscular build going soft with age. Always wears faded blue coat (old ship uniform). Walks with slight limp (old injury).

**Motivation:** Retired from sea after leg injury. Opened shop to serve honest sailors - the people he worked with for 40 years. Wants to protect his community from corruption creeping into the docks.

**Quest Hook - The Inspection Harassment:**
- **Need:** "Inspector [[Geist (Bandit Lieutenant)]]" has been targeting Olric's shop for repeated "inspections." Every time, [[Geist (Bandit Lieutenant)]] finds minor violations (real or fabricated) and demands "fines" - really bribes. Olric can't afford this much longer.
- **Problem:** [[Geist (Bandit Lieutenant)]] has threatened to confiscate Olric's entire inventory for "safety violations" if he doesn't pay 50 gp immediately. Olric knows it's extortion but can't prove it. He needs evidence of [[Geist (Bandit Lieutenant)]]'s corruption or a way to stop the harassment.
- **Reward:** In exchange for stopping [[Geist (Bandit Lieutenant)]]'s harassment (with proof or permanent solution):
  - 15% permanent discount on all maritime supplies
  - Access to "sailor's network" information (what ships have seen, where they've been, rumors from other ports)
  - Quality rope and canvas guaranteed - Olric personally tests every coil
  - Introduction to honest dock captains (potential ship passage, information, allies)
  - Hidden storage space in shop for party's gear (secure, no questions asked)
- **Difficulty:** Moderate to High - Directly connected to [[Kyle/Nameless]]'s [[Geist (Bandit Lieutenant)]] investigation. Gathering evidence on [[Geist (Bandit Lieutenant)]] is challenging and potentially dangerous.

## Day-to-Day Operations

**Hours:**
- Dawn to dusk (5am-7pm): Sailors work early, Olric opens early
