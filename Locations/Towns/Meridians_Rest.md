# [[Meridian's Rest]]

## Player Summary

[[Meridian's Rest]] is a small waystation settlement positioned at a strategic crossroads between [[Agastia]] City and the dangerous northern territories near the [[Infinite Forest]]. The town serves travelers, merchants, and those brave or desperate enough to venture toward the wilderness. Its most distinctive feature is an ancient sundial monument in the town square that seems to function strangely - casting shadows that don't quite match the sun's position.

### The Settlement

**Size & Population**
A modest town of a few hundred permanent residents, swelling with transient travelers during peak seasons. The population is pragmatic and hardy - those who live here have made peace with danger and uncertainty.

**Primary Function**
[[Meridian's Rest]] exists to serve travelers:
- Inn and taverns for overnight accommodation
- Stables and wagon repair services
- Provisions and emergency supplies
- Guide services for forest travel
- Last chance for preparation before dangerous areas

**The Temporal Sundial**
The town square features an elaborate ancient sundial, far more sophisticated than the settlement around it. The sundial's shadow often points to the "wrong" time, sometimes running ahead or behind actual time. Locals claim it "keeps true time" even when clocks disagree, though what "true time" means varies depending on who you ask.

### Atmosphere

The settlement has a frontier quality - practical, somewhat rough, but with surprising pockets of comfort. Permanent residents view transients with cautious friendliness; they'll help but expect payment. There's a sense that everyone here is either running toward something or away from something.

Evenings bring a community atmosphere as travelers share tales and warnings about routes ahead. The inn's common room serves as informal information exchange and social center.

### Services Available

**The Traveler's Rest Inn**
Main accommodation, run by a practical woman named Sergeant Kess (former [[Merit Council]] soldier). Clean beds, decent food, and no tolerance for troublemakers.

**Brighthorn Stables**
Horse and wagon care, run by the Brighthorn family. They also breed horses adapted to handle the strange phenomena near the [[Infinite Forest]].

**Meridian Supplies**
General store stocking travel necessities. Prices slightly inflated but stock is reliable. Owner, Tam Quickcount, knows everything about who's passing through and where they're going.

**Guide's Guild Hall**
Small office where licensed guides offer services for forest travel. Guides are expensive but worth it. Unlicensed guides are cheaper and often dead.

## DM Notes

### The Town's Secret

**Temporal Anomaly Zone**
[[Meridian's Rest]] sits on a subtle temporal distortion. Time flows slightly differently here than surrounding areas, making it a natural "rest point" where travelers recover more quickly and certain magical effects behave strangely.

The sundial doesn't malfunction - it actually displays correct time, while normal clocks in the area run inconsistently. Locals have adapted to this without fully understanding it.

**Ancient Purpose**
The sundial (and the settlement site) predate modern civilization by centuries. It was originally a boundary marker or perhaps a control point for a larger temporal management system. The same symbols found throughout the campaign appear on the sundial's base, though weathered and partially obscured.

**The Name's Meaning**
"Meridian" refers to both geographic meridians (lines of longitude) and moments of peak or culmination. The town sits at a temporal meridian - a point where past, present, and possible futures align more closely than normal. Those sensitive to such things report prophetic dreams or moments of uncanny insight while staying here.

### Key NPCs

**Sergeant Kess - Innkeeper**
Former [[Merit Council]] soldier who left service after "seeing things in the forest that command wouldn't believe." Runs the inn with military efficiency. Has extensive knowledge of forest dangers and good judgment about people. Quietly assists those fleeing [[Merit Council]] persecution while maintaining official neutrality.

**Tam Quickcount - Merchant**
Halfling merchant who knows everyone's business and uses information as currency. Friendly and helpful if he likes you, obstructionist if he doesn't. Has connections to multiple factions and sells intelligence along with supplies.

**Mother Brighthorn - Stable Keeper**
Matriarch of the Brighthorn family, elderly human with uncanny rapport with animals. Her horses handle forest phenomena better than normal stock (she selectively breeds for temporal resistance without understanding the mechanism). Suspicious of outsiders but fiercely loyal to those who earn trust.

**Moss (sometimes)**
The forest guide Moss uses [[Meridian's Rest]] as a base between expeditions. Taciturn and professional, but will share basic survival information over drinks. Knows more about forest secrets than anyone admits.

**Scholar Terin**
A young academic who came to study the sundial and ended up staying. Fascinated by the temporal phenomena but struggles to get official support for research. Has developed theories connecting the sundial to the broader boundary stone network, though he doesn't realize how close to truth he's gotten.

### Faction Presence

**[[Merit Council]]**
Light presence - occasional patrols and a small guard post. They mostly let the town self-govern as long as taxes are paid and no overt rebellion occurs.

**[[Chaos Cult]]**
Several cult sympathizers among the population, drawn by the temporal anomalies they see as proof of reality's fragility. No organized cell but individual members passing through or observing.

**The [[Dispossessed]]**
Some residents are refugees from the merit system. The town offers relative freedom from merit ranking pressure, attracting those who couldn't or wouldn't compete.

**Neutral Ground**
Like the Biago family restaurant in [[Agastia]], [[Meridian's Rest]] maintains informal neutrality. Factions don't attack each other here because everyone needs the services. Sergeant Kess enforces this with surprising effectiveness.

### Adventure Hooks

**Temporal Mysteries**
- Investigating the sundial's true nature
- Strange phenomena during specific times of day/year
- Prophetic dreams providing adventure leads
- Temporal distortions growing stronger or more dangerous
- Connection to larger boundary stone network

**Frontier Problems**
- Monsters from the forest threatening trade routes
- Disputes between guides and clients
- Refugees fleeing destroyed settlements
- Merchant caravans going missing
- Bandits exploiting remote location

**Factional Tensions**
- Cult activity around temporal anomalies
- [[Merit Council]] increasing control
- [[Dispossessed]] organizing resistance
- Information brokering between factions
- Neutral ground status threatened

**Personal Stories**
- NPCs with secrets or needs requiring help
- Travelers with unusual cargo or missions
- Guide expeditions needing additional members
- Town defense when threats emerge
- Mysterious strangers with warnings or offers

### Secret Locations

**The Sundial's Chamber**
Beneath the sundial lies a sealed chamber containing temporal manipulation mechanisms from the ancient civilization. Access requires specific knowledge of the symbols and temporal conditions. The chamber connects to other sites in the boundary network.

**The Old Road**
A forgotten path behind the town leads to pre-Council ruins that locals avoid. The path experiences severe temporal distortion - travelers might emerge hours, days, or even years displaced from when they entered.

**Kess's Armory**
The inn's cellar contains Sergeant Kess's hidden weapons cache from her military days, plus equipment confiscated from troublemakers. Also houses a small shrine to those lost to the forest, where Kess keeps notes on disappearances and strange phenomena.

**The Overnight Stable**
One stable building at the edge of the Brighthorn property experiences temporal loops. Animals sometimes refuse to enter. Mother Brighthorn uses it for storing equipment rather than housing horses, knowing something's wrong but not what.

### Campaign Integration

**Caravan Route**
For Session 1, [[Meridian's Rest]] could serve as:
- **Starting Point:** Where the patron hires the party
- **Waystation:** Stop along the route to Ratterdan
- **Destination:** Alternative endpoint if Ratterdan seems too dangerous for level 1

**Recurring Location**
The town's position and services make it a natural base for:
- Northern expeditions and forest exploration
- Information gathering and factional interactions
- Recovering between dangerous missions
- Long-term campaign anchor point
- Access to guides and specialized equipment

**Temporal Plot Thread**
The sundial connects to larger mysteries about:
- Ancient civilization that created the boundary network
- Symbols matching [[Josh]]'s markings
- Reality manipulation and temporal magic
- [[The Codex]]'s true nature
- Ways to control or stabilize the [[Infinite Forest]] expansion

### Dangers

**Social:** Frontier justice can be harsh, and the wrong enemies end careers or lives

**Environmental:** Proximity to forest means occasional monster incursions

**Temporal:** Time distortions can trap, age, or displace the unwary

**Factional:** Neutral ground status is respected but not absolute

**Economic:** Remote location means limited options when things go wrong

### Resources

[[Meridian's Rest]] offers practical frontier resources rather than urban sophistication. Access to guides, information about northern territories, temporal anomaly insights, and a relatively safe base for dangerous work. The town's greatest resource is its people - survivors who know how to operate on civilization's edge.
