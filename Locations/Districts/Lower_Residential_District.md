# [[Lower Residential District]]

## Player Summary

The [[Lower Residential District]] houses [[Agastia]]'s working class - those who've earned sufficient merit to maintain residency but occupy the city's economic foundation rather than its heights. Unlike the desperation of lower tiers, residents here maintain honest employment and modest but stable lives.

The district feels lived-in and genuine. Buildings show wear but receive regular maintenance. Streets remain clean through community effort rather than magical convenience. People know their neighbors, help each other during difficulties, and take pride in their contributions to [[Agastia]]'s functioning.

### Atmosphere

The sounds of daily life fill the streets - children playing, neighbors conversing, craftspeople working, merchants calling their wares. Smells of cooking food mix with wood smoke and honest labor. Everything feels more human-scaled compared to upper tiers' grandeur.

Buildings stand close together, creating intimate neighborhoods where everyone knows each other's business. This proximity creates both community support and lack of privacy. Gossip spreads quickly but so does help when someone faces trouble.

Unlike higher tiers' competitive striving or lower tiers' desperation, the [[Lower Residential District]] maintains steady rhythm of work, rest, and community. Most residents aren't trying to climb higher - they've found sustainable lives and focus on maintaining what they've achieved.

### Notable Establishments

**[[The Copper Mug (Tavern)]]**
Working-class tavern serving simple meals and cheap ale. Run by Marta Brennan, the tavern functions as community gathering place where residents share news, offer mutual support, and occasionally organize collective action. Basic lodging available (3cp/meal, 1sp/night shared room). The Mug represents the district's heart - unpretentious, welcoming, and fundamentally decent.

**Ironhand Repairs**
General repair shop handling everything from furniture to tools to basic armor. Proprietor Garrett Ironhand (human craftsman) offers emergency loans to regular customers facing hard times. Prices fair, work honest, quality "good enough." The shop embodies district values - practical solutions, fair dealing, and community support over profit maximization.

**[[Stonewick Herbalist]]**
Small shop run by elderly herbalist Nessa Stonewick (halfling healer). Provides affordable healing alternatives for those who can't pay temple prices. Healing poultices (10gp, heals 1d4+1 HP over 1 hour), herbal disease remedies (25gp, Con save DC 12), and Potions of Healing (50gp). Nessa teaches Medicine skill during downtime (50gp for proficiency). Also serves as informal counselor and grandmother figure for the neighborhood.

**Threadbare Tailoring**
Affordable clothing repair and alteration. Can create simple new garments from purchased fabric. Owner Mira Threadbare (gnome seamstress) maintains impressive speed and quality despite low prices. Takes pride in keeping working families presentable without breaking their budgets.

**The Daily Board**
Community message center where residents post job opportunities, items for sale/trade, requests for help, and local news. Maintained by cooperative effort, the board demonstrates district's self-organization. Those seeking casual labor check here daily. Those needing specific help post requests. The board creates informal support network supplementing official institutions.

### Social Dynamics

Merit in Lower Residential comes from honest work, community contribution, and reliable character. A skilled carpenter who helps neighbors receives more respect than someone earning slightly more who keeps to themselves. Reputation matters enormously in close-knit communities.

Residents support each other through informal networks. When someone loses work, neighbors contribute food and help find new employment. When illness strikes, community organizes care. When celebration happens, everyone shares joy. This mutual support provides safety net official institutions don't offer.

However, this closeness creates pressure to conform. Those who act superior face social exclusion. Those who fail to contribute their share get reminded of community expectations. Gossip serves as social enforcement mechanism - maintaining good reputation requires genuine community participation.

Most residents accept their tier status philosophically. They've achieved stable lives through merit system and maintain that status through continued work. Dreams of climbing higher exist but don't dominate daily concerns like in Tier 4's aspirational culture.

### Daily Rhythms

Morning: Early risers heading to work. Parents preparing children for day. Small shops opening for business. Community wells and fountains busy as households collect water.

Midday: Streets quieter as most work elsewhere. Elderly residents, parents with young children, and those working night shifts visible. Small lunch vendors serve those who work nearby.

Afternoon: Children return from schools or apprenticeships. Shops serving local needs see peak traffic. Neighbors chat while running errands. Community starts transitioning from work to home life.

Evening: Workers return home tired but satisfied. Families share meals. [[The Copper Mug (Tavern)]] fills with those seeking company and relaxation. Streets alive with conversation and laughter. Community bonds strengthen through casual socializing.

Night: District quiets as residents rest for next day's work. Neighborhood watch volunteers patrol informally. Those working night shifts depart for employment elsewhere. Sense of security from knowing neighbors watch out for each other.

## DM Notes

### Hidden Operations

**Underground Labor Organization**
Informal workers' collective coordinates response to unfair treatment by employers, organizes mutual aid during hard times, and occasionally engages in work stoppages when conditions become intolerable. Not officially recognized union - operating in gray area of legality. Leadership rotates to avoid targeting by authorities. Council tolerates them provided they don't disrupt city functions, but would move against any actual rebellion.

**[[Chaos Cult]] Recruitment Grounds**
The district's economic precarity makes residents vulnerable to chaos cult recruitment. Promises of power and revenge against those above appeal to those feeling merit system failed them. Most residents resist, but some - especially those who've suffered setbacks - prove susceptible. Cells operate carefully, knowing community cohesion creates natural resistance to chaos's divisiveness.

**[[Merit Council]] Intelligence**
Council maintains surveillance on Lower Residential watching for organized resistance or chaos cult activity. Some residents unknowingly report to Council handlers, believing they're helping maintain order. This creates paranoia among those organizing legitimate collective action - never certain who might inform on them.

**The Helping Hand**
Secret network of residents with higher-tier connections who assist community members facing bureaucratic obstacles, merit status disputes, or other official problems. Operates through carefully maintained anonymity to avoid accusations of circumventing proper channels. Those helped often never know who aided them, creating culture of "paying it forward" through helping others.

### Key NPCs

**Marta Brennan**
Proprietor of [[The Copper Mug (Tavern)]] and unofficial community leader. Wise, compassionate, fiercely protective of neighborhood. Knows everyone's business but keeps confidences carefully. Recognizes signs of chaos cult recruitment and subtly intervenes. Has connections reaching surprisingly high through customers who've risen from working class roots. Offers party member [[Nikki]] motherly advice and practical support.

**Garrett Ironhand**
Repair shop owner and backbone of community's practical infrastructure. Skilled craftsman who could work in higher tiers but prefers living among "real people." Quietly wealthy from careful savings and wise investments, uses resources to help neighbors during crises. Secret funder of workers' collective. Knows which officials can be reasoned with and which require pressure.

**Nessa Stonewick**
Elderly halfling herbalist serving as district's healer and grandmother figure. Knows folk remedies passed down through generations. Surprisingly perceptive about people's true character - claims plants teach you to read deeper than surface. Aware of chaos cult's presence and actively works to strengthen community bonds as counter-measure. Has trained several students who've become healers elsewhere, maintaining network throughout [[Agastia]].

**Watch Captain Torren Blake**
Oversees official security in Lower Residential. Unlike many officials, genuinely cares about residents' wellbeing rather than just maintaining order. Struggles to balance official duties with community sympathy. Knows about workers' collective but chooses selective blindness as long as they stay non-violent. Trying to prevent chaos cult infiltration while respecting residents' privacy. Walking ethical tightrope between loyalty to Council and community.

### Secret Locations

**The Gathering Hall**
Hidden meeting space in building's basement where workers' collective gathers. Unmarked entrance, password-protected access, maintained collectively. Contains records of labor disputes, membership lists (carefully encoded), and plans for future organization. Discovery by authorities would result in arrests and dissolution.

**Nessa's Back Garden**
Behind herbalist shop lies remarkably large garden (magically expanded, though Nessa claims it's "just good planning"). Grows both medicinal herbs and plants useful for other purposes - some technically restricted by Council regulations. Secret section contains evidence of chaos magic corruption in local plants, which Nessa studies trying to develop natural counter-measures.

**The Community Cache**
Hidden food and supply storage maintained collectively for emergencies. When residents face crisis - fire, illness, job loss - cache provides immediate relief while community organizes longer-term support. Location known only to trusted community leaders who rotate responsibility. Existence demonstrates district's self-sufficiency and mutual support.

**Ironhand's Workshop**
Basement below repair shop contains Garrett's real work area - where he crafts items exceeding "good enough" quality, maintains weapons for neighborhood protection, and stores savings he uses for community support. Hidden compartment holds evidence of official corruption affecting workers that he's compiled over years. Insurance policy ensuring authorities think twice about targeting the district.

- **Political:** District's collective action might be labeled rebellion
- **Chaos:** Vulnerability to recruitment creates ongoing infiltration threat
- **Exploitation:** Those with power often view district as resource to extract from

### Resources

[[Lower Residential District]] offers resources often overlooked by those focused on wealth and power:
- Community support and mutual aid networks
- Practical skills and honest labor
- Affordable services for basic needs
- Local knowledge and neighborhood intelligence
- Authentic relationships based on character rather than status
- Perspective on how [[Agastia]]'s policies affect ordinary people

The district represents [[Agastia]]'s working heart - people who make the city function through daily labor while receiving little recognition. Understanding their struggles, strengths, and community bonds reveals how merit system works for those neither at the top nor the bottom. These are the people most worth protecting when crisis comes, and the ones most dangerous to overlook.
