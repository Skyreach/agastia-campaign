# Dock District

## Player Summary

The Dock District sits at [[Agastia]]'s edge where city meets water, housing those who've lost merit status but continue working to regain it. Maritime workers, cargo handlers, ship crews, and those fallen from higher positions struggle here to prove they deserve another chance.

The district feels rougher than Lower Residential - more transient, more desperate, more willing to bend rules for survival. Salt air mixes with sweat and fish. Buildings show neglect. Streets go uncleaned. But amid the hardship lives stubborn determination. These people haven't given up, even if the city has partially given up on them.

### Atmosphere

Constant activity surrounds the docks - ships loading and unloading, cranes swinging cargo, workers shouting coordinates, merchants inspecting goods. The smell of salt water, fish, tar, and unwashed bodies permeates everything. Seabirds cry overhead, sometimes diving for scraps.

Buildings lean slightly, worn by weather and time. Repairs happen when absolutely necessary rather than preventatively. Streets muddy from sea spray and rain. Everything feels temporary, provisional - matching residents' uncertain status.

Unlike Lower Residential's community cohesion, Dock District remains more fragmented. People come and go with the tides. Trust develops slowly. Many keep to themselves, nursing private shame about their fall from status. Others blame the system and nurse resentment. Some find camaraderie in shared struggle.

### Notable Establishments

**The Rusty Anchor Tavern**
Working dock tavern serving watered-down ale (1cp) and questionable stew (2cp, Con save DC 10 or sickened). Floor space for sleeping (1cp/night). Despite rough conditions, the Anchor provides community space for dock workers to share information, commiserate, and occasionally organize collective action. Run by grizzled ex-sailor known only as "Captain" who asks no questions and tolerates no violence against patrons.

**[[Saltwind General Supply]]**
Maritime supply shop run by Olric Saltwind (see establishment file). Offers equipment for sailing, fishing, and dock work. Harpoons (5gp), boarding axes (10gp), nets, ropes, waterproofing services (10gp). Also fences items "no questions asked" and maintains connections to smuggling operations. Olric treats everyone fairly regardless of their fall from status, earning fierce loyalty.

**[[Tidecaller Armory]]**
Dock district's weapons shop specializing in maritime combat gear and salvaged equipment. Proprietor "Iron Tooth" Margret (half-orc veteran) sells waterproofed weapons, salvaged armor (half price but cosmetically damaged), and maritime-specific items. Repairs using salvaged parts (1/3 cost, takes 1d4 days). Connects those seeking work as ship guards or bounty hunters with opportunities.

**[[Sawbones Surgery]]**
Barber-surgeon operated by Doc Harrow (human surgeon of questionable credentials). Performs surgeries, sets bones, extracts teeth. Risky services (Con saves required, potential damage) but cheaper than alternatives. Surgery to remove foreign objects (25gp, DC 12 Con save or 2d6 damage), set broken bones (10gp, heals in half time), stitches (5gp, stabilize dying). 25% chance of infection after treatment. Doc drinks but claims steady hands regardless.

**The Manifest Office**
Official government outpost tracking cargo, collecting tariffs, and monitoring who enters/leaves by sea. Understaffed and often corrupt. Officers supplement income by accepting bribes to overlook irregularities. Those knowing whom to pay can move goods without excessive scrutiny. Those without connections face arbitrary enforcement.

### Social Dynamics

The Dock District's population divides roughly into three groups: maritime workers who've always lived here, those fallen from higher status trying to recover, and criminals using the chaos for cover.

**Maritime Workers:** Proud of their profession despite low status. Skilled, hardworking, resentful of being looked down upon. They know [[Agastia]] depends on their labor even while treating them as lower tier. Tight bonds among those sharing dangerous work at sea.

**The Fallen:** Former Tier 4-5 residents who lost merit status through various failures. Some work diligently to regain lost ground. Others spiral into despair or resentment. Their presence creates tension - maritime workers resent newcomers treating dock work as temporary punishment rather than honest profession.

**Criminal Element:** Smugglers, thieves, fugitives hiding among transient population. Take advantage of weak enforcement and officials' corruption. Some operate sophisticated networks; others simple opportunists. Their presence makes everyone more suspicious.

Social advancement happens through hard work and strategic networking. Demonstrating reliability gets you better jobs. Building connections opens opportunities. Saving enough money allows investment in tools or business that might restore status. But progress requires years of grinding effort many can't sustain.

### Daily Rhythms

Morning: Ships arrive with tide. Unloading begins immediately. Workers scramble for day labor opportunities. The Manifest Office processes paperwork (slowly). Merchants inspect incoming goods.

Midday: Dock work continues under hot sun. Those without steady employment compete for afternoon opportunities. Food vendors serve quick, cheap meals. Smugglers conduct careful negotiations in back alleys.

Afternoon: Loading outbound ships. Repairs on docked vessels. Cargo organization in warehouses. Criminal activities increase as official oversight decreases toward evening.

Evening: Day laborers collect meager pay. The Rusty Anchor fills with exhausted workers. Those with night employment prepare for shifts. Smuggling operations accelerate as darkness provides cover.

Night: Reduced legitimate activity. Smugglers move goods through prearranged routes. Desperate people conduct business best hidden from daylight. Official patrols minimal and easily avoided. District's dangerous reputation mostly justified during these hours.

## DM Notes

### Hidden Operations

**The Smuggler's Guild**
Well-organized criminal network controlling most illegal trade through [[Agastia]]'s port. Not officially a guild but operates with similar structure - territories, rules, arbitration of disputes. Pays protection money to corrupt Manifest Office officials ensuring smooth operations. Leadership unknown to most members, creating security through compartmentalization. Smuggles restricted goods, people fleeing authorities, and occasionally chaos cult materials (unknowingly - they just move cargo for money).

**The Tidebreakers**
Secret organization helping those who've fallen from status regain their footing. Provides interest-free loans, job training, connections to opportunities. Funded by wealthy benefactor (identity unknown) who apparently fell once and recovered. Operates carefully - Council would view organized assistance to the fallen as undermining merit system's legitimacy. Those helped rarely know organization's name, just that someone gave them crucial chance.

**[[Chaos Cult]] Smuggling**
Cult uses Dock District to import forbidden materials, infiltrate agents from elsewhere, and export stolen artifacts. Smuggler's Guild unknowingly facilitates some of this through normal operations. Cult also recruits among the fallen, promising restored status through power rather than merit. Some dock workers secretly cultist, using position to move materials.

**The Salvage Rights Dispute**
Complex legal battle over who owns cargo from ships wrecked near [[Agastia]]. Maritime workers claim traditional salvage rights. Council asserts government ownership. Merchants argue their insurance contracts specify claims. Meanwhile, actual salvaging continues with goods sold through black market. Dispute involves enough money that resolution would reshape district's economy.

### Key NPCs

**"Captain" (Real name unknown)**
Rusty Anchor proprietor and unofficial community leader. Ex-ship captain who lost vessel and status in mysterious circumstances he won't discuss. Protects regulars fiercely but stays neutral in larger conflicts. Knows everyone's business through tavern gossip. Maintains careful balance between helping community and avoiding authority attention. Secret supporter of Tidebreakers organization.

**Olric Saltwind**
Proprietor of [[Saltwind General Supply]]. Practical, fair-dealing, maintains honor despite operating in gray legal areas. Family connections to more successful Tier 4 merchants (sister Mira runs Saltwind Imports) but chose to work in Dock District helping those others overlook. Fence for stolen goods but refuses items from violence or chaos cult sources. Intelligence network rivals some nobles' operations.

**"Iron Tooth" Margret**
[[Tidecaller Armory]] owner and former mercenary. Lost status after refusing order she considered morally wrong, accepting discharge rather than compromising principles. Bitter about merit system but channels frustration into helping others prepare for violence's realities. Trains dock workers in self-defense. Provides weapons to those protecting community. Watching for opportunities to expose corruption that led to her fall.

**Doc Harrow**
Sawbones surgeon with genuine medical knowledge despite drinking problem and questionable credentials. Former ship's doctor who lost position due to alcoholism. Treats everyone regardless of ability to pay, accepting barter, IOUs, or future favors. Drunk but functional - steady enough hands when it matters. Knows medical secrets about half the district, creating valuable intelligence source for anyone who could exploit it.

**Inspector Reeve**
Corrupt Manifest Office supervisor coordinating protection arrangements with Smuggler's Guild. Publicly enforces laws selectively. Privately accepts bribes systematically. Ambitious enough to be dangerous - wants promotion out of Dock District, making him willing to betray current arrangements if better opportunity appears. Weak point in smuggling network and potential leverage for party.

### Secret Locations

**The Undertow**
Network of smuggling tunnels beneath docks connecting to [[Agastia]]'s sewer system. Allow goods to move from ships to city interior without surface surveillance. Multiple entrances hidden in warehouses, ships, and buildings. Smuggler's Guild guards access fiercely. Maps incomplete even for regular users - sections flood, collapse, or get sealed deliberately.

**The Salvage Yards**
Supposedly organized storage for legitimate salvage operations. Actually contain black market warehouses where stolen cargo, smuggled goods, and questionable salvage get processed before sale. Manifest Office officials know about this but participate in profits, ensuring no official investigation. Contains items from mundane (untaxed imports) to dangerous (chaos artifacts awaiting transport).

**The Captain's Cache**
Hidden room beneath Rusty Anchor where "Captain" stores money, documents, and favors owed him. Contains evidence of various crimes (insurance against authorities), names of Tidebreakers organization members (protected carefully), and records of everyone helped over the years. Discovery would destroy him but also expose networks throughout [[Agastia]].

**Harrow's Clinic Back Room**
Behind surgery lies surprisingly well-equipped medical facility where Doc Harrow treats serious injuries no questions asked. Fugitives, criminals injured during crimes, victims of violence who can't seek official help. Contains medical supplies stolen or salvaged from various sources. Also houses Doc's journal documenting everything he's seen - names, wounds, implied criminal activities. Valuable and dangerous information.

- **Social:** Fall from status difficult to reverse, desperation grows
- **Economic:** Poverty and exploitation create desperate people
- **Political:** Weak position makes residents vulnerable to anyone with power
- **Chaos:** Multiple cult infiltration vectors, vulnerable population

### Resources

Despite harsh conditions, Dock District offers specific advantages:
- Maritime access for travel and trade
- Smuggling networks move restricted goods and people
- Fallen residents possess knowledge from former higher-tier positions
- Community of survivors develops useful skills and resilience
- Weak oversight allows activities impossible elsewhere
- Information networks tracking ship movements and cargo
- People willing to take risks others won't for right price

The Dock District represents those fighting to prove they deserve second chances. Some succeed through determination and skill. Others spiral further down. Understanding their struggles reveals how merit system handles failure - not with support but with marginalization that sometimes becomes self-fulfilling prophecy.
