# The Depths

## Player Summary

The Depths occupy Agastia's lowest levels - literally underground in ancient tunnels, caverns, and forgotten infrastructure. This is where the Dispossessed dwell: those who've lost all merit status and stopped fighting to regain it. Here, the meritocracy's failures become visible, creating conditions of desperation that simultaneously evoke sympathy and demonstrate why people fall.

Few from higher tiers venture into The Depths without compelling reason. The city's prosperity feels distant down here, replaced by harsh survival realities. Yet even in this darkness, human resilience persists. Communities form. People help each other. Not everyone gave up - some simply can't climb a system designed to keep them down.

### Atmosphere

Darkness broken by improvised lighting - stolen lanterns, makeshift torches, occasional magical lights scavenged or created by former mages. Air smells of dampness, unwashed bodies, cooking fires burning questionable fuel, and underlying rot from inadequate waste disposal.

Tunnels and caverns connect living spaces carved from Agastia's foundations. Some areas occupy ancient sewers. Others use natural caves. A few sections consist of failed construction projects from centuries past - the city's buried mistakes becoming homes for those it failed.

Sound carries strangely in confined spaces. Whispered conversations echo. Arguments become public despite attempts at privacy. Children's laughter sounds incongruous amid general misery. Water drips constantly, marking time in a place without natural day/night cycles.

The Depths feel dangerous and desperate because they are. But they're also resilient - people surviving despite everything stacked against them.

### Notable Establishments

**The Hidden Door**
Underground inn and safe house run by Senna Darkwell (see establishment file). Provides floor space (1cp/night), basic protection, and functioning as communication hub for Dispossessed. No questions asked about past or present activities. Senna maintains strict neutrality, making The Hidden Door one of few spaces relatively safe from violence. Despite rough conditions, represents genuine community support in harsh environment.

**Underground Market**
Black market operating in shifting locations throughout The Depths. Kex the Fence runs largest operation, buying anything without questions (10% of value) and selling stolen goods, illegal items, and questionable "salvage." Poisoned weapons (illegal in Agastia, 50gp for 3 doses), "liberated" magic items (authenticity uncertain), broken artifacts (might work if repaired?). Pure buyer-beware environment but only source for some goods.

**Shadow's Edge Armory**
Black market weapons dealer operated by former soldier known as "Scar." Specializes in illegal and improvised weapons. Sharpened chains (5gp, 1d6 slashing), concealed daggers, poisoned blades, and occasionally stolen military equipment. No services offered - cash only, no returns. Being caught shopping here considered serious crime but enforcement rarely reaches The Depths.

**The Desperate's Refuge**
Unlicensed healing operation run by Mother Cass (elderly woman of unclear background). Offers bandages (1sp, stabilize dying), mystery tonics (5gp, 50% Potion of Healing, 30% nothing, 20% poison), and surgery by lamplight (10gp, as barber-surgeon but DC 15 Con save). Extremely risky but sometimes only option. Mother Cass genuinely wants to help despite lack of resources or training. Treats everyone regardless of ability to pay.

**The Gathering Stone**
Central meeting area in relatively open cavern. The Dispossessed gather here to share information, organize collective action, and maintain community bonds. Informal marketplace operates during day. Evening brings community discussions about survival strategies and resistance possibilities. The stone itself (large natural formation) serves as speaker's platform and symbolic heart of Dispossessed identity.

### Social Dynamics

The Depths population consists of those who lost all merit status through various paths: prolonged failure, serious crimes, deliberate rejection of the system, or circumstances beyond control. Three rough groups exist:

**The Resigned:** Accepted their fall and focus on daily survival. Not fighting the system anymore, just trying to get by. Form small communities of mutual support. Generally avoid illegal activities beyond what's necessary to survive.

**The Bitter:** Blame the system for their situation (sometimes justifiably). Nurse resentment toward higher tiers. Some engage in petty crime against those above. Others organize resistance or radical movements. Vulnerable to chaos cult recruitment promising revenge and power.

**The Criminal:** Chose this life for profit or freedom from rules. Professional thieves, smugglers, fugitives. Use The Depths as base while operating throughout Agastia. More sophisticated than desperate survivors, treating underground as business opportunity rather than punishment.

Merit in The Depths comes from survival skills, useful connections, and willingness to help community. Someone who can pick locks, heal injuries, or find food becomes valuable. Someone who hoards resources or exploits others faces isolation or violence.

Trust develops slowly and remains fragile. Too many betrayals for easy faith. But genuine bonds form among those surviving together. When someone proves reliable, that loyalty runs deep.

### Daily Rhythms

The Depths lack natural light cycles, creating irregular rhythms based on individual needs and upper-city activity patterns:

**Morning (Surface Time):** Those with day jobs in higher tiers depart through hidden passages. Scavengers venture to surface seeking salvage. Underground Market begins operations. Community organizes daily survival needs.

**Midday:** Reduced population as many work elsewhere. Elders, children, and those unable to work remain. Teaching, childcare, and skill-sharing happen informally. Preparation of scavenged food.

**Afternoon:** Early workers return. Market activity increases. Information sharing about surface opportunities or threats. Planning criminal activities for evening.

**Evening:** Peak activity period. The Hidden Door fills with residents seeking company. Gathering Stone hosts community discussions. Black market operations accelerate. Those working night shifts depart.

**Night:** Reduced activity as residents rest. Some areas go nearly dark to save fuel. Criminal operations continue. Guard rotations watch for threats from both surface authorities and other underground groups. Chaos cult activities intensify (they prefer darkness).

## DM Notes

### Hidden Operations

**The Dispossessed Organization**
Despite name suggesting unorganized mass, the Dispossessed maintain surprisingly sophisticated underground network. Leadership council of long-term residents coordinates community defense, resource distribution, and limited infrastructure maintenance. Publicly appear chaotic to avoid attention; privately quite organized. Preparing for day when they might challenge merit system directly - stockpiling weapons, training fighters, building alliances with sympathetic higher-tier residents.

**Chaos Cult's Strongest Foothold**
The Depths provide ideal recruitment environment for chaos cult. Promises of power and revenge appeal to bitter residents. Cult operates multiple cells, some competing rather than cooperating (chaos undermining its own organization). Many recruits don't fully understand what they're joining - just desperate people accepting help offered. Some resist cult influence despite desperation, recognizing corruption when they see it.

**The Underground Railroad**
Secret network helping people flee Agastia when necessary - political fugitives, escaped prisoners, those targeted by powerful enemies. Routes through The Depths connect to external tunnel systems exiting city entirely. Organization carefully vetted - helps genuine refugees, refuses criminals or chaos cultists. Operated by former Council official who realized merit system's fundamental injustices and now sabotages it from below.

**The Archive of Shame**
Hidden collection documenting merit system's failures, abuses, and injustices. Personal testimonies from those cast down unfairly. Evidence of corruption denying people earned status. Records of how merit fraud by elites goes unpunished while poor face harsh penalties for minor infractions. Maintained by Dispossessed historian hoping someday evidence forces systemic reform. Meanwhile, Council would destroy archive if discovered.

### Key NPCs

**Senna Darkwell**
Proprietor of The Hidden Door and community leader among the Resigned faction. Former Tier 4 merchant who lost everything through competitor's sabotage disguised as legitimate competition. Rather than destroy herself through bitterness, channels energy into helping others survive. Maintains network of informants throughout Agastia. Knows everyone in The Depths personally. Protects community fiercely while avoiding direct confrontation with authorities. Secret supporter of Underground Railroad.

**Kex the Fence**
Primary black market operator and representative of Criminal faction. Amoral but fair in dealings - no scams, agreed prices honored, stolen goods only sold to those knowing what they're buying. Former thief who fell not through failure but after refusing to betray partner. Maintains code of honor unusual in criminal world. Unknowingly fences some chaos cult materials among normal stolen goods. Would be horrified if he understood what he's facilitating.

**"Scar" (Real name: Former Captain Darius Stone)**
Shadow's Edge Armory operator and Bitter faction leader. Former military officer discharged for refusing illegal order, then stripped of status when he threatened to expose corruption. Believes merit system fundamentally broken and violent revolution necessary. Trains willing residents in combat. Stockpiles weapons. Plans uprising but lacks resources and support for success. Vulnerable to chaos cult manipulation if they frame revolution properly.

**Mother Cass**
Desperate's Refuge healer and moral center of community. No one knows her full background - stories conflict - but everyone trusts her intentions. Provides healing despite limited resources. Counsels those struggling. Mediates disputes. Somehow maintains hope and compassion despite witnessing constant suffering. May actually possess divine connection (minor cleric abilities) but denies any special power. Actively fights chaos cult's recruitment by strengthening community bonds.

**The Historian (Name: Elara Truthseeker)**
Maintains Archive of Shame and documents systemic injustices. Former government administrator who witnessed corruption firsthand and refused to participate. Gathering evidence methodically, believing eventual exposure will force reform. Correct about problems, possibly naive about solutions - entrenched power rarely reforms voluntarily. Needs protection and should archive be discovered, also needs escape plan.

### Secret Locations

**The Forgotten Vaults**
Ancient chambers from Agastia's founding buried beneath current city. Contain artifacts, documents, and secrets that predate merit system. Access through collapsed passages only those familiar with Depths can navigate. Some items potentially valuable or dangerous. Others simply historically significant. Council doesn't know extent of what lies buried - if they did, they'd seal or claim everything.

**The Resistance Cache**
Scar's hidden armory where weapons and supplies for planned uprising are stockpiled. Contains more than improvised weapons - some military-grade equipment stolen or purchased through connections. Also holds tactical plans, lists of sympathizers in higher tiers, and evidence of corruption to justify rebellion. Discovery would result in immediate crackdown on The Depths.

**The Sanctuary**
Chamber maintained by Mother Cass where seriously injured or ill can recover with minimal care available. Supplied through donations and scavenging. Protects vulnerable during recovery. Also serves as temporary refuge for those fleeing immediate danger. Mother Cass defends sanctuary absolutely - she's killed attackers before to protect patients, though she regrets violence.

**The Exit Passages**
Tunnel network connecting to routes leaving Agastia entirely. Used by Underground Railroad to evacuate those who must flee. Multiple exit points outside city provide options. Some passages partially collapsed, requiring careful navigation. Council knows smuggling routes exist but hasn't mapped them completely. Those knowing full network hold valuable and dangerous knowledge.

- **Political:** Authorities view entire population as criminal by default
- **Chaos:** Heaviest cult infiltration, widespread corruption
- **Moral:** Witnessing suffering tests party's values and priorities
- **Practical:** Everything in Depths carries risk - food, water, shelter all uncertain

### Resources

Despite extreme conditions, The Depths offer unexpected advantages:
- Black market access to illegal, stolen, or restricted goods
- Information networks tracking city from bottom up
- Hidden routes throughout Agastia and beyond
- People desperate enough to take risks for right cause
- Perspective on merit system's failures and injustices
- Community bonds forged through shared survival
- Skills developed when normal resources unavailable

The Depths represent Agastia's greatest failure and greatest opportunity. Failure because civilized meritocracy produced this suffering. Opportunity because if these people's potential could be unlocked, they'd strengthen city enormously. Understanding The Depths means confronting uncomfortable questions about whether merit system creates justice or just rationalizes inequality.

Some Dispossessed deserve their fall. Many don't. Most exist somewhere between - people who failed, made mistakes, or couldn't overcome circumstances, then found themselves in system designed to keep them down rather than help them rise. How party responds to The Depths reveals their true values more than any test in comfort could.
