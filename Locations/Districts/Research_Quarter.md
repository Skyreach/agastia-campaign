# Research Quarter

## Player Summary

The Research Quarter occupies the elevated tiers just below the Castle, home to Agastia's magical and academic elite. Where the Castle represents political power, the Research Quarter embodies intellectual and arcane achievement. Access requires demonstrated magical aptitude, academic credentials, or official sponsorship.

The district combines cutting-edge magical research facilities with exclusive establishments serving those who've achieved the highest merit through scholarly or arcane accomplishment. The atmosphere balances studious focus with subtle displays of magical mastery.

### Atmosphere

Floating lights illuminate streets at precise intervals. Magical constructs perform mundane tasks - sweeping steps, delivering messages, maintaining order. The air carries a faint ozone scent from constant magical activity. Conversations mix academic jargon with theoretical debates.

Buildings showcase architectural innovation impossible without magic: structures that subtly shift configuration, gardens growing in mid-air, doorways leading to spaces larger than their exterior suggests. Everything demonstrates what's possible when magical knowledge meets substantial resources.

Unlike the Castle's formal rigidity, the Research Quarter maintains professional but collegial atmosphere. Residents bond over shared intellectual pursuits while competing for prestige, funding, and discoveries.

### Notable Establishments

**Blades of Glory**
The premier magical arms and armor establishment in Agastia, featuring Very Rare and Legendary items. Master enchanters craft custom weapons and armor, offering permanent enchantments unavailable elsewhere in the city. The signature "Blade of Glory" - an adaptable, shape-shifting sword worth 25,000gp - represents the pinnacle of their craft. Guild membership provides access to exclusive commissions and master-level enchanting services. Access requires invitation, major quest completion, or reaching level 10+.

**Augury Spire**
A crystalline tower where diviners and prophets study the future through various arcane techniques. Legitimate augury services available for those who can afford them - though even paying customers receive carefully phrased, ambiguous guidance. The Spire maintains extensive records of prophecies and their outcomes, studying patterns in fate itself. Some whisper the Spire's true purpose involves detecting chaos cult activities before they manifest.

**Grand Cathedral**
The primary temple serving all recognized faiths in Agastia, staffed by high-level clerics and paladins. Offers powerful divine magic including Greater Restoration (450gp), Raise Dead (1,250gp), and Regenerate (1,300gp). The cathedral's political neutrality makes it trusted ground for interfaith dialogue and sensitive negotiations. Healing services available to all who can pay, though wealthy patrons subsidize emergency care for those in desperate need.

**The Resonance Library**
Exclusive magical library containing spellbooks, research notes, and theoretical texts from Agastia's greatest mages. Access restricted to verified magical practitioners. The library's true treasures lie in restricted sections requiring special permission - original research from the seven founders, experimental spell designs deemed too dangerous for general access, and comprehensive studies on chaos magic.

**Magewright Consortium**
Professional guild for enchanters, artificers, and other magical craftspeople. Maintains strict quality standards and ethical guidelines. Guild members create the magical infrastructure keeping Agastia functional - from ward maintenance to enchanted plumbing. Also handles commissions for magical items and custom enchantments (at appropriate tier levels).

### Social Dynamics

Merit in the Research Quarter derives from magical knowledge, academic achievement, and arcane innovation. A brilliant enchanter carries more social weight than a wealthy merchant. Published research matters more than family connections.

Competition runs intense but usually remains professional. Researchers race for discoveries. Enchanters compete for prestigious commissions. Diviners argue about methodology and interpretation. But this competition generally stays within bounds - sabotaging rivals' work or stealing research crosses serious ethical lines enforced by peer pressure and guild sanctions.

Residents view themselves as Agastia's intellectual foundation. They provide the magical expertise keeping the city functional, the research driving innovation, and the arcane defenses protecting against supernatural threats. This creates both justified pride and occasional arrogance toward "lesser minds" in lower tiers.

### Daily Rhythms

Morning: Research begins early. Laboratories activate. Libraries open to verified scholars. Magical experiments commence under proper containment protocols.

Midday: Academic discussions over lunch. Collaboration sessions. Teaching for those training apprentices. Consultation appointments for clients seeking magical services.

Afternoon: Peak research hours. Enchanting work requiring precise focus. Augury sessions (best results during afternoon light, according to diviners).

Evening: Social gatherings where academics discuss work informally. Seminars presenting new findings. Demonstrations of innovative enchantments. Professional networking disguised as collegial socializing.

Night: Secure facilities conduct sensitive experiments. Night shift maintains surveillance and defensive wards. Advanced students work late in laboratories. Some research requires darkness or specific astronomical conditions.

## DM Notes

### Hidden Operations

**The Containment Vaults**
Deep below the Research Quarter lie vaults holding magical artifacts too dangerous for display or study but too valuable to destroy. Failed experimental enchantments that achieved sentience. Cursed items recovered from chaos cult operations. Artifacts from other planes that corrupt those who use them. Academic curiosity wars with prudent containment - researchers constantly petition for access to study these items, arguing that understanding them might prevent future threats.

**Project Farsight**
Secret augury initiative attempting to predict chaos cult activities before they occur. The Augury Spire's public services fund this classified program. Results remain frustratingly inconsistent - chaos by nature resists prediction, making patterns unreliable. Recent divinations suggest major chaos incursion approaching, but specifics remain unclear. Council receiving regular briefings but hasn't decided whether to act on uncertain prophecies.

**The Resonance Library's Forbidden Section**
Deepest section of library contains research on chaos magic itself. Original founders believed understanding chaos required studying it directly - dangerous knowledge they preserved for emergencies. Current librarians maintain this collection while restricting access. Some researchers have secretly accessed these texts, rationalizing that fighting chaos requires understanding it. This flawed reasoning has led to corruption before.

**Magical Arms Race**
Blades of Glory and similar establishments receive council funding to develop enhanced combat capabilities, driven by increasing chaos cult activity. Projects include weapons specifically harmful to chaos-touched creatures, armor resisting corruption, and detection systems identifying cultists. Research proceeds quietly to avoid alarming population while preparing for escalating conflict.

### Key NPCs

**Master Enchanter Kaelith Brightspark**
Proprietor of Blades of Glory and one of Agastia's most accomplished magical craftspeople. Passionate about pushing enchanting to theoretical limits. Maintains extensive network among adventurers and elite warriors who field-test experimental designs. Politically neutral but concerned about chaos cult's growing boldness. Offers substantial rewards for rare materials recovered from dangerous locations.

**High Diviner Seraph Moonwhisper**
Director of Augury Spire and leader of Project Farsight. Haunted by prophecies showing catastrophic futures, frustrated by inability to pinpoint specifics. Walks ethical tightrope between warning people and causing panic. Some colleagues question whether constant exposure to possible futures has damaged her judgment.

**Cardinal Theron Lightbringer**
High priest of the Grand Cathedral, managing complex interfaith politics while maintaining the cathedral's neutrality. Former adventuring paladin who understands violence's realities. Concerned that cathedral's resources increasingly support combat preparation rather than healing and community service. Provides healing to all who need it, regardless of faction, creating complicated political situations.

**Chief Librarian Erasmus Tome**
Oversees the Resonance Library and controls access to restricted sections. Scholar who values knowledge preservation above almost everything else. Privately believes all knowledge should eventually become accessible, making him sympathetic to researchers seeking restricted materials. Maintains detailed records of who accesses what, creating valuable intelligence source for anyone who could obtain those records.

### Secret Locations

**The Testing Chambers**
Sealed rooms with enhanced containment where magical experiments too dangerous for standard laboratories are conducted. Reinforced walls, automatic suppression systems, emergency teleportation protocols. Only authorized researchers access these spaces. Some experiments continue running long after researchers who initiated them have died or moved on - magical processes that cannot be safely interrupted.

**The Prophecy Archive**
Vault within Augury Spire containing recorded prophecies dating back to Agastia's founding. Pattern analysis suggests cycles of chaos activity, implying current crisis isn't unprecedented. Archive includes prophecies that proved false or haven't yet manifested - distinguishing signal from noise remains challenge. Some oldest prophecies reference events that haven't occurred yet, suggesting very long timescales or conditional futures.

**Brightspark's Private Forge**
Kaelith's personal workshop where she crafts masterwork items. Contains rare materials, experimental designs, and prototypes never publicly displayed. Security rivals Castle's most protected locations. Workshop itself is partially extra-dimensional, providing more space than physical structure suggests. Hidden section contains her failed experiments - items that didn't work as intended but might still prove valuable or dangerous.
