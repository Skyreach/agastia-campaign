## Travel to Agastia (2-3 Days)

**Route:** [[Meridian's Rest]] → [[Agastia]]
**Distance:** ~48 miles (2 hexes at 24mi/hex world scale)
**Travel Time:** 2-3 days at normal pace (24 mi/day)
**Terrain:** Temperate Forests

**Encounter Table:** See [[Inspiring Tables#Temperate Forests (Tier 1)]]

### Day 1: The Bloody Crate ([[Kyle/Nameless]]'s Hook)

**Encounter:** The party comes across an overturned cart on the side of the road. A wounded man is hiding nearby.

> The road ahead is partially blocked by an overturned cart, its contents spilled across the dirt. A single crate, stained with a dark, still-wet substance, lies a short distance away. A faint groan can be heard from the nearby woods.

**The Wounded Man:**
- A low-level smuggler, ambushed by rivals.
- He was supposed to deliver the crate to "[[Geist]]" at the [[Agastia]] docks.
- He is dying and will only be able to utter a few words: "[[Geist]]... Warehouse 7... Docks...".
- **The Crate:** Contains mundane goods, but has a small, almost invisible symbol of a coiled serpent on it. This is a marker for [[Geist]]'s operation.

**DM Notes:**
- This provides a direct hook for [[Kyle/Nameless]] (Nameless) to the docks and Warehouse 7.
- The symbol on the crate can be used to identify other parts of the smuggling operation in [[Agastia]].

### Day 2: Player's Choice

**Encounter:** Choose one of the following from the Inspiring Table or create a new one based on player actions.

**Option 1: The Lost Mastiff (from Inspiring Table)**
- A chance for a non-combat encounter and to gain a loyal animal companion.

**Option 2: The Wandering Druid (from Inspiring Table)**
- An opportunity for healing, information, and a potential side quest.

**Option 3: The Goblin Ambush Site (from Inspiring Table)**
- A classic combat encounter.

### Day 3: Arrival in Agastia

> The road crests a hill, and the city of [[Agastia]] unfolds before you. A tiered metropolis of stone and ambition, with the towering Northern Wall and the sky-piercing Inverse Tower. Airships drift lazily from the upper docks, their magical sails aglow.

## Welcome to Agastia

### Navigation & Connections

**Point Crawl System:** See `Resources/Point_Crawl_Network.md` for complete network with all connections and path descriptions.

**Key Navigation Nodes:**

**At Central Plaza (Job Board):**
> "Standing in Central Plaza where the Job Board is posted, do you:
> - Walk south to the murder scene (2 blocks, past silk merchant and bakery)?
> - Go west on Market Street to Il Drago Rosso (3 blocks, past armory and tavern)?
> - Head east toward the docks (4 blocks, descending on Merchant's Way)?
> - Travel north toward Scholar's Gate (5 blocks on Academy Avenue)?"

**Moving from Job Board to Il Drago Rosso:**
> "You walk west on Market Street. You pass [[Shadow's Edge Armory]] where a blacksmith hammers at an anvil, then a curiosity dealer's window full of strange trinkets, and finally a crowded tavern where laughter spills into the street. Three blocks from the plaza, you spot the red dragon banner hanging above a warm, inviting doorway."

**Moving from Job Board to Murder Scene:**
> "You walk south past the silk merchant's colorful awnings and the warm smell of fresh bread from Goldwheat Bakery. Between them, a narrow alley opens to your right - dark and quiet compared to the busy street."

**Between Districts (City Scale):**

**From Merchant District to Scholar Quarter:**
> "You walk north on Academy Avenue, passing bookbinders and cartographers as the shops shift toward academic trades. The street narrows and quietens. Ahead, worn stone steps rise through Scholar's Gate, an archway adorned with carved books. You climb into the academic district, where the air smells of parchment and ink."

**From Merchant District to Dock District:**
> "Harbor Road slopes downward toward the waterfront. The smell of salt and fish grows stronger as merchant stalls give way to warehouses and chandleries. You descend three tiers of switchback streets, each level rougher than the last."

**From Merchant District to Noble Quarter:**
> "You cross the Gold Bridge, an elegant stone span over the Inner Canal. Guards in ceremonial armor watch from both ends, noting your presence. The architecture becomes more ornate as you enter the estates district."

**DM Note:** Use these descriptions when players move between locations. Full point crawl network in `Resources/Point_Crawl_Network.md` includes all connections, distances, landmarks, and path descriptions for improvisation.

## Player Quest Hooks

### The Ghost of Elaris (NEW - Emerged from Travel Encounter)

**Setup:** During the long rest after saving the noble elf from the spider's hunting ground, the party is visited by the ghost of the young elf found dead in the cocoons.

> As you settle into your rest, the temperature drops sharply. A translucent figure materializes near the fire—a young elf, their form flickering like candlelight. They look at you with desperate, hollow eyes.

**The Ghost's Plea:**
- Name: **Elaris Moonwhisper**, child of the noble elf **Lord Thalorien Moonwhisper** (whom the party rescued)
- Elaris was traveling with their father when the spiders attacked
- Before dying, Elaris saw something disturbing: "The spiders... they weren't hunting. They were herding us. Driving us toward the old hollow."
- **Quest Goal:** Investigate the "old hollow" and discover what was controlling the spiders

**Investigation Path:**
1. **Track the Pattern:** DC 14 Survival check reveals the spider webs formed a deliberate funnel, driving travelers west
2. **The Old Hollow:** A corrupted grove 1 hour west of the road
   - Ancient oak split and oozing shadow (similar to encounter #14 but more advanced)
   - A **Wood Woad** corrupted by shadow magic guards the tree
   - At the tree's base: A ritual circle and evidence someone has been feeding the tree victims
3. **The Culprit:** Investigation reveals signs of a robed figure visiting regularly ([[Chaos Cult]] member experimenting with corruption magic)

**Rewards:**
- **Elaris's Blessing:** Once per long rest, a character can call upon Elaris for advantage on a death saving throw
- **Lord Thalorien's Gratitude:** 150 gp reward and an invitation to House Moonwhisper in Agastia (Tier 2 Noble Quarter)
- **Information:** Evidence of [[Chaos Cult]] activity in the forest (connects to larger campaign)

**DM Notes:**
- This quest can be completed before or after arriving in Agastia
- Lord Thalorien will not know his child is dead until the party tells him (emotional scene)
- The [[Chaos Cult]] connection can be discovered via Religion/Arcana DC 15 on the ritual circle
- Wood Woad stats: AC 18, HP 75, resistant to bludgeoning/piercing

### [[Manny]] (Monomi) - [[The Codex]] Quest

- The Job Board has a request from a scholar in the [[Scholar Quarter]] (Tier 3) to retrieve a rare book from a dangerous ruin. This could be a lead to the [[Archive of Lost Histories]].
- A rumor overheard in a tavern mentions a strange, ancient elf named [[Veridian]] who knows everything about [[Agastia]]'s history.

### [[Nikki]] (Biago) - Family and Friends

- [[Nikki]]'s family restaurant, [[Il Drago Rosso]], is a source of information and a safe haven.
- A job on the board asks for someone to discreetly investigate a new, aggressive faction trying to strong-arm businesses in the [[Merchant District]], potentially threatening her family's restaurant.

## Session End

The session ends with the party in [[Agastia]], with several open threads:
- Investigating the [[Steel Dragon]]'s murder.
- Following the lead to [[Geist]] and the [[Dock District]].
- Taking a job from the job board.
- Pursuing their personal quests.
