- **Levels 1-9:** Campaign scope defined
- **Player Contributions:** Ongoing world-building encouraged

### Central Conflict Established

**The Steel Dragon:**

**Supporting Elements:**

## Notes for Campaign Development

**Player Engagement:**
Players actively contributed to world-building, showing investment in collaborative storytelling. Their location and landmark contributions should be integrated into future sessions.

**Character Connections:**
The pre-existing relationships (Kyle-Rakash, Manny-Nikki) provide strong foundation. Additional connections developed during Session 0 create party cohesion.

**Homebrew Integration:**
- Rainbow race mechanics finalized and balanced
- Josh's mysterious markings set up as campaign mystery
- Bonus feat adds character customization without breaking balance
- Bastion system provides downtime structure

**Campaign Scope:**
Levels 2-9 provides clear endpoint, allowing focused story arc. Light story approach with moral dilemmas matches player preferences. 40/60 combat/exploration ratio emphasizes investigation and roleplay.

**Next Steps:**
- Integrate player-created locations into regional maps and adventures
- Develop patron NPC for Session 1 hiring
- Prepare Ratterdan encounter details
- Create character-specific moments for Session 1 spotlight
