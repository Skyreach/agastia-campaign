# Session 2: Planning (Work In Progress)

**Status:** Brainstorming campaign fronts and quest hooks
**Date:** 2025-01-20

---

## Session 2 Goals

### Player Goal Integration
1. **Rakash's "I know a guy" moment** - Contact links to first patron (TBD)
2. **Nameless' backstory seeds** - Events involving Geist and Kaelborn
3. **Temporal Bloodline & Codex hooks** - Decimate members progression
4. **Brand Al'Thor's lost civilization** - Hints at what happened
5. **Fantastic element introduction** - Memorable arcane spectacle

### Design Constraints
- ❌ **Octavia NOT revealed as rival** - Escalating threat, not sudden discovery
- ❌ **Octavia does NOT have Codex** - She'd just deliver it to Zero
- ✅ **Geist & Kaelborn CAN appear but MUST be inaccessible** - Merit Council protection? Diplomatic immunity?
- ✅ **Codex in fragments** - Artifact with another purpose, extraction destroys it
- ✅ **Storm Giant works with faction** - Kingdom-level problem, possibly related to G&K
- ✅ **Progressive fronts** - Steps toward doom, not endpoints
- ✅ **Level 2 appropriate** - They're nobodies, small fish

### Quest Design Philosophy
Each quest should connect **ALL 5 player goals** in different ways:
- Rakash's contact/patron connection
- Kyle's bandit hunt (Geist/Kaelborn)
- Brand's civilization clues
- Nikki/Manny's Codex retrieval
- Fantastic arcane spectacle

## Campaign Fronts (Dungeon World Style)

### FRONT 1: "The Breathing City"

**Arcane Spectacle**: Buildings in Agastia have started BREATHING. Walls expand/contract rhythmically. Stone sweats. Architecture groans.

**The Impending Doom**: Agastia will become a LIVING CREATURE and walk away, leaving citizens stranded.

**Grim Portents** (Progressive stages):
1. Stone structures develop pulse-like vibrations (happening now)
2. Buildings grow crude sensory organs (eyes in walls, etc.)
3. Streets rearrange themselves overnight
4. City begins developing nervous system
5. Agastia gains sentience and mobility

**Player Goal Connections**:
- **Rakash's Contact**: Dwarven stonemason notices pattern - giant runes carved into foundations are AWAKENING SEQUENCE
- **Kyle/Nameless**: **Geist is Merit Council's "Urban Planning Commissioner"** - blocking investigation, has immunity
- **Brand**: His markings react VIOLENTLY near certain buildings - his civilization CREATED this magic as defense mechanism
- **Nikki/Manny**: Codex fragment in city's "heart" (central monument) - removing it might stop transformation OR accelerate it
- **Storm Giants**: "The Living Throne Compact" - they WANT city to awaken, have treaty with living cities
- **Steel Dragon**: Cult is carving ADDITIONAL runes to speed process - dragon wants mobile city-creature as weapon
- **Heartstone/Octavia**: She was testing if Heartstone animation magic could REVERSE the awakening (failed experiment)

**Session 2 Hook**: Party hired to investigate "structural problems" in Merchant Quarter - discover breathing walls, must trace runes to source

### FRONT 2: "The Drowning Sky"

**Arcane Spectacle**: Ocean water is appearing IN THE SKY above Agastia. Starts as mist, now there are FLOATING POOLS of seawater hundreds of feet up. Fish swim through air. Rain falls UPWARD.

**The Impending Doom**: Sky and sea will INVERT - ocean becomes sky, air becomes sea. Everyone drowns in atmosphere.

**Grim Portents**:
1. Mist in upper atmosphere (happening now)
2. Floating water pools appear
3. Upward rainfall begins
4. Sky develops tides and currents
5. Gravity inverts for liquids
6. Total inversion - breathable water above, drowning air below

**Player Goal Connections**:
- **Rakash's Contact**: Storm giant faction engineer needs help - inversion is ACCIDENTAL side effect of weather control
- **Kyle/Nameless**: **Kaelborn is "Atmospheric Studies Scholar"** with Merit funding - knows how to stop it but WON'T
- **Brand**: His people used "The Tidal Keystone" to prevent this - it's in Scholar Quarter fountain (contains Codex pages)
- **Nikki/Manny**: Removing Codex might stop inversion OR trigger it immediately - Professor Zero doesn't care which
- **Storm Giants**: "The Tempest Assembly" was trying to control rain for agriculture - broke reality instead
- **Steel Dragon**: Cult is HELPING the inversion - dragon is aquatic subspecies, wants underwater Agastia
- **Heartstone/Octavia**: Testing if Heartstone could animate water elementals to stabilize sky (contamination was side effect)

**Session 2 Hook**: Party sees fish swimming through air, hired to investigate fountain where upward rain originates

---

### FRONT 3: "The Memory Plague"

**Arcane Spectacle**: People's memories are becoming VISIBLE. Thoughts manifest as ghostly scenes around heads. Secrets float like auroras. Past traumas replay as illusions. City is drowning in visible history.

**The Impending Doom**: All memories merge into collective consciousness - individual identity ERASES, everyone becomes hive mind.

**Grim Portents**:
1. Surface thoughts visible as shimmer (happening now)
2. Strong memories manifest as ghostly scenes
3. Memories become tangible - can be stolen/destroyed
4. People start experiencing others' memories as their own
5. Identity barriers dissolve
6. Complete ego death - city becomes single consciousness

**Player Goal Connections**:
- **Rakash's Contact**: Goblin refugees' trauma memories are OVERWHELMING them - Ratterdan destruction replays constantly
- **Kyle/Nameless**: **Geist's memories are VISIBLE** - Kyle can SEE his crimes but can't prove them (memories aren't legal evidence). He's "Witness Protection Director" with Merit immunity
- **Brand**: His markings are MEMORY REPOSITORIES from his civilization - plague is activating them, showing their fall
- **Nikki/Manny**: Codex fragment in asylum's "Quiet Room" keeps memories contained - removing it spreads plague citywide
- **Storm Giants**: "The Mindstorm Concord" - using plague to read Merit Council's strategic memories (psychic espionage)
- **Steel Dragon**: Cult spreading plague deliberately - dragon wants to EAT the collective memory (gains knowledge of entire city)
- **Heartstone/Octavia**: Heartstone grants memories/feats - she was testing if it could CURE the plague (backfired, made it worse)

**Session 2 Hook**: Party members start seeing each other's memories, hired to investigate asylum where plague started

---

### FRONT 4: "The Frozen Moments"

**Arcane Spectacle**: TIME is crystallizing. Moments freeze into gem-like structures. People trapped mid-action like statues. Frozen time can be HARVESTED and sold. Temporal smuggling market emerges.

**The Impending Doom**: All of Agastia freezes into single eternal moment - becomes city-sized time crystal, everyone trapped forever.

**Grim Portents**:
1. Random 1-second freezes affect individuals (happening now)
2. Frozen moments last minutes, leave crystalline residue
3. Entire rooms/buildings freeze for hours
4. Frozen time becomes solid enough to mine
5. Freezes last days, crystals grow into structures
6. Total temporal lock - eternal frozen moment

**Player Goal Connections**:
- **Rakash's Contact**: Giant's axe is CAUSING this - temporal magic leaking from weapon, Ian must learn to control it
- **Kyle/Nameless**: **Kaelborn is "Temporal Quarantine Supervisor"** - controlling who gets frozen/unfrozen, has Merit immunity
- **Brand**: His markings show his people weren't displaced to Underdark - they're FROZEN IN TIME somewhere, this is related
- **Nikki/Manny**: Codex in clocktower contains temporal magic - removing it might stop freezes OR shatter all frozen people
- **Storm Giants**: "The Eternal Storm Summit" - they're BUYING frozen time crystals to extend their lifespans
- **Steel Dragon**: Cult wants to freeze specific moment - dragon's perfect victory, eternal reign
- **Heartstone/Octavia**: Heartstone can animate frozen people temporarily - she was testing rescue method

**Session 2 Hook**: Party witness person freeze mid-sentence, hired to investigate clocktower where freezes are most frequent

---

### FRONT 5: "The Hungry Archive"

**Arcane Spectacle**: BOOKS ARE EATING KNOWLEDGE FROM PEOPLE'S MINDS. Scholar Quarter residents wake up illiterate. Experts forget their skills. Library is GROWING, absorbing minds into pages.

**The Impending Doom**: All knowledge transfers into books - people become blank slates, library becomes sentient god of information.

**Grim Portents**:
1. Literacy fading from random citizens (happening now)
2. Professional skills absorbed into technical manuals
3. Personal memories written into autobiographies without consent
4. People can't remember anything not written down
5. Library grows physically, absorbs surrounding buildings
6. Complete transfer - empty people, omniscient library

**Player Goal Connections**:
- **Rakash's Contact**: Dwarven engineer forgot how to repair Ian's prosthetics - knowledge stolen by book
- **Kyle/Nameless**: **Geist is HEAD LIBRARIAN** - can weaponize knowledge theft, has Merit protection as "educator"
- **Brand**: His civilization's ENTIRE HISTORY is being absorbed - if he doesn't act fast, it'll be lost even from his markings
- **Nikki/Manny**: Codex is the LIBRARY'S CORE - it's consuming other books to become complete, removing it might stop OR enrage it
- **Storm Giants**: "The Lorewarden Covenant" - they're FEEDING the library their enemies' military knowledge
- **Steel Dragon**: Cult protecting library - dragon wants to BECOME the library, absorb all knowledge
- **Heartstone/Octavia**: She was testing if Heartstone could store memories OUTSIDE the library (create backup)

**Session 2 Hook**: Party member forgets how to read, hired to investigate Scholar Quarter where knowledge drain is worst

---

### FRONT 6: "The Singing Stones"

**Arcane Spectacle**: Every stone in Agastia is SINGING. Different pitches create harmony/dissonance. Buildings hum. Cobblestones chime when stepped on. The SONG IS GETTING LOUDER - painful frequencies emerging.

**The Impending Doom**: Song reaches resonant frequency - shatters all stone in city simultaneously, Agastia collapses into rubble.

**Grim Portents**:
1. Faint humming from stone structures (happening now)
2. Song audible, causes headaches
3. Harmonics shatter windows and pottery
4. Song loud enough to damage hearing
5. Resonant frequencies crack foundations
6. Final crescendo - total structural collapse

**Player Goal Connections**:
- **Rakash's Contact**: Giant's axe is CONDUCTING the song - weapon responds to stone, Ian must silence it or control it
- **Kyle/Nameless**: **Geist is "Acoustic Safety Inspector"** - knows which buildings will collapse first, won't evacuate (extortion), Merit protected
- **Brand**: Song is in his civilization's LANGUAGE - stones are broadcasting their history/warning before destruction
- **Nikki/Manny**: Codex in "The Tuning Tower" (ancient structure) is the CONDUCTOR - removing it might stop song OR cause immediate collapse
- **Storm Giants**: "The Thunder Chorus" - they're using song to FIND something buried beneath city (seismic scanning)
- **Steel Dragon**: Cult is amplifying the song - dragon wants city destroyed to access what's beneath
- **Heartstone/Octavia**: She was testing if Heartstone could absorb vibrations (dampen the song) - failed, made it worse

**Session 2 Hook**: Party's heads ache from stone-song, hired to find source in Merchant Quarter where singing is loudest

---

## Top Front Candidates for Full Development

**Primary Recommendation:**
1. **Front 4: Frozen Moments** - Directly ties to Ian's giant axe AND Brand's civilization fate, visual spectacle of time crystals
2. **Front 3: Memory Plague** - Kyle can SEE Geist's crimes but can't act, Heartstone connection clear, Steel Dragon wants to eat memories
3. **Front 6: Singing Stones** - Ian's axe is causing it (immediate responsibility), Brand's people speaking through stones, collapse stakes

---

## Open Questions for DM

1. Which front(s) should be developed fully for Session 2?
2. Should we combine elements from multiple fronts?
3. Who is Rakash's patron contact? (Dwarven stonemason? Engineer? Someone else?)
4. What is the Heartstone's true purpose in Octavia's plans?
5. How does Steel Dragon Cult fit into the chosen front?
6. What level of involvement should G&K have in Session 2? (Glimpse vs. interaction)
7. Should Storm Giant faction be introduced directly or through proxies?

---

## Next Steps

1. Select 1-2 fronts to develop fully
2. Design specific Session 2 nodes/encounters
3. Create patron NPC for Rakash's contact
4. Detail how Codex extraction works mechanically
5. Plan Geist/Kaelborn appearance (how they're protected)
6. Determine what Brand learns about his civilization
7. Design fantastic setpiece encounter

## Session 2 Structure Template (Placeholder)

Once front is selected, structure will follow:

### Node 1: Opening Hook
[Fantastic spectacle introduction]

### Node 2: Investigation
[Party discovers connection to all 5 player goals]

### Node 3: Confrontation
[Encounter with protected antagonist OR environmental challenge]

### Node 4: Revelation
[Major discovery about front + player backstories]

### Node 5: Choice
[Remove Codex? Trust patron? Stop the threat?]

---

## Design Notes

### Heartstone Purpose (Octavia's Experiments)
- Testing animation magic applications
- Attempting to counter/reverse various threats
- Failed experiments create contamination
- She's trying to PROTECT people from these fronts?
- Or gathering data for Professor Zero?

### Merit Council Protection for G&K
- Diplomatic immunity (foreign agents?)
- Essential positions (library curator, safety inspector, etc.)
- Political connections make them untouchable
- Evidence needed to overcome protection
- Killing them = party becomes fugitives

### Codex Fragment Locations
- Embedded in essential city infrastructure
- Removing it causes catastrophic side effects
- Creates moral dilemma: retrieve Codex vs. save city
- Forces creative solutions (can they copy it? stabilize it?)

### Storm Giant Faction Integration
- "The [Title] Compact/Assembly/Covenant"
- Legitimate treaty claims OR covert manipulation?
- Using fronts to destabilize Merit Council
- Rakash's giant is agent of this faction
- Kingdom-level threat requiring political solution

---

## Campaign Continuity

### From Session 1
- Giant's axe claimed by Rakash (temporal magic)
- Heartstone transformed into "Bloody" (companion)
- Octavia's laugh recognized by Nikki
- Map to Lonely Mountain found
- Party reached level 2

### Leading to Session 3+
- Front continues escalating (grim portents progress)
- G&K become recurring protected antagonists
- Storm Giant faction becomes major plot
- Brand's civilization mystery deepens
- Codex fragments scattered across city
