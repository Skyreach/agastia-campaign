# Session 1: Caravan to Ratterdan

## Session Overview
The party's first adventure begins with the patron introducing them to their mission: investigate the ruins of Ratterdan where a storm giant has left a massive axe that's "bleeding reality" and causing dangerous temporal distortions.

## Key Objectives
- **Patron Introduction:** Establish hiring NPC and their connection to the party
- **Mission Briefing:** Giant's axe at Ratterdan causing temporal/planar distortions
- **Travel Sequence:** Character spotlight moments on journey to Ratterdan
- **Investigation:** Arrival at ruins, examining the phenomenon
- **First Encounter:** Combat or challenge appropriate for level 2 party
- **Decision Point:** What to do about the axe and their findings

## PRE-SESSION REQUIREMENTS

### CRITICAL DECISIONS STILL NEEDED:
1. **Patron Selection:** [See The_Patron.md - MUST BE CHOSEN before session]
2. **Feat Ceremony:** How is the bonus feat narratively presented?
3. **First Encounter:** Choose from temporal wisps, warped creatures, or rival seekers

## Session Structure

### Opening Scene: Patron Meeting & Feat Ceremony (30-40 minutes)
**Location:** Agastia (specific venue based on patron choice)

**Part 1 - Feat Recognition:**
- Patron acknowledges each PC's exceptional abilities
- Narrative explanation for bonus feat (training, natural talent, magical gift, etc.)
- Brief spotlight for each character demonstrating their feat
- Establishes party as exceptional even at low level

**Part 2 - Mission Briefing:**
- **The Situation:** Storm giant destroyed village of Ratterdan
- **The Artifact:** Giant left massive axe embedded at the site
- **The Problem:** Axe is "bleeding reality" - temporal distortions, planar effects
- **The Mission:** Investigate, assess the danger, retrieve or secure if possible
- **The Payment:** [Based on patron's resources and motivations]
- **The Timeline:** Urgent but not immediate crisis

**Key Information Provided:**
- Ratterdan location and general route
- Reports of strange phenomena (upward-falling leaves, time distortions)
- Giant tracks leading away from site (deliberately left, not fleeing)
- No survivors found, village destroyed methodically
- Unknown whether giant might return

**Party Questions:** Allow PCs to gather information and establish dynamics

### Travel Phase: Journey to Ratterdan (30-45 minutes)
**Route:** Agastia to Ratterdan (exact path depends on geography)

**Goals:**
- Character spotlight moments
- World-building and faction introduction
- Establish tone and pacing
- Foreshadowing of campaign themes

**Character Spotlight Opportunities:**
- **Manny:** Eldritch Knight skills, Merit Council perspective, Codex mission hint
- **Nikki:** Arcane knowledge, relationship with Manny, Codex mission hint
- **Rakash:** Barbarian instincts, connection to Kyle, goblin perspective
- **Kyle:** Ranger/Rogue abilities, rainbow nature's reaction to environment
- **Josh:** Mysterious markings, sorcerous power, player engagement moment

**Possible Encounters (Choose 1-2):**
1. **Refugees fleeing danger:** Opportunity for roleplay and information
2. **Merit Council patrol:** Introduce faction, establish authority/tension
3. **Environmental challenge:** Test party skills, show cooperation
4. **Distant signs of chaos:** Foreshadow cult activity without direct encounter
5. **Merchant caravan:** World-building, potential resources or information

**Approaching Ratterdan:**
- Describe smoking crater visible from distance
- Strange shimmer in the air (reality distortion)
- Unnatural quiet (ecosystem disrupted)
- Sense of wrongness increasing as they approach

### Arrival: Ratterdan Ruins (45-60 minutes)
**Initial Description:**
- Smoking crater where village once stood
- Destroyed buildings scattered around periphery
- Giant's axe embedded at center, massive and imposing
- Reality visibly warping around the artifact
- Upward-falling leaves in pocket of Feywild energy
- Giant tracks leading deliberately away

**Investigation Phase:**

**The Axe Itself:**
- Sized for storm giant, bluish-silver metal
- Embedded deliberately, not dropped or thrown
- Reality "bleeding" effect visible - temporal distortions
- Zhaask (Draconic) symbols etched near base
- Approaching requires navigating distortion zones

**The Destruction:**
- Village methodically destroyed, not battle
- Crater suggests massive impact or magical effect
- No bodies found (incinerated? removed? teleported?)
- Pattern suggests giant took time, was deliberate
- Signs others attempted to approach but turned back

**Environmental Phenomena:**
- **Temporal Distortions:** Time flows irregularly in zones
- **Feywild Bleed:** Pockets of fey energy, upward-falling leaves
- **Reality Warps:** Visual distortions, impossible geometry
- **Ecosystem Impact:** Local creatures altered or fled

**Character-Specific Clues:**
- **Manny:** Recognizes craftsmanship beyond normal giant work
- **Nikki:** Arcane signatures feel strangely familiar
- **Rakash:** Instinctively understands giant's purposeful emotional state
- **Kyle:** Rainbow nature resonates uncomfortably with planar bleeding
- **Josh:** Markings react - glowing, tingling, or warming

**Zhaask Symbols:**
- Visible to anyone who approaches carefully
- Draconic language (PCs with language can partially translate)
- Possible meanings: location coordinates, warning, prophecy, names
- Full translation requires expertise or research

### First Encounter (Choose One)

**Option 1: Temporal Wisps**
- Creatures drawn to temporal distortions
- Adapted from shadow/air elemental stat blocks
- Phasing abilities, temporal displacement attacks
- 2-3 wisps appropriate for level 2 party
- Non-evil, but dangerous and territorial

**Option 2: Warped Ecosystem Creatures**
- Local animals mutated by planar bleed
- Wolves, bears, or predatory birds with aberrant traits
- Displaced features (extra eyes, wrong-colored fur, temporal echoes)
- 2-4 creatures with slight CR adjustments
- Emphasizes environmental danger

**Option 3: Rival Seekers**
- Another group investigating the axe
- Could be Merit Council agents, Chaos cultists, opportunistic bandits, or academic researchers
- Potential for combat or negotiation
- Introduces faction complexity
- 3-5 humanoid opponents

**Encounter Goals:**
- Appropriate challenge for level 2 party
- Demonstrate reality-bleeding effects in combat
- Test party tactics and cooperation
- Can be resolved through combat, negotiation, or clever thinking

### Revelations & Clues

**What PCs Can Learn:**
- Giant deliberately positioned axe and left it
- Reality-bleeding is intentional effect, not accident
- Zhaask symbols suggest connection to dragons or giant lore
- Temporal patterns indicate ongoing ritual or process
- Others have attempted to approach but failed or retreated

**Personal Discoveries:**
Each PC receives unique insight connected to their character:
- **Manny:** Craftsmanship suggests ancient giant traditions, possible Codex connection
- **Nikki:** Arcane patterns similar to something in their past or training
- **Rakash:** Giant's emotional state was purposeful, not angry or fearful
- **Kyle:** Rainbow nature's uncomfortable resonance suggests planar familiarity
- **Josh:** Markings' reaction indicates connection to temporal/planar phenomena

**Campaign Hooks Established:**
- What is the giant's larger plan?
- Are there other sites like this?
- How does this connect to Steel Dragon, Codex, or faction conflicts?
- What do the Zhaask symbols actually say?
- Should the axe be moved, studied, contained, or left alone?

### Decision Point: What Now?

**Immediate Choices:**
1. **Attempt Retrieval:** Try to move or claim the axe (difficult at level 2)
2. **Document Everything:** Copy symbols, record phenomena, report to patron
3. **Follow Giant's Trail:** Track where the storm giant went
4. **Secure the Area:** Attempt containment to prevent others from approaching
5. **Investigate Further:** Search for more clues before deciding

**Party Discussion:**
- What to report to the patron?
- Should they reveal everything they learned?
- What are the personal implications (Josh's markings, Kyle's reaction, etc.)?
- Do their individual missions (Manny and Nikki's Codex search) relate?

**Session Ending:**
- Close with party's decision about immediate next steps
