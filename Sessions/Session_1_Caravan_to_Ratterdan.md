# Session 1: Ratterdan Ruins Investigation

## Session Overview
The party (level 1) arrives at the ruins of Ratterdan to investigate reports of a storm giant's attack. They discover the buried Animated Heartstone artifact, which grants them bonus feats when touched. They also find the giant's massive axe - too large and cursed to claim yet - and face 1-2 minor encounters while exploring the ruins.

**Session Type:** Light combat, exploration, mystery setup
**Expected Duration:** 2-3 hours
**Party Level:** 1 (5 PCs with food buffs)

## Key Objectives
- Investigate Ratterdan ruins and discover what happened
- Find and interact with the Animated Heartstone (feat grant)
- Locate the giant's axe and understand why it was left
- Survive 1-2 minor encounters in the ruins
- Establish the larger mystery (who orchestrated this?)

## Session Structure

### Opening: Arrival at Ratterdan (5-10 minutes)
**Starting Point:** Party arrives at the ruins after hearing reports of the destruction

**What They Know:**
- Storm giant attacked and destroyed the village
- Giant left a massive axe at the site
- Strange phenomena reported (reality distortions, upward-falling leaves)
- No survivors found

**Initial Impression:**
- Smoking crater where village once stood
- Destroyed buildings scattered around periphery
- Massive axe embedded at center, sized for a storm giant
- Reality visibly warping around the artifact
- Unnatural quiet - ecosystem disrupted
- Sense of wrongness in the air

### Investigation Phase: Exploring the Ruins (30-45 minutes)
**Goal:** Let party explore freely and discover the two key artifacts

**The Giant's Axe (Cannot claim yet):**
- Sized for storm giant, bluish-silver metal
- Embedded at center of crater
- **Corruption seed visible** - dark energy pulsing through it
- Reality "bleeding" around it - temporal distortions
- **Cannot be moved:** Too heavy for level 1 party, cursed weight
- Touching it causes psychic damage (don't recommend it)
- Zhaask (Draconic) symbols etched near base

**The Heartstone (Buried, must be found):**
- Buried beneath rubble in the ruins
- **Finding it:** Perception DC 12 or Investigation DC 10 while exploring
- Fey energy signature if party has magical detection
- Purple crystalline heart-shaped stone, faintly pulsing
- Size of a human fist, warm to the touch

**The Destruction Pattern:**
- Village methodically destroyed, not a chaotic battle
- Crater suggests massive lightning strike or storm magic
- No bodies found (incinerated completely)
- Giant deliberately positioned axe and left
- Giant tracks lead away purposefully (not fleeing)

**Environmental Hazards:**
- **Reality Warps:** Difficult terrain in zones near axe (DEX save DC 10)
- **Feywild Bleed:** Upward-falling leaves, time feels strange
- **Temporal Distortions:** Small pockets where time flows oddly
- Party can navigate safely with care

### The Heartstone Awakening (15-20 minutes)
**Trigger:** When party finds and touches the Heartstone

**The Feat Ceremony:**
1. **Purple light explodes** from the Heartstone when first touched
2. **Each PC sees a vision** of their deepest desire/potential
3. **Feat manifests** - they gain the bonus feat immediately
4. **Light reclaims** - purple energy flows back into the stone
5. **Evil laugh echoes** - Heartstone is now sentient and awake
6. **Stone goes dormant** - for now

**Each PC's Vision (personalize):**
- **Manny:** Blade and magic becoming one
- **Nikki:** Shadow and arcane power merging
- **Rakash:** Primal fury perfected
- **Kyle:** Nature's rainbow spectrum expanding
- **Josh:** Mysterious markings glowing with purpose

**Important Notes:**
- Feats are permanent even if Heartstone is lost
- **IF HEARTSTONE IS DESTROYED:** Party loses feats permanently
- Party can choose to take the Heartstone with them or leave it
- The evil laugh hints at corruption/danger

### Minor Encounters (Choose 1-2)

**Encounter 1: Scavengers (Easy)**
- 2-3 bandits looting the ruins
- CR 1/8 each (Bandit stat block)
- Can be scared off or negotiated with
- Alternative: 3-4 giant rats drawn to death

**Encounter 2: Warped Creature (Medium)**
- Single dire wolf mutated by planar bleed
- CR 1 with minor aberrant traits
- Extra eyes, time-displaced movement
- Not evil, just territorial and confused

**Encounter Goals (Level 1 party):**
- Light combat, test basic tactics
- Show environmental effects in play
- Build party cohesion
- Quick resolution (10-15 minutes each)

### Session Wrap-Up & Mysteries (10-15 minutes)

**What the Party Learned:**
- Storm giant deliberately destroyed Ratterdan
- Giant positioned the axe and left it (why?)
- Heartstone was buried here (by whom? when?)
- Heartstone grants power but has sinister laugh (dangerous?)
- Axe is cursed/corrupted - cannot claim yet
- Zhaask symbols on axe (draconic, need translation)

**Questions Left Unanswered:**
- Who orchestrated this attack? (Octavia, unknown to party)
- Why did giant leave the axe here?
- What is the connection between axe and Heartstone?
- Will the giant return?
- What was Ratterdan hiding that someone wanted destroyed?

**Party Decisions:**
- Take Heartstone with them or leave it?
- Report findings to anyone?
- Return to claim axe when stronger?
- Follow giant's trail?

**Session End:** Party leaves Ratterdan with more questions than answers, but significantly more powerful (feats gained)
