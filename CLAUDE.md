- `PC_[Name].md` for players
- `NPC_[Name].md` for NPCs

### Notion Safety Protocol: üõ°Ô∏è CRITICAL

- Use `.config/safe_resync_all.sh` for manual re-syncing (UPDATE only)
- **ALWAYS test with new pages before attempting any Notion page modifications**
- For landing page setup: Follow `.config/NOTION_SETUP_GUIDE.md` (manual setup, no automation)

   - Decimate_Project_Subjects.md ‚Üí Create 8 individual NPC pages (not 1 summary)
   - Each location, NPC, PC, faction gets its own page

2. **Entity Relationships:**
   - Use Notion relations/mentions for connections
   - When referencing "Manny" ‚Üí Link to Manny's database entry
   - When referencing "Professor Zero" ‚Üí Link to Professor Zero's database entry
   - Build bidirectional relationships in database

3. **Content Separation:**
   - **Player Summary** ‚Üí Visible content block in Notion
   - **DM Notes** ‚Üí Hidden/toggle block in Notion or separate property
   - Never mix player-visible and DM-only information

4. **Database Views Required:**
   See `.config/NOTION_ARCHITECTURE.md` for 8 filtered views:
   - Session Hub, Active Goals Dashboard, Location Guide, NPC Directory
   - Faction Web, Party Tracker, Quest Threads, Artifacts & Mysteries

### Agent Configuration:
