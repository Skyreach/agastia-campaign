# Merit Council

## Player Summary

The governing body that believes in advancement and power based on demonstrated merit and achievement. They represent established authority and ordered society, standing in direct opposition to chaos and arbitrary rule. The Council enforces the Three-Generation Rule: noble families must prove merit within three generations or lose their status, which has created both a more dynamic society and the resentful Dispossessed faction.

## DM Notes

### Overview
The Merit Council is a meritocratic government that replaced hereditary aristocracy. While their ideals are noble, their strict standards have created unintended consequences, including the Dispossessed movement. They're currently fighting on multiple fronts: investigating Steel Dragon's murders, combating Chaos Cult infiltration, and trying to maintain system integrity against growing criticism.

### Philosophy & Core Systems

- **Three-Generation Rule:** Noble families have three generations to prove continued merit or lose status
