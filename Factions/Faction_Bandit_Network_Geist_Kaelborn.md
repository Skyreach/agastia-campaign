# Geist & Kaelborn's Bandit Network

## Player Summary

A criminal enterprise operating in and around Agastia, led by dwarf assassin Geist and elf sorcerer Kaelborn. Known for smuggling, kidnapping, extortion, and violent enforcement. They have a history of targeting unique individuals for profit - including kidnapping Kyle/Nameless at age 3 for their rainbow hair.

## DM Notes

### Overview
This is a straightforward criminal organization with magical muscle. Geist provides brutal enforcement and assassination capabilities, while Kaelborn supplies magical power and charismatic leadership. They operate through intimidation, violence, and strategic bribes to Merit Council officials who look the other way.

### Key Leaders

**Geist** - Dwarf Assassin
- Brutal enforcer and killer-for-hire
- Handles "wet work" and violent intimidation
- No moral compass, purely transactional
- Skilled infiltrator and ambush specialist

**Kaelborn** - Elf Sorcerer
- Charismatic leader and magical heavy
- Handles negotiations and high-value targets
- Uses magic for smuggling and combat
- More strategic than Geist, less impulsive

### Criminal Operations

**Primary Activities:**
- **Smuggling:** Magical contraband, stolen goods, illegal artifacts
- **Kidnapping:** Targets with unique traits (rainbow hair, magical bloodlines, etc.)
- **Extortion:** Protection rackets in Agastia's districts
- **Assassination:** Contract killing for hire
- **Fencing:** Moving stolen goods through legitimate fronts

**Revenue Sources:**
- Ransom payments from kidnappings
- Protection money from merchants
- Contract fees from assassinations
- Profit from smuggled contraband
- Bribes paid TO them by vulnerable businesses

### Goals & Progress Clocks

**Expand Territory** [2/6]
- Control more Agastia districts
- Muscle out competing criminal groups
- Establish monopoly on certain illegal goods
- Current Progress: Two districts under protection rackets

**Avoid Law Enforcement** [3/4]
- Maintain bribed officials
- Eliminate witnesses
- Stay below Merit Council's priority threshold
- Current Progress: Successfully operating but investigations increasing

### Network Structure

**Leadership:** Geist & Kaelborn (equal partners)

**Lieutenants:** 3-5 trusted criminals with specific roles
- Smuggling coordinator
- Fencing operation manager
- Kidnapping specialist
- Extortion crew boss

**Foot Soldiers:** ~20-30 thugs, bandits, hired muscle

**Contacts:**

- Fence networks in multiple cities
- Information brokers
- Safe house operators

### Relationships

**Enemies:**

### Kyle/Nameless History

**The Kidnapping (20+ years ago):**
- Targeted Kyle at age 3 for rainbow hair
- Held captive for ~20 years
- Purpose: Rainbow hair valuable for unknown reason (ritual? collector? rare component?)
- Kyle eventually escaped to Infinite Forest

**Current Status:**
- Believed Kyle dead or lost
- Intercepted message proves they're alive and operating near Agastia
- Do NOT know Kyle is hunting them
- May have other current captives

### Vulnerabilities

- Geist and Kaelborn are only truly powerful members
- Losing either leader would cripple organization
- Bribed officials can be flipped with evidence
- Former victims want revenge (potential allies for party)
- Operating in open means exposure risk

### Future Hooks

- Kyle's confrontation with Geist and Kaelborn
- Discovery of current kidnapping victims
- Corrupt officials turning on them
- Larger crime syndicate connection revealed
- Why was rainbow hair valuable? (plot thread)
- Other "unique trait" victims (magical bloodlines, marked individuals)

### Secrets

- Rainbow hair kidnapping was commissioned by someone else (client unknown)
- They have other "special" captives currently
- At least one Merit Council official is deeply compromised
- Planning major smuggling operation that will draw attention
- May have information about Brand's lost civilization (smuggled artifacts)

## Important Notes

**Criminal Enterprise, Not Scholars:**
- Geist and Kaelborn are BANDITS with magic, not academics
- They operate through violence and intimidation
- May have bribed officials, but they're not "inspectors" or "scholars"
- Their power comes from fear and illegal resources

**Kyle's Personal Quest:**
- This is Kyle's primary antagonist arc
- Confrontation should be emotionally charged
- Justice vs. revenge is key character choice
- Rainbow hair mystery ties to larger campaign lore

**Appropriate Level Threat:**
- Leaders are mid-tier threats (CR 5-6)
- Can be primary antagonists for levels 2-7
- NOT campaign-ending villains like Steel Dragon
- Network collapses when leaders defeated
