# [[Geist (Bandit Lieutenant)]] & [[Kaelborn (Bandit Boss)]]'s [[Bandit Network ([[Geist (Bandit Lieutenant)]] & Kaelborn)]]

## Player Summary

A criminal enterprise operating in and around [[Agastia]], led by dwarf assassin [[Geist (Bandit Lieutenant)]] and elf sorcerer [[Kaelborn (Bandit Boss)]]. Known for smuggling, kidnapping, extortion, and violent enforcement. They have a history of targeting unique individuals for profit - including kidnapping [[Kyle/Nameless]] at age 3 for their rainbow hair.

## DM Notes

### Overview
This is a straightforward criminal organization with magical muscle. [[Geist (Bandit Lieutenant)]] provides brutal enforcement and assassination capabilities, while [[Kaelborn (Bandit Boss)]] supplies magical power and charismatic leadership. They operate through intimidation, violence, and strategic bribes to [[Merit Council]] officials who look the other way.

### Key Leaders

**[[Geist (Bandit Lieutenant)]]** - Dwarf Assassin
- Brutal enforcer and killer-for-hire
- Handles "wet work" and violent intimidation
- No moral compass, purely transactional
- Skilled infiltrator and ambush specialist

**[[Kaelborn (Bandit Boss)]]** - Elf Sorcerer
- Charismatic leader and magical heavy
- Handles negotiations and high-value targets
- Uses magic for smuggling and combat
- More strategic than [[Geist (Bandit Lieutenant)]], less impulsive

### Criminal Operations

**Primary Activities:**
- **Smuggling:** Magical contraband, stolen goods, illegal artifacts
- **Kidnapping:** Targets with unique traits (rainbow hair, magical bloodlines, etc.)
- **Extortion:** Protection rackets in [[Agastia]]'s districts
- **Assassination:** Contract killing for hire
- **Fencing:** Moving stolen goods through legitimate fronts

**Revenue Sources:**
- Ransom payments from kidnappings
- Protection money from merchants
- Contract fees from assassinations
- Profit from smuggled contraband
- Bribes paid TO them by vulnerable businesses

### Goals & Progress Clocks

**Expand Territory** [2/6]
- Control more [[Agastia]] districts
- Muscle out competing criminal groups
- Establish monopoly on certain illegal goods
- Current Progress: Two districts under protection rackets

**Avoid Law Enforcement** [3/4]
- Maintain bribed officials
- Eliminate witnesses
- Stay below [[Merit Council]]'s priority threshold
- Current Progress: Successfully operating but investigations increasing

### Network Structure

**Lieutenants:** 3-5 trusted criminals with specific roles

- Losing either leader would cripple organization
- Bribed officials can be flipped with evidence
- Former victims want revenge (potential allies for party)

- Discovery of current kidnapping victims
- Corrupt officials turning on them
- Larger crime syndicate connection revealed
- Why was rainbow hair valuable? (plot thread)
- Other "unique trait" victims (magical bloodlines, marked individuals)

### Secrets

- Rainbow hair kidnapping was commissioned by someone else (client unknown)
- They have other "special" captives currently
- At least one [[Merit Council]] official is deeply compromised
- Planning major smuggling operation that will draw attention
- May have information about Brand's lost civilization (smuggled artifacts)

## Important Notes

**Criminal Enterprise, Not Scholars:**
- [[Geist (Bandit Lieutenant)]] and [[Kaelborn (Bandit Boss)]] are BANDITS with magic, not academics
- They operate through violence and intimidation
- May have bribed officials, but they're not "inspectors" or "scholars"
- Their power comes from fear and illegal resources

**Kyle's Personal Quest:**
- This is Kyle's primary antagonist arc
- Confrontation should be emotionally charged
- Justice vs. revenge is key character choice
- Rainbow hair mystery ties to larger campaign lore

**Appropriate Level Threat:**

- NOT campaign-ending villains like [[Steel Dragon]]
- Network collapses when leaders defeated
