# The Dispossessed

## Player Summary

Those who have been left behind by the Merit Council's system - particularly fallen nobles who lost their status under the Three-Generation Rule. A growing movement of the disenfranchised seeking change, though they disagree on whether that means reforming the system or destroying it entirely. Some seek peaceful inclusion, others plot revenge against the Council that stripped their families of power.

## DM Notes

### Overview
The Dispossessed are not a unified faction but a loose coalition bound by shared grievances against the Merit Council. The Three-Generation Rule, designed to prevent hereditary stagnation, has created a class of fallen nobles who remember their former status and resent its loss. Combined with others left behind by the meritocratic system, they represent a growing challenge to the Council's legitimacy.

### Composition
- **Fallen Nobles:** Families who couldn't prove merit within three generations (core demographic)
- **Failed Candidates:** Those who couldn't pass Merit Council testing
- **Former Officials:** Stripped of rank for incompetence or corruption
- **Generational Poor:** Families without resources for advancement
- **Ideological Opponents:** Those who reject meritocracy on principle
- **Refugees:** People displaced by various conflicts

### Goals & Progress Clocks

**Inclusion Reform** [0/8]
- Force Merit Council to relax standards
- Create alternative paths to recognition
- Address systemic barriers to advancement
- Gain political representation within system
- Current Progress: Movement organizing, no concrete gains yet

**Noble Support** [0/4]
- Build coalition between fallen nobles and other dispossessed
- Secure funding from sympathetic former aristocrats
- Establish leadership structure
- Create unified political platform
- Current Progress: Disparate groups beginning to communicate

### Internal Divisions
The Dispossessed are deeply fractured:

**Reformists:** Want to change the system from within
- Seek dialogue with moderate Council members
- Propose graduated standards or alternative tests
- Willing to work within existing framework

**Revolutionaries:** Seek to overthrow the Merit Council entirely
- Believe system is fundamentally unjust
- Plan direct action and civil disobedience
- Some consider violence justified

**Fallen Nobles (specific subset):** Former aristocrats with unique motivations
- Some seek restoration of hereditary privilege
- Others want revenge on specific Council members
- A few genuinely believe merit system failed them unfairly
- Most vulnerable to Chaos Cult recruitment

**Survivalists:** Focus only on immediate needs
- Mutual aid networks
- Underground economy
- Don't care about ideology, just getting by

### Nature of Movement
- **Growing:** Numbers increase as more fail Three-Generation evaluations
- **Divided:** Constant internal debates about methods
- **Vulnerable:** Chaos Cult actively recruiting extremists
- **Legitimate Grievances:** Merit Council policies do create real hardship
- **Dangerous Potential:** Could be force for reform or destruction

### Activities
- Peaceful protests and demonstrations
- Underground support networks
- Sabotage of Council operations (by extremist elements)
- Community organizing and mutual aid
- Smuggling and black market activities
- Secret meetings to coordinate strategy
- Propaganda campaigns against Merit Council

### Resources & Capabilities
- **Numbers:** Large and growing population
- **Local Knowledge:** Intimate understanding of communities
- **Desperation:** Motivation born from necessity
- **Limited Funding:** Small donations, some from fallen nobles with remaining wealth
- **Hidden Assets:** Former nobles sometimes retain secret resources

### Relationships
- **Primary Opposition:** Merit Council (though some seek dialogue)
- **Exploitation Target:** Chaos Cult actively recruiting extremists
- **Potential Allies:** Sympathetic merchants, progressive Council members
- **Internal Tensions:** Constant debates between reformists and revolutionaries

### Future Hooks
- Will reformists or revolutionaries gain control?
- What happens when Chaos Cult false flag operation is exposed?
- Can fallen nobles find common cause with other dispossessed?
- Will Merit Council offer meaningful reforms or just crack down?
- What if a Dispossessed leader emerges who can unify the factions?

### Secrets
- Several prominent Dispossessed leaders are already Chaos Cult plants
- Some fallen noble families have been stockpiling weapons
- Moderate reformists are in secret dialogue with Merit Council
- A few former aristocrats have enough hidden wealth to fund serious resistance
- The Three-Generation Rule was specifically designed to prevent the exact coalition that's now forming
