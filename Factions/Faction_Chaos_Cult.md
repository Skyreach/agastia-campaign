# Chaos Cult

## Player Summary

A dangerous cult dedicated to spreading chaos and disrupting the established order. Their influence extends throughout the region through infiltration of legitimate businesses and creating instability for profit. They appear to have connections to various criminal enterprises and are known to feed dragon corruption, making them a persistent threat to stability and civilization.

## DM Notes

### Overview
The Chaos Cult operates with a dual purpose: ideological chaos for its own sake (artistic escalation) and profit from the resulting instability. They've successfully infiltrated legitimate businesses, creating a network that both funds their operations and provides cover for their activities.

### Key Members
- **Brother Matthias** - Dragon handler, directly involved in feeding Steel Dragon's corruption
- **Veridian Ashworth** - Chaos profiteer leading mercenary operations, profits from instability
- **Aldara Brightcoin** - Unwitting enabler who provides emergency supplies, doesn't know she's helping the cult create the emergencies she responds to

### Goals & Progress Clocks

**Artistic Escalation** [1/6]
- Create increasingly dramatic and chaotic events
- Push boundaries of societal disruption
- Transform chaos into performance art
- Current Progress: Minor incidents have begun

**Chaos Profit** [0/4]
- Monopolize emergency supply markets
- Profit from instability they create
- Build financial empire on suffering
- Current Progress: Infrastructure in place, not yet activated

### Operations
- **Infiltration:** Legitimate business fronts provide cover and funding
- **Dragon Corruption:** Actively feeding Steel Dragon's descent into chaos
- **Instability Creation:** Orchestrate crises to sell emergency solutions
- **Emergency Supply Monopolies:** Control aid distribution through unwitting partners like Aldara
- **Mercenary Networks:** Veridian's forces available for hire while advancing cult goals

### Relationships
- **Enemies:** Merit Council, law enforcement, stability-seeking factions
- **Manipulation Targets:** The Dispossessed (recruiting extremists)
- **Unwitting Tools:** Merchants like Aldara, emergency responders
- **Corruption Victims:** Steel Dragon, other dragons in region

### Future Hooks
- What happens when Aldara discovers she's enabling the crises she responds to?
- How far will Brother Matthias go to corrupt Steel Dragon?
- What is Veridian's ultimate profit target?
- Are there other legitimate businesses the cult has infiltrated?
- What happens when their "artistic escalation" goes too far?

### Secrets
- The cult views chaos as art, not just destruction
- Profit motive keeps them organized despite chaotic philosophy
- They have a systematic approach to seemingly random chaos
- Multiple members don't know each other's cult affiliation
- Emergency supply monopoly is their most profitable scheme
