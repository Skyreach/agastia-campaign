# Storm Giant Warband (Octavia's Tool)

## Player Summary

A storm giant and their warband, operating as mercenaries-for-hire. Recently destroyed the goblin village of Ratterdan on contract. Known for devastating attacks and following orders without question. Rumors suggest they work for a powerful patron with arcane interests.

## DM Notes

### Overview
This is NOT an independent faction with complex motivations. The Storm Giant and their warband are a TOOL wielded by Octavia (Decimate Subject #8) on behalf of her warlock patron. Their agenda is simple: follow orders, acquire artifacts, eliminate obstacles.

### The Truth
- **Hired by Octavia:** Storm giant contracted to destroy Ratterdan
- **Motive:** Retrieve Heartstone buried beneath village
- **Patron's Goal:** Octavia's warlock entity wanted Heartstone awakened
- **Payment:** Unknown (arcane knowledge? Power? Future favors?)
- **Current Status:** Contract complete, but Heartstone taken by party

### Leadership

**The Storm Giant** (CR 13)
- Mercenary commander, not a schemer
- Follows contracts to the letter
- Honorable in a "deal is a deal" sense
- No personal grudge against Rakash or goblins
- Will complete job, then move on

**Simple Motivation:**
- Get paid
- Follow contract terms
- Acquire specified targets
- Destroy specified obstacles
- No complex ideology

### Warband Composition

**Core Members:**
- Storm Giant (leader, CR 13)
- 2-3 Cloud Giants (lieutenants, CR 9)
- 5-8 Ogres/Trolls (heavy muscle, CR 2-5)
- 10-15 Hobgoblins/Orcs (foot soldiers, CR 1/2-2)

**Specialized Roles:**
- Siege breaker (giant handles fortifications)
- Artifact retrieval specialists (trained to find magical items)
- Scouts (smaller members for reconnaissance)

### Current Contracts

**Completed:**
- Destroy Ratterdan ✓
- Retrieve Heartstone ✗ (party took it)

**Active:**
- Report back to Octavia about Heartstone location
- Possibly: Recover Heartstone from party
- Possibly: Other artifact retrieval jobs

**Pending:**
- Unknown future contracts from Octavia
- May be tasked with eliminating party

### Relationships

**Employer:**
- **Octavia:** Current contractor, warlock with unknown patron
- Relationship is professional, transactional
- No loyalty beyond payment

**Enemies:**
- **Rakash/Ian:** Sole survivor of Ratterdan, seeking revenge
- **Party:** Possess Heartstone Octavia wants
- Anyone who interferes with contracts

**Neutral:**
- **Merit Council:** Not hostile unless they interfere
- **Other Factions:** Warband is mercenary, not ideological

### Octavia's Warlock Patron

**Unknown Entity Wants:**
- Heartstone (fey artifact for power boost)
- Other artifacts related to awakening/animation magic
- Tests of Heartstone's capabilities

**Warband's Role:**
- Muscle for artifact acquisition
- Destruction when needed
- No questions asked about why

### Rakash Connection

**What Happened at Ratterdan:**
- Storm Giant hired to destroy village
- Zhaask (goblin traitor) provided intel
- Giant smashed Ratterdan, retrieved Heartstone
- Rakash survived, took giant's 8-foot axe
- Giant doesn't care about Rakash personally (just business)

**Rakash's Revenge Arc:**
- Giant is legitimate target for vengeance
- BUT giant was just following contract
- Real villain: Octavia (and her patron)
- Rakash won't know this initially

### Goals & Progress Clocks

**Retrieve Heartstone** [1/4]
- Locate party's current position
- Assess threat level
- Plan retrieval operation
- Execute recovery
- Current Progress: Knows party has it

**Complete Octavia's Contracts** [Ongoing]
- Follow orders from Octavia
- Report findings
- Accept payment
- Move to next job

### Vulnerabilities

- Warband is expensive to maintain (need contracts)
- Storm Giant is powerful but not invincible (CR 13)
- No ideological loyalty - could switch sides for better pay
- Simple tactics - overwhelming force, not clever strategy
- If Octavia stops paying, warband dissolves

### Future Hooks

- Rakash's confrontation with Storm Giant
- Discovery that Octavia hired them
- Warband pursuing party for Heartstone
- Possible negotiation (they're mercenaries, not fanatics)
- Learning about Octavia's warlock patron
- Giant's 8-foot axe mysteries (why does it have temporal magic?)

### Secrets

- Octavia hired them, party doesn't know yet
- Heartstone retrieval was the ONLY reason Ratterdan destroyed
- Zhaask betrayed Ratterdan for payment from Octavia
- Storm Giant doesn't know Octavia's full plan
- Giant's axe has temporal magic (was this expected? Side effect?)
- Warband may abandon contract if Octavia can't pay

## Important Notes

**Keep It Simple:**
- Storm Giant faction = muscle for hire
- No complex motivations or grand plans
- "Get artifact, smash obstacles, get paid"
- Octavia is the schemer, giant is the hammer

**Octavia's Tool:**
- Giant doesn't know Octavia's full plan
- Just following contract terms
- Would work for anyone who pays
- No ideological commitment

**Rakash's Arc:**
- Giant is legitimate revenge target
- But giant isn't the mastermind
- Killing giant is satisfying but doesn't solve root problem
- Octavia is the real enemy

**Appropriate Level Threat:**
- Storm Giant is CR 13 (deadly for low-level party)
- Lieutenants are appropriate mid-level threats
- Foot soldiers work for levels 2-4
- Full giant confrontation is level 6-7 milestone

**Mercenary Nature:**
- Can be negotiated with
- Money talks
- Not fanatics who fight to death
- Possible to turn against Octavia if she can't pay
