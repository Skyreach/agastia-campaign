# Decimate Project

## Player Summary

[Players know nothing about this faction yet. All information below is DM-only until revealed through play.]

## DM Notes

### Overview
The Decimate Project is a highly secretive program led by the mysterious Professor Zero, whose true identity remains unknown. The Project created ten subjects through memory manipulation and trained them as child soldiers for unknown purposes. Their current active goal is acquiring the Dominion Evolution Codex, but this appears to be only one step in a much larger, still-unrevealed plan.

### Leadership

**Primary Leader:**
- **Professor Zero:** Identity completely unknown
  - Architect of entire Project
  - Master of memory manipulation techniques
  - Goals extend beyond Codex acquisition
  - May not be working alone
  - Treats subjects as tools, not people

**Patrons (Strongest Subjects):**
- **Subject #8 - Octavia:** Drow Warlock, witch-like, most experienced field operative
- **Subject #9 - Nona:** Half-Elf Bard, protective guardian role, strategic coordinator
- **Subject #10 - Decum:** High Elf Wizard, eldest subject, keeps to himself, most missions for Zero

*Note: These three subjects are the most powerful and capable, giving them patron-level influence within the Project's operations. Lower numbers = newer/weaker subjects.*

**Weakest Subjects (Newest Recruits):**
- **Subject #1 - Monomi "Manny":** Half-Orc Eldritch Knight, newest recruit (PC)
- **Subject #2 - Biago "Nikki":** Tiefling Arcane Trickster, second newest (PC)

### Members - The Ten Subjects
All subjects detailed in `/mnt/c/dnd/NPCs/Faction_NPCs/Decimate_Project_Subjects.md`:
1. Subject details vary
2. All underwent memory manipulation
3. All trained as child soldiers
4. Varying levels of loyalty/awareness
5. Some may be player characters
6. Each has unique skills/specializations
7. Not all know they're part of Project
8. Some may have broken free
9. Others still under Professor Zero's control
10. Relationships between subjects vary

### Goals & Progress

**Acquire Dominion Evolution Codex** [In Progress]
- Active retrieval operation underway
- Multiple subjects possibly deployed
- Codex location and nature still being researched
- Opposition from other factions likely
- Not the final goal, just a stepping stone

**Unknown Larger Purpose** [???]
- Codex acquisition serves bigger plan
- True objective known only to Professor Zero
- May involve:
  - Mass transformation
  - Power consolidation
  - Reality manipulation
  - Army creation
  - Something even more dangerous
- Timeline unclear
- Scale of ambition: potentially catastrophic

### Operations & Methods
- **Memory Manipulation:** Core technique, used on all subjects
  - Erase inconvenient memories
  - Implant false backgrounds
  - Condition loyalty and obedience
  - May be reversible under certain circumstances
  - Leaves subtle traces detectable by experts

- **Child Soldier Training:** Systematic and brutal
  - Started at young age
  - Combined combat and specialized skills
  - Psychological conditioning
  - Created effective but damaged individuals

- **Artifact Retrieval:** Current operational focus
  - Codex is primary target
  - Likely other artifacts as well
  - Suggests magical/arcane end goal
  - Requires coordination of multiple subjects

- **Secrecy Maintenance:** Extreme operational security
  - Subjects don't know full picture
  - Professor Zero's identity hidden
  - No fixed base of operations (presumably)
  - Eliminate witnesses when necessary
  - Use subjects' modified memories as cover stories

### Resources & Capabilities
- **Knowledge:** Advanced understanding of memory magic
- **Assets:** Ten highly trained operatives
- **Intelligence:** Enough to locate rare artifacts
- **Funding:** Source unknown but sufficient
- **Connections:** Must have some to gather intelligence
- **Facilities:** Somewhere to train subjects (location unknown)

### Vulnerabilities
- **Subject Loyalty:** Not all subjects remain loyal
- **Memory Manipulation:** May be detectable or reversible
- **Small Numbers:** Only ten known operatives
- **Secrecy Dependency:** Exposure would bring multiple factions against them
- **Unknown Goals:** Even subjects don't know full plan, limiting initiative

### Relationships
- **Unknown to:** Most other factions (for now)
- **Potentially Opposed By:** Anyone who discovers their existence
- **Possible Connections:** Could secretly relate to any major faction
- **Subject Relations:** Complex - some subjects know each other, others don't

### Future Hooks
- PC discovers they are/were a subject
- PCs encounter subjects as allies/enemies not knowing connection
- Memory manipulation effects begin to break down
- Professor Zero's identity revealed
- Purpose of Codex becomes clear
- Other subjects seek to stop the Project
- True scope of larger plan emerges
- Competing factions learn of Project's existence

### Secrets (Tier 1 - Major Reveals)
- Professor Zero is not a single person but a title/role
- The Project predates all current conflicts by decades
- Memory manipulation affects more people than just the subjects
- Dominion Evolution Codex can be used on the subjects themselves
- At least one subject has regained memories and is working against Project

### Secrets (Tier 2 - Campaign-Defining Reveals)
- [To be determined based on campaign development]
- The Project's true purpose connects to [major campaign threat]
- Professor Zero's identity is [shocking reveal]
- The Codex will allow [catastrophic event]
- The real number of subjects is [not actually ten]

### Name Origin
"Decimate" - originally meaning to remove one in ten, suggesting:
- Selection of specific individuals (the ten subjects?)
- Systematic reduction of something
- Mathematical precision in approach
- Possible connection to destroying 10% of population/power/reality
- Or empowering the chosen ten?
