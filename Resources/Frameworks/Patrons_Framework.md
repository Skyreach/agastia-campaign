# Patrons Framework
*From "The Game Master's Book of Proactive Roleplaying"*

## Core Concept

Patrons are archetypal quest-givers: wealthy, powerful NPCs who enable PC adventures through resources and support. They represent factions and help PCs pursue goals in exchange for advancing patron's plans.

## Patrons vs. Allies

### Patrons
- Don't necessarily share party goals
- Help anyway in exchange for advancing their plans
- Provide resources for tackling challenges beyond PCs
- Higher social status than PCs
- Power dynamic not balanced
- Treat PCs as subordinates
- Probably patronize other adventurers
- Won't tolerate much disrespect/incompetence
- Can be guardrails for proactive goal-chasing

### Allies
- Share party goals
- Supporting characters in story
- Work together out of necessity/common purpose/ideology
- On common ground with PCs
- More balanced relationship

**Note:** Patrons can become allies over campaign through friendship, but resource restrictions don't disappear automatically.

## The Three Key Factors for Patron Design

### 1. What Resources Does the Patron's Faction Have?

**Resource Types:**
- Wealth (gold, treasury access)
- Information (spy networks, libraries, scouts)
- Technology (magic items, experimental gear, vehicles)
- Manpower (soldiers, workers, specialists)
- Influence (political connections, blackmail material)
- Facilities (safe houses, workshops, training grounds)
- Expertise (skilled NPCs, trainers, sages)

**Determines:**
- What PCs gain by working for patron
- Preferred goal-seeking style
- Head of assassins ≠ leader of merchant guild

### 2. How Powerful is the Patron's Faction Relative to Others?

**Determines:**
- Which challenges can they handle themselves?
- Which goals are beneath them?
- How much power are PCs getting access to?
- How difficult/dangerous are tasks patron requires?

**Critical Question:** "If faction is powerful, why don't they do the job themselves?"

**Answers:**
- Need deniability (PCs are unknowns)
- Too busy with larger concerns
- Lack specific expertise PCs have
- Testing PCs for greater responsibilities
- Internal politics prevent direct action
- Legal/moral constraints don't apply to PCs

### 3. What Are the Patron's General Personality Traits?

**Choose 2-3 Adjectives:**
- Greedy, Ambitious, Generous, Cautious, Reckless
- Honorable, Pragmatic, Idealistic, Cynical
- Charismatic, Stern, Jovial, Intimidating
- Paranoid, Trusting, Manipulative, Straightforward

**Used to:**
- Develop specific goals
- Determine how patron pursues those goals
- Guide negotiation style
- Inform reaction to PC success/failure

## Design Philosophy

**Patron = Expression/Personification of Faction**

1. Inherit resources and power from faction
2. Personality reflects faction ideology
3. **Design personality FIRST, then goals later** based on PC goals
4. Creates sandbox feeling vs. world-on-rails

## Long-Term Patron Goals

### Generation Method
1. Look at resources, power level, ideology
2. What would someone with this combination want?
3. Expand control/wealth/access?
4. Diminish rival's power?
5. Leverage resources for ideology?

### Patron Long-Term Goals Table (d10)

| D10 | GOAL |
|-----|------|
| 1 | Expand network of (wealth/information/prestige/military power) |
| 2 | Enforce claim on property/land (legitimate/illegitimate/questionable) |
| 3 | Uncover secret about rival through (subterfuge/diplomacy/bribery) |
| 4 | Get revenge on someone for (petty/serious/fake) reason |
| 5 | Provide (no-strings/many-strings) aid to ally in need |
| 6 | Gain ally through (military alliance/diplomacy/blackmail/trade) |
| 7 | Obtain item that (is lost/belongs to someone/hasn't been created yet) |
| 8 | Complete magical (ritual/spell/sacrifice) to (empower self/aid someone) |
| 9 | Claim position of power through (legal/illegal) means |
| 10 | Profit from (disaster/trade deal/secret exposed/war) |

**Important:** Generate long-term goals without players in mind. Generate mid/short-term goals when party needs help - custom-designed for situation.

## Short-Term Patron Goals

### When to Generate
- Party wants to pursue out-of-reach goal
- Party could use additional help/firepower
- Party would benefit from patron's resources
- Patron can make progress toward long-term goal in exchange

### Key Principle
**Patron who wants exactly what party wants = boring power boost**

Drama comes from opposing or not-quite-aligning goals.

### Method
1. Take PC's short-term goal
2. Create simple variation that serves patron's plans better
3. Can be simple exchange (share of loot) or longer relationship beginning

### The Two Dials

Tune these in tandem for negotiations:

**Dial 1: Aid Patron Willing to Give**
```
None ←→ Minimal ←→ Substantial ←→ Full Resources
```

**Dial 2: Restrictions Imposed**
```
None ←→ Minor ←→ Significant ←→ Full Compliance
```

**Balance:** Greater resources = Greater adherence to patron ideology/goals

## Patron Negotiation Framework

See `../Tables/Patron_Negotiation_Table.md` for full PC Goal → Patron Goal conversions.

**Basic Structure:**
1. PC states their short-term goal
2. Patron offers related goal that also serves their agenda
3. Negotiate what patron provides vs. what patron requires
4. Both adjust dials until agreement reached

**Example:**
- **PC Goal:** Obtain magic sword from dragon's hoard
- **Patron Goal:** Retrieve specific family heirloom also in hoard
- **Patron Offers:** Maps, dragon-slaying equipment, healing potions
- **Patron Requires:** Heirloom delivered intact, proof of dragon's death, public credit

## Patron Relationship Progression

### Initial Contact
- Patron approaches PCs or vice versa
- Single transaction, testing the waters
- Minimal investment from both sides

### Ongoing Relationship
- Multiple jobs completed successfully
- Patron provides better resources
- Patron shares more sensitive information
- PCs get preferential treatment

### Trusted Agents
- PCs proven reliable over time
- Access to faction's best resources
- Involved in patron's most important plans
- May be offered permanent positions

### Betrayal / Breakdown
- PCs fail critical mission
- PCs cross moral line patron won't accept
- PCs caught working for rival
- Patron becomes antagonist

## Examples from the Books

### Constable Harburk (Princes of the Apocalypse)

**Faction:** Town Watch of Red Larch
**Resources:** Manpower, food, local authority
**Power:** Weaker than town council, stronger than anyone else
**Personality:** Shrewd, kind-hearted, blunt
**Long-term Goal:** "Restore safety of Red Larch to when I was a boy"

**Approach:**
- Reactive to player adventures
- Facilitated goals they wanted anyway
- Became resource whenever players wanted to benefit town safety

**Negotiations:**
- Offered provisions and militia aid to go after bandits
- **Condition:** Bring bandit leader alive for trial
- Later: Investigate quarry attacks, bring perpetrators unharmed for trial

### Mr. Krahal (Blades in the Dark - Villainous Patron)

**Faction:** Demon-controlled cult
**Resources:** Impressive cult resources, supernatural knowledge
**Power:** More powerful than many fringe religious groups
**Personality:** Ancient, patient, manipulative
**Long-term Goal:** Resurrect corpse of sea demon under city (unknown to players)

**Approach:**
- Always reactive to PC actions
- Players released him → helped in return
- Players aligned goals → helped
- Players needed money → supplied

**Negotiations:**
- Sent weapons, money, gifts
- Asked only for small bits of information
- After second helpful interaction, players came to him
- **Deal:** Exact information supernaturally obtained in exchange for stealing codex

**Outcome:**
- Players' actions led to his success (released master from chains)
- Very powerful, high-level patron with contrary goals (to PC survival)
- Small favors = working toward his short-term goals
- Players never aware of long-term goal
- World changed in response to their actions, not in good way

## Patron Red Flags (When to Reconsider Design)

- [ ] Patron wants exactly what PCs want (no conflict = boring)
- [ ] Patron has no clear faction affiliation (where do resources come from?)
- [ ] Patron's personality contradicts faction ideology (breaks immersion)
- [ ] Patron can obviously do task themselves (why hire PCs?)
- [ ] No clear aid/restriction balance (what's the negotiation?)
- [ ] Patron never responds to PC success/failure (feels like quest dispenser)
