# Three Clue Rule Framework
*From "So You Want to Be a Game Master"*

## Core Concept

Mystery scenarios are structured as scenes (or nodes) connected by clues, not rooms connected by corridors.

**The Fatal Flaw of Linear Mysteries:** Each clue is a chokepoint. Miss one clue → scenario breaks.

**The Solution:** The Three Clue Rule

## The Three Clue Rule

> **"For any conclusion you want the PCs to make, include at least three clues."**

## Why Three?

- PCs probably **miss** the first clue
- **Ignore** the second
- **Misinterpret** the third
- But somehow **synthesize all** in incredible leap of logic
- Get exactly where they're supposed to go

**(Only slightly joking)**

### Think of It As:
- Each clue = one plan
- Three clues = one plan + two backup plans
- **All about redundancy**

### Best Case: PCs Find All Three
- Nothing wrong with this!
- Use additional clues to confirm/reinforce
- Positive feedback feels great ("I knew Lord Denton was fishy!")
- Makes scenario robust

### Preventing Misinterpretation
**Example:**
- Clue: Coat check receipt signed "Lord Denton"
- PCs convince themselves to stake out Hotel du Chat Noir (wrong)
- Additional clues push off erroneous conclusions, back on track
- "Letters mention Lord Denton. Wasn't that name on coat check?"

### Worst Case: Miss Two Clues
- Still have one clue to keep mystery moving forward
- Scenario doesn't break

## NO EXCEPTIONS Corollary

### "But this clue is really obvious!"

**Response:**
1. You're probably wrong
   - You already know the solution
   - Almost impossible to judge if "obvious"
   - Like answering riddle you know answer to

2. Even if right... so what?
   - Extra clues confirming "obvious" solution cause no problems
   - Why not safe rather than sorry?

### Why Not More Than Three?

- Nothing wrong with more (five, eight, twenty)
- **Three = sweet spot:**
  - Enough redundancy PCs almost never miss all
  - Enough complexity to:
    - Combine information
    - Confirm hypotheses
    - Enjoy positive reinforcement
    - Feel tight and satisfying

## Leads vs. Evidence

### LEADS (Procedural Clues)
- Tell where to go to find more clues
- Move PCs from scene to scene
- **Every scene needs three leads** to other scenes

**Example:**
- Claudette's identification papers include address
- Search her rooms
- Find burnt letters mentioning Lord Denton
- Now have lead to Lord Denton

### EVIDENCE (Deductive Clues)
- Help understand what's happening
- Reveal truth (who murderer is, what's really going on)
- **Can spread across multiple scenes**
- Might be entire scenes with no such clues (especially early)

**Example:**
- Claudette's body drained of blood → Vampire responsible
- Letters mention large bat outside window at night
- Letters mention malevolent red eyes burning into soul

## Inverting the Three Clue Rule

### Traditional Statement:
"For any conclusion, include at least three clues."

### Inverted for Node-Based Design:
"For any conclusion, include one clue in at least three different locations."

**Example:**
- Node A has clue pointing to Node C
- Node B has clue pointing to Node C
- Node D has clue pointing to Node C

**Benefits:**
- PCs can approach from Node A, B, or D
- Each provides clue to Node C
- PCs only need reach ONE of Nodes A, B, or D to continue
- **Three Clue Rule redundancy maintained**

## Node-Based Adventures

### Structure

**Traditional Mystery Chain:**
```
Hook → Scene A → Scene B → Scene C → Scene D → Ending
```

**Node-Based (Same Content, Non-Linear):**
```
       ↗ Scene A ↘
Hook →             → Scene D → Ending
       → Scene B ↗     ↑
       ↘ Scene C -----↗
```

**Flexibility:**
- PCs can visit in any order: C → B → A → D
- Or skip some: A → D (bypassing B and C)
- **Node-Based = Xandering for Mystery Scenarios**

### Node Types

**LOCATIONS:**
- Physical places to investigate
- Examples: Mansion, docks, library, crime scene

**PEOPLE:**
- NPCs to interview, interrogate, observe
- Examples: Suspects, witnesses, informants, rivals

**ORGANIZATIONS:**
- Factions with information/involvement
- Examples: Guilds, cults, governments, corporations

**EVENTS:**
- Scheduled occurrences to witness/participate in
- Examples: Auctions, galas, rituals, meetings

**ACTIVITIES:**
- Things PCs can do to gather info
- Examples: Stakeouts, research, forensics, divination

## Making Clues

### Broad Categories
- Physical Artifacts
- Glyphs/Data
- Biosignatures
- Interrogation
- Surveillance

### Specific Examples
- Correspondence (letters, email)
- Diaries and journals
- Ephemera from locations (matchbooks, posters, tickets)
- Official reports
- Tracks (to follow)
- Tailing someone
- Business cards
- Fingerprints / DNA / Blood type
- Graffiti
- Financial records
- Tattoos
- Canvassing neighborhoods
- Video/audio recordings
- Mystic visions/strange dreams
- Shipping information (tracking, postmarks, return addresses)
- Books (inscriptions, bookmarks, marginalia)
- Bureaucratic records/background checks

See `../Tables/Clue_Categories_Reference.md` for complete list.

### Ensure Wide Variety

**Reason 1: Engagement**
- Same thing over and over = less interesting
- Lots of different things = better
- Puzzle not puzzling if solution always same

**Reason 2: Structural Importance - Avoid Monoclonal Clues**

**Monoclonal Agriculture Analogy:**
- All bananas are clones
- All susceptible to same pests
- Single disease wipes all out

**Monoclonal Clues:**
- All fundamentally similar
- Players must do that specific thing
- Don't think to do it → miss ALL clues
- Three Clue Rule provides only superficial redundancy

**Example - Monoclonal:**
```
Figure out Tony hiding at Silver Rodeo:
- Ask Tony's girlfriend Susan
- Ask Tony's partner Silvester
- Ask Tony's mother Sara

Three different clues BUT...
If players don't ask people in Tony's life (for any reason),
one failure wipes all clues.
```

**Fix:** Group together for Three Clue Rule purposes
- List as "Question Susan, Silvester, or Sara" = ONE clue
- Need two OTHER clue types for redundancy

### Work from Skill List

**Method:**
1. Pick any skill from your RPG
2. How could PCs use that to get this info?

**Example - Point PCs to Cai Lijuan:**
- **Cryptography:** Cai's diary in personal code in bedside drawer
- **Locksmith:** Safe hidden behind picture with Cai's ID documents
- **Photography:** USB stick with photos, check EXIF data for Cai's location
- **Streetwise:** Informant knows Cai rented cabin on lake
- **Research:** Property records show Cai owns cabin

### Work from Conclusion

**Flip the Question:**
- Don't ask: "What clues would they find here?"
- Don't ask: "What clues would bad guys leave?"
- **Ask: "What does current scene need to tell PCs?"**

**Example - Cabin on Lake:**
- Too broad: "What clues in cabin?"
- More actionable: "Need clue pointing PCs to Cai Lijuan"

**Solutions:**
- Crumpled envelope in wastebasket addressed to Cai
- Property owner identifies Cai as renter
- Cold pizza box in fridge, Cai's name on delivery label
- Family in next cabin met Cai, knows name
- Cai's car still parked, run license plate/VIN

## Fallacy of Perfect Crime

**Objection:** "Why would conspiracy let PCs find note? Why wouldn't they destroy it?!"

**Answers:**
- Carelessness or bad luck
- Holding for leverage over fellow conspirators
- Planning to destroy, just haven't yet
- Need info for job, hold until job done
- Sentimental attachment (written by dead wife)
- Interrupted before could destroy
- Didn't realize it was incriminating

**Logic Extends Beyond Notes:**

**Fingerprints:**
- "Wouldn't murderer wear gloves or wipe prints?"
- Maybe did, missed partial print
- Maybe dumb or panicked
- Maybe wanted to but got interrupted

**Camera Footage:**
- "Wouldn't they disable cameras?"
- Didn't spot all cameras
- Did hack, deleted footage, but left traceable hack traces
- Only disabled SOME cameras

**Perfect Crime Reality:**
- Would have flawless operational security
- Would leave no evidence
- **Not how reality works**
- **Doesn't make great scenario**

**Do Opposite:**
- Thinking about crime, can't find clue giving needed info?
- **What extra mistake did criminal make allowing this info?**

## Permissive Clue-Finding

**Maxim:** More clues always better

### Natural Impulse to Resist
- Mystery defined by lack of information (wrong!)
- "If clue wasn't planned, PCs shouldn't have it! Would ruin mystery!"
- Subconscious bias toward hiding info

### Reality
**Mysteries defined by acquisition of knowledge, not lack**

### Need to Do Opposite
- Consciously choose permissive clue-finding
- Focus on knowledge acquisition
- **Default to yes**

### The Difference
There's a difference between:
- Lots of clues pointing to truth
- Murderer writing home address in blood on wall

### Whenever You Hold Back
- Closing off path to potential success
- Unless good reason to block, keep path open
- Players go looking → find something useful
- Unless method completely unrelated

### Think Differently
- **List of clues from prep = safety net**
- NOT straitjacket
- Players surprise you with better solutions? Great!
- Predesigned solution = worst-case scenario
- Safety net when players fail to create more interesting approach

## Proactive Clues

### When Needed
Despite best efforts, players work into dead end:
- Don't know what clues mean
- Ignoring clues
- Used clues to reach incorrect conclusion
- Not even aware mystery exists

### Raymond Chandler's Advice
**"Have a guy with a gun walk through the door."**

### More Generally

**Option 1 - Bad Guy Takes Action:**
- Finds out being investigated
- Sends someone to: kill, bribe, dig up blackmail, kidnap loved ones
- Creates new scene to investigate

**Option 2 - Next Part of Plan:**
- Robs another bank
- Kills another victim
- **Effect:** Proactively creates new location/event for PCs to interact with

**Key Point:** Not just have something happen
- Give PCs new avenue for obtaining needed clue
- New crime scene to investigate
- Matchbook in thug's pocket → bar to investigate

### Worst Case - "Get Out of Jail Free" Card
Brings scenario to satisfactory close no matter how bollixed:

**Example vampire mystery:**
- Vampire shows up to kill PCs (thinks they're "getting too close")
- Usually less satisfactory than hunting down in lair
- Final backup when all other backups failed

## Red Herrings (Use with Extreme Caution)

**Classic Element:** All evidence points to X, but it's red herring! Real murderer is Y!

### Problem 1: Makes Hard Harder
- Getting players to make correct deductions already hard
- Red herring = clue to FALSE deduction
- Once players reach conclusion, they latch on
- Extremely difficult to convince them to let go and reassess

**How Red Herrings Work in Stories:**
- Need evidence that absolutely, incontrovertibly refutes it
- "Harold couldn't have murdered Judy; he was at bar when she was murdered!"
- Unfortunately, your "incontrovertible refutation" may hold as much water as your "really obvious clue"
- **If using red herring:** Include at least three clues refuting it!

### Problem 2: No Need to Prep
- Players almost certainly take care of it for you
- Fill adventure with nothing but clues pointing conclusively at real killer
- Virtually guarantee players suspicious of 3+ other people first
- Get attached to suspicions
- Weave complicated theories explaining how evidence fits wanted suspect
- Classic misinterpreted clue example (why Three Clue Rule important!)

## Running Mysteries

### Revelation List as Checklist

**During Play:**
- Track which clues PCs found
- Check off or cross out as grabbed
- Miss a clue: Circle or star (might circle back later, assume won't)

**See at Glance:**
- Conclusions where PCs in jeopardy (missed 2 of 3 clues)
- Keep close eye on third and final clue
- Make sure PCs find it

**Example:**
```
REVELATION: Dwarven Alchemy Lab location

Clues:
[X] Map fragment in goblin chief's pocket
[O] Overheard conversation between cultists (MISSED)
[!] Tracks leading northwest (CIRCLED - might find later)
[X] Inscription on stolen amulet

Status: SAFE - found 2 of 4 clues, can reach conclusion
```

### Listen to Players

**When to Check Off:**
- When PCs actually reached conclusion
- NOT as soon as discussed as possibility
- Only check off if concluded it's true

**When Too Many Clues Missed:**
- OR all clues found but players haven't figured out
- Time to think about new clues to work into adventure
- Proactive elements come in handy!
