# Scene Framing Framework
*From "So You Want to Be a Game Master"*

## Core Concept

Outside dungeons, not every moment is relevant/interesting/part of game. Need to skip boring bits and jump to interesting bits.

**Interesting bits (fights, negotiations) = scenes**
**Boring bits = empty time**

Scenes float like islands in sea of empty time, connected by intention.

## Empty Time

### Definition
Moments where characters aren't making meaningful choices:
- Choices that won't change outcome
- Choices players aren't interested in
- Or both

### Examples
- Weeks of physical therapy (outcome foregone)
- Days traveling through hyperspace (unless exploring inter-character drama)
- Route choice if all routes lead to same place
- Mundane daily activities

### Identifying Empty Time

**Look at Players' Current Intention:**
- Intention creates vector
- Ask: "Where's the next meaningful choice?"

**Example:** PCs want to go to Courvier Estate
- Is route choice significant?
  - Maybe ambush on Guildsman Road, not on Old Dragon Gorge Road (significant!)
  - More likely route doesn't matter: Almond St, Walnut St, Macadamia Way (not significant)
- Not meaningful → skip past

## Scene Transitions

### Sharp Cut
Jump directly from current scene to next scene.

**Example:**
```
PLAYER: Let's head to Courvier Estate in Nobles' District. I want to see what Lady Isabella says.
DM: Okay, we cut to all of you waiting in Lady Isabella's private study. Door slams open and she comes sweeping in. "What do you want? I'm very busy."
```

**Advantages:**
- Clean, punchy pacing
- Strong scene frames
- Gets to action quickly

---

### Abstract Time (Eliding Narration)
Summarize the journey without fully disengaging from players.

**Example:**
```
PLAYER: Let's head to Courvier Estate.
DM: Okay, you leave Hogshead Tavern and head up Guildsman Street into Nobles' District. After brief and somewhat rancorous exchange with doorman at Courvier Estate, you're ushered into Lady Isabella's private study. A few moments later, she comes sweeping in. "What do you want? I'm very busy."
```

**Advantages:**
- Easy to read table reaction
- Can drop back into scene if needed
- Players can speak up when necessary
- Provides atmospheric detail

---

### Blended Approach
Sharp cut to point closer to new scene, then eliding narration to set up.

**Example:**
```
PLAYER: Let's head to Courvier Estate.
DM: Okay, when you arrive at Courvier Estate, you have brief and somewhat rancorous exchange with doorman before being ushered into Lady Isabella's private study. A few moments later, she comes sweeping in. "What do you want? I'm very busy."
```

**Advantages:**
- Flexibility in setting given circumstances
- Players can course correct how characters enter
- "Wait! I don't want to knock. I want to sneak in and surprise Lady Isabella!"

## The Bang

### Definition
Explosive moment forcing PCs to start making meaningful choices.

### Purpose
- Propels scene into motion
- Defines agenda of scene
- Reveals agenda to players

### Examples
- Arrow embedding in wall next to PC's head
- Noblewoman barging through door demanding answers
- Torches of mob coming over hill
- Nazi knocking on door
- Letter with large black spot (death mark)

### Impact on Scene

**Design of bang affects how scene plays out:**

**Example: PCs encounter ogre**
- Ogre jumps out and snarls in face? (immediate combat)
- Approaching chamber, hearing crunching of bones? (tension, preparation)
- See goblin strung up, intestines hanging, THEN heavy footsteps behind them? (horror, trapped)

### Other Bang Examples
- "You return home, but wife isn't there. In bedchambers, large bloodstain on ground."
- "Riding through Blue Hills, sun sets, full moon rising. Distance: howl of wolves. Howls getting closer."
- "You rip open envelope. Single sheet of parchment. No words. Only single, large, black spot."

### Rule of Thumb
- **Quicker to bang = better**
- **Larger number of interesting choices in response = better**

### Not Always First Thing

**Often useful to establish scene before high gear:**

**Example: Letter with black spot**
- Could cut directly to PC ripping open letter
- More effective: Describe messenger arriving (or letter on bed/in pocket), THEN player announces opening
- Bangs land better with proper scene setting
- If players confused/getting bearings, can't understand full importance/impact

## Setting the Scene

### Philosophy
- Fill frame with elements (who, what, where, when)
- Provide toys for you and PCs to play with
- **More flexible = more useful = more potential**

**Don't Need Eight Plans:**
- Almost certainly shouldn't make plans
- Priority: Include stuff fun to play with
- Players = gaggle of creativity
- Let them spin boring stuff in unimaginable ways

### All-Important Maxim

> **"You may know where the scene begins, but you don't know where it ends."**

This is **liberation, not intimidation:**
- Not writing book or filming movie
- Unlike traditional author: know start, not journey end
- Just set pins up
- Players knock them down

### Location (When and Where)

**Range:** Claustrophobic to panoramic
- "Back room at Red Hand" (tight, intimate)
- "Racing down dusty slopes of Olympus Mons" (epic, vast)

**Same as Dungeon Room Description:**
- **Three of Five:** Include 3+ of 5 senses
- **Two Cool Details:** Irrelevant-but-cool elements
- **Three-by-Three:** 3 elements, 3 details each
- **Keep Pithy:** Players have limited attention

### Characters (Who)

**Three Categories:**

#### LEADS
- Major characters in scene
- Most affected by agenda
- Capable of greatest impact on agenda
- **PCs almost always leads**

**Only Exception:** PCs deliberately choosing not to participate
- Example: Eavesdropping on conversation
- But double-check: Isn't secondary agenda avoiding detection?
- Triple-check: Isn't really about "Will PCs stop Roberta from confessing love to Charles?"

**If NO PCs are leads → triple-check what you're doing**
- Reframe agenda to be about PCs

#### FEATURES
- Supporting cast
- Wield influence over leads
- Provide crucial information
- Important resources in conflict

#### EXTRAS
- Scene-dressing
- Part of atmosphere
- Can be taken hostage, appealed to for mob justice
- Think of as part of location vs active agents

### Given Circumstances

**All scene elements:**
- Relevant events leading to scene
- Continuity from previous events
- Historical context

**Extra Punch from History:**
- Confronting villain who killed beloved horse
- Climactic battle in burning house when own parents killed in fire
- Returning to childhood home now in ruins

## Ending Scenes

### Basic Principle
Leave scene by cutting to new scene.

**Trick:** Knowing when to cut away

### Facile Answer
Scene over when characters done making meaningful choices:
- Establish vector to next choice
- Frame next scene

### FINISHING THE AGENDA

**Trap:** Thinking it's ONLY way for scene to end
- Pressure to conclusively resolve every agenda
- Most interesting agendas develop over multiple scenes:
  - Will-they-won't-they romances
  - Conflicts can't resolve until other event occurs
- Staying in impasse = boredom
- Identify other cut moments

### THE SECOND LULL

**Scene Flow:** Back-and-forth, rise/fall of tension
- Scene kicks off fast and hard (leads push objectives)

**First Lull:** Things slow, uncertainty, coasting
- **DON'T CUT AWAY**
- Characters/players need moment to:
  - Reflect on what happened
  - Think about meaning
  - Figure out strategy adjustment

**Second Lull:** Things slow again
- **Cut away** OR introduce new bang for new scene

### ON THE EXIT

**All PCs leave = clear signal scene over**

**Single lead leaving signals drawing to close:**
- Often single lead leaving (PC or NPC) signals end approaching
- Others wrap up loose ends

**Second Exit Rule:**
- First lead exit = scene coming to end (others wrap up)
- Second lead leaves = agenda resolved OR interest waning
  - Time to cut

### SCENE TO SCENE
Loop closes:
- Identify next scene
- Shift to abstract time or cut hard to next bang

## Scene Agenda Types

### Investigation
- PCs gather information
- Clues point to next scene
- See `Three_Clue_Rule_Framework.md`

### Combat
- Physical conflict
- Tactical choices
- Ends when one side defeated, flees, or surrenders

### Negotiation
- Social conflict
- Persuasion, deception, intimidation
- Ends when agreement reached or breaks down

### Chase
- Pursuit or escape
- Time pressure, obstacles
- Ends when caught, escaped, or lost

### Exploration
- Discover new areas/information
- Sandbox play
- Ends when decide on next vector

### Downtime
- Between-adventure activities
- Character development
- Resource management

## Splitting the Party

### Managing Separate Groups

**Talking About Scenes:**
- Explicitly announce scene transitions
- "We're cutting to the group at the docks"
- "Meanwhile, back at the mansion..."

**Cut in Middle of Scenes:**
- Interleave parallel action
- Build tension through crosscutting
- "You hear the explosion. Cut to the other group..."

**Cliffhangers:**
- Dramatic scene breaks
- "The door bursts open. Guards pour in. Now, what's the other group doing?"

**Crossovers:**
- Reuniting split parties
- Natural conclusion to split
- Relief and celebration when reunited

### The Time Crunch
- Use urgency to reunite groups
- "You have 10 minutes before ritual completes"
- Both groups racing to same location

### Look for Crossovers
- Identify reunion opportunities
- Don't force parties to stay split
- Let natural convergence happen

### Balance Spotlight
- Equal attention to all groups
- Track time spent on each
- If one group just sitting around, check if should be in scene at all

### Continuous Communication
- Keep all players engaged
- "While they're sneaking, what's your plan?"
- "You hear distant combat. What do you do?"
