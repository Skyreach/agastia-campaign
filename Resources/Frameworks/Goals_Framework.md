# Goals Framework
*From "The Game Master's Book of Proactive Roleplaying"*

## Core Concept

Goals are player-created character objectives that drive the narrative, create dramatic tension, and give GMs clear direction for encounter design. Goals transform passive players into active story drivers.

## The Five Rules of Proactive Fun

### 1. Each Character Should Have Multiple Goals
- Ideally 3 goals total
- One long/mid-term goal
- One or two short-term goals supporting it
- Ensures variety and prevents single-minded pursuit

### 2. Goals Should Have Varying Time Frames

**Short-term:**
- Completable in a few sessions
- Achievable now with current resources
- Serves as means to an end

**Mid-term:**
- 6+ sessions to complete
- May require power/skills/information not yet possessed
- Character learns/changes through pursuit

**Long-term:**
- Campaign-defining
- Drives the overall story arc
- Full character arc from start to finish

### 3. Goals Must Be Achievable (Measurable)
- Must have clear success state
- GM should be able to imagine a clear encounter/reward indicating completion

**Bad Example:** "Become more powerful"
**Good Example:** "Win a duel against someone stronger than me"

### 4. Goals Must Have Consequences for Failure
- Failure should advance the plot differently, not just allow retry
- Penalties should be story-related, not just mechanical
- No repeatable goals (if you can just try again, it's a skill check, not a goal)
- Consequences should be clear but not necessarily predetermined

### 5. Goals Must Be Fun to Pursue
- Should have level-appropriate obstacles
- If you can't think of obstacles, the goal isn't fun yet
- Too easy or too hard = not fun

## Goal Creation Process

### Player Steps:
1. Think about character's backstory, abilities, traits - explain to group
2. Come up with long/mid-term goal
3. Rework if necessary until it meets all five criteria
4. Share with table and adjust for collaboration
5. Create 1-2 short-term goals contributing to long-term goal
6. Rework short-term goals if necessary
7. Share and adjust

### GM Steps:
1. Is this goal achievable? Fun? How could it fail forward?
2. Record each player's long-term goal
3. Check short-term goals for achievability/fun/failure consequences
4. Record short-term goals
5. Note if goals involve same places/people/objects (creates natural overlap)

## Goal Structure Template

**Format:** "My character wants to [OBJECTIVE] because of [REASON], but [COMPLICATION]"

See `Tables/Goal_Generation_Tables.md` for random generation options.

## Integration with Other Systems

### Goals → Encounters
- Combat objectives derived from goals (see Tables/Goal_Combat_Objectives.md)
- Challenge rooms designed around goal obstacles
- Reward rooms provide goal-relevant resources

### Goals → Factions
- Faction goals should overlap with PC goals
- Creates natural collision and drama
- See `Factions_Framework.md` for overlap tables

### Goals → Patrons
- Patrons help PCs pursue out-of-reach goals
- Patron short-term goals generated based on PC needs
- See `Patrons_Framework.md` for negotiation framework

## Tracking Goals

### Progress Clocks (from Blades in the Dark)
- Circle divided into 4, 6, 8+ segments based on difficulty
- Fill segments as time passes based on PC actions
- When full, goal is complete
- Not planned beforehand - interpret PCs' actions
- Maintains consistency and honesty

### Status Tracking
- **Active:** Currently pursuing
- **Paused:** On hold for other priorities
- **Completed:** Successfully achieved
- **Failed:** Consequences triggered, new goal emerges
- **Evolved:** Changed form based on campaign events

## Examples from the Books

### Case Study: "Free my hometown from orc rule"
- **Type:** Mid-term goal
- **Timeframe:** Levels 6-9
- **Process:** Required gathering allies first
- **Culmination:** Battle to reclaim town
- **Clear failure state:** Orc attacks continue, town suffers

### Case Study: "Break curse plaguing my family line"
- **Type:** Long-term goal with multiple avenues
- **GM Response:** Listened to player ideas and dangled hooks
- **Status:** Still ongoing - open-ended but achievable
- **Result:** Multiple short-term goals emerged organically

### Case Study: "Replace fleshy body with steel/chrome" (Blades in the Dark)
- **Type:** Long-term goal
- **Duration:** 8+ months of play
- **Generated:** Dozens of short/mid-term goals
- **Process:** Player experimented on himself, sought volatile materials
- **Consequences:** Nearly died twice - real stakes
- **Evolution:** After completion, new goal emerged: "usher in age of machine-men"

### Bad Example: "Become famous bard"
- **Problems:**
  - Too vague - what does "famous" mean?
  - No meaningful failure consequences
  - Didn't fit with other goals (dying world setting)
- **Fix:** Made specific: "Perform lost sacred hymnal songs for citizens"

## Goal Validation Checklist

Use this checklist before approving a goal:

- [ ] Does the character have 2-3 total goals?
- [ ] Are time frames varied (mix of short/mid/long)?
- [ ] Is there a clear, measurable success state?
- [ ] Can I imagine a specific encounter that would complete this?
- [ ] What happens if this fails? (Must be meaningful)
- [ ] Can the goal be "retried" without consequence? (If yes, FIX IT)
- [ ] What obstacles stand in the way? (If none, FIX IT)
- [ ] Are the obstacles level-appropriate?
- [ ] Does this overlap with any other PC/Faction/Patron goals?
- [ ] Is this fun for the player AND the table?

## Common Pitfalls

### Too Vague
- "Become powerful" → "Defeat the champion who killed my mentor"
- "Find love" → "Win the heart of the noble who saved my life"
- "Get rich" → "Acquire enough gold to rebuild my family's estate"

### No Failure State
- If goal can be attempted infinitely without consequence, it's a skill check
- Add time pressure, rival pursuing same goal, or permanent consequences

### Too Easy / Too Hard
- Easy: Completable in single session without obstacles → expand scope
- Hard: Requires levels/resources years away → break into mid-term goals

### No Connection to Campaign
- Goals should naturally create scenarios in the campaign world
- If goal requires entirely separate adventure, reconsider or work with GM

## GM Tools for Goal-Driven Play

### Proactive Hooks
When PC has goal, create hooks that:
- Offer progress toward goal
- Present obstacles related to goal
- Introduce rivals with opposing goals
- Provide resources needed for goal

### Failure Forward
When PC fails at goal-related challenge:
- Don't block progress entirely
- Introduce complication that changes approach
- Create new short-term goal to overcome failure
- Let consequences drive new story direction

### Goal Overlap
When multiple PCs (or PCs + Factions) have overlapping goals:
- Create scenarios where both can make progress
- OR create scenarios where goals conflict (drama!)
- Use overlap to tie party together narratively
- Faction goals provide natural antagonists
