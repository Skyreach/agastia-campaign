- Troubleshooting

## üîÑ System Integration

```
Goals ‚Üê‚Üí Factions
  - Faction goals overlap with PC goals
  - Creates natural collision

Factions ‚Üê‚Üí Patrons
  - Patrons represent factions
  - Inherit resources/power/ideology

Patrons ‚Üê‚Üí Goals
  - Patrons enable PC goals
  - Short-term goals generated on-demand

Factions ‚Üê‚Üí Dungeons
  - Faction rosters become adversary rosters
  - Territories map to dungeon zones

Goals ‚Üê‚Üí Mysteries
  - PC goals become mystery conclusions
  - Goal obstacles become clues

Scenes ‚Üê‚Üí ALL
  - Scene Flow orchestrates all systems
  - Determines which system active
```

## üìñ Usage Workflow

### Session Prep
1. Review PC goals (`list_goals`)
2. Check for goal overlaps (`find_goal_overlaps`)
3. Run faction conflict check (`run_faction_conflict`)
4. Update faction states based on conflicts
5. Prepare patron negotiations if PCs need help
6. Design encounters around goals/factions

### During Session
1. Track dungeon turns (if dungeoncrawling)
2. Use adversary rosters for dynamic response
3. Frame scenes with Bangs
4. Track clues found in mysteries
5. Update goal progress clocks
6. Note faction reactions to PC actions

### Between Sessions
1. Update goal statuses/progress
2. Run faction conflict checks
3. Restock dungeons
4. Update adversary rosters
5. Track patron relationships
6. Plan next session hooks from changes

## üé≤ Random Generation Quick Reference

**Generate a Goal:**
```
1. Roll d20 on Objectives table
2. Roll d20 on Reasons table
3. Roll d20 on Complications table
4. Combine: "wants to [OBJ] because [REASON], but [COMP]"
5. Add success criteria, failure consequences, obstacles
6. Validate with Five Rules
```

**Check for Faction Conflict:**
```
1. Roll 1d6 - on 1, conflict occurs
2. Roll twice on faction table (or choose specific factions)
3. Roll 1d8 on Conflict Outcomes table
4. Interpret narratively and update rosters
```

**Generate Patron Negotiation:**
```
1. Identify PC's short-term goal
2. Look up category in Negotiation Table
3. Find related patron goal
4. Set initial Aid and Restriction dials
5. Negotiate until agreement
```

**Run a Mystery:**
```
1. Create revelation list (conclusions PCs should reach)
2. For each revelation, create 3+ clues
3. Place clues in different nodes (locations/people/events)
4. Track clues found/missed/circled during session
5. If stuck, use proactive clues (guy with a gun)
```

## üîÆ Future Expansions

Potential additional MCPs:
- Dynamic Dungeon MCP (adversary rosters, restocking)
- Mystery & Investigation MCP (Three Clue Rule enforcement)
- Scene Flow MCP enhancements (Bang generation, lull detection)

These would complete the full automation suite for the frameworks.
