# Patron Negotiation Table
*From "The Game Master's Book of Proactive Roleplaying"*

## How to Use This Table

1. **PC states their short-term goal** (what they want to accomplish)
2. **Find similar PC goal** in left column (or closest match)
3. **Patron offers related goal** from middle column (also serves patron's agenda)
4. **Negotiate terms** using right column and Two Dials framework

## The Two Dials

Adjust these in tandem during negotiation:

**Aid Patron Provides:**
```
None ← → Minimal ← → Substantial ← → Full Resources
```

**Restrictions Patron Imposes:**
```
None ← → Minor ← → Significant ← → Full Compliance
```

**Balance:** Greater resources = Greater adherence to patron ideology/goals

- Restrictions: Don't embarrass patron, maintain deniability

- Typical: "No questions asked" + specialized resources
- Restrictions: Don't talk, don't fail, don't cross us

**Religious Patron:**
- Values ideology alignment, devotion, spreading faith
- Typical: "Serve the deity" + divine resources
- Restrictions: Follow tenets, convert others, tithe to temple

**Merchant Patron:**
- Values profit, trade opportunities, market access
- Typical: "Make me money" + financial/logistical resources
- Restrictions: Exclusive deals, percentage cuts, trade route control

**Arcane Patron:**
- Values knowledge, magical components, research
- Typical: "Bring me specimens" + magical resources
- Restrictions: Share all findings, don't damage subjects, exclusivity

### Adjusting the Dials

**High Aid, High Restriction:**
```
Patron: "I'll give you the full might of my army, my best equipment,
and unlimited funding. In return, you follow my orders exactly, report
everything, and publicly declare you work for me."
```

**Moderate Aid, Moderate Restriction:**
```
Patron: "I'll provide supplies, maps, and a guide. In return, I want
first pick of any treasure you find, and you mention my name when you
succeed."
```

**Low Aid, Low Restriction:**
```
Patron: "I'll give you some coin for expenses. Just bring me back
what you find, and we're square. What you do otherwise is your business."
```

**High Aid, Low Restriction (Rare):**
```
Patron: "Our goals align perfectly. Take everything you need from my
resources. I trust you to do what's right."
(Usually happens after long relationship of trust)
```

**Low Aid, High Restriction (Unfair):**
```
Patron: "I'll give you barely anything, but you'll do exactly as I say
and owe me everything you find. Take it or leave it."
(PCs should probably leave it, or patron is villain)
```

## Example Negotiations

### Example 1: Obtain Magic Sword

**PC Goal:** "We need a magic sword to fight the vampire lord."

**Patron Response (Noble):** "I have a family heirloom, a blessed silver longsword, perfect for vampire hunting. I'll loan it to you on these terms: You destroy the vampire, return the sword, and let me throw a ball celebrating your victory - where I'll take public credit for equipping you."

**Dials:** High Aid (perfect weapon), Moderate Restriction (return + public credit)

**Negotiation:** PCs might counter: "We'll return the sword and attend the ball, but we get to tell the real story. You can say you equipped us, that's true." Patron agrees.

---

### Example 2: Delve Into Ruins

**PC Goal:** "We want to explore the ancient ruins for treasure and glory."

**Patron Response (Merchant Guild):** "Those ruins are on land I'm negotiating to buy. I'll provide supplies, healing potions, and a 100 gold advance if you: Map the entire ruin, bring me any historical documents you find, and help me establish a trading post in the safest area."

**Dials:** Substantial Aid (supplies + gold + potions), Significant Restriction (mapping + documents + establishing post)

**Negotiation:** PCs might counter: "We'll map it and help with the trading post, but we keep any magic items we find, and the advance is 200 gold." Patron: "150 gold, you keep magic items but I get mundane treasure, and you spend a week helping establish the post." PCs accept.

---

### Example 3: Rescue Captive

**PC Goal:** "We need to rescue my sister from the cult."

**Patron Response (Temple):** "The cult has been a thorn in our side. I'll provide you with healing support, holy water, and blessings. In return: If you find their unholy texts, bring them to me for purification. Also, your sister should consider joining our temple after her ordeal - we offer protection."

**Dials:** Moderate Aid (healing support + items + blessings), Moderate Restriction (deliver texts + recruitment pitch)

**Negotiation:** PC: "We'll bring you the texts, and I'll tell my sister about the temple, but her choice is her own." Patron: "Fair enough. But if she joins, I expect you to do the same." PC: "If she joins and vouches for you, I'll consider it." Patron agrees.

---

### Example 4: Hunt Monster

**PC Goal:** "We need to kill the manticore terrorizing travelers."

**Patron Response (Arcane Academy):** "Fascinating creature! I've been wanting to study one. I'll provide you with potions of flying and antitoxin. In exchange: Bring me the beast alive, or at minimum, its intact body with venom sacs, wings, and brain preserved."

**Dials:** Moderate Aid (useful potions), High Restriction (bring alive or specific body parts preserved)

**Negotiation:** PCs: "Bringing it alive is insanely dangerous. We'll kill it and do our best to preserve what you want, but no guarantees in the heat of battle." Patron: "I'll throw in a Potion of Superior Healing and a tanglefoot bag to help capture it. If you bring it alive, I'll pay 500 gold bonus." PCs accept the challenge.

## Ongoing Relationship Progression

As PCs complete jobs for patron, relationship may evolve:

**1-2 Jobs:** Initial relationship, testing each other
- Moderate Aid, Moderate Restrictions
- Patron cautious, PCs uncertain

**3-5 Jobs:** Proven relationship, growing trust
- Substantial Aid, Moderate Restrictions
- Patron invests more, expects same reliability

**6-10 Jobs:** Trusted agents
- High Aid, Low-Moderate Restrictions
- Patron gives PCs more freedom, trusts judgment
- May offer permanent positions

**10+ Jobs:** Inner circle
- Full Resources, Low Restrictions
- Goals genuinely align
- May become true allies instead of patron/client

**Betrayal:** Trust lost
- Patron becomes antagonist
- Former aid becomes hindrance (knows PC methods)
- New complications from broken relationship

## Red Flags (Unfair Deals)

Watch for these warning signs of exploitative patrons:

- [ ] Patron demands everything, offers almost nothing (Low Aid, High Restriction)
- [ ] Patron lies about resources available
- [ ] Patron changes terms after PCs already invested
- [ ] Patron expects illegal/immoral acts without warning
- [ ] Patron threatens PCs if they don't accept
- [ ] Patron blames PCs for patron's failures
- [ ] Patron never acknowledges PC success
- [ ] Patron competes with PCs for same goals

**These patrons may be villains in disguise!**

## Quick Reference

**NEGOTIATION STEPS:**
1. PC states goal
2. Patron offers related goal
3. Patron sets initial aid level
4. Patron sets initial restriction level
5. PC counters (adjust dials)
6. Negotiate until both agree
