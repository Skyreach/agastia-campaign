## Clue Combination Techniques

### Triangulation
Combine three different clue types to reach conclusion:
- Witness (interrogation) + Blood type (biosignature) + Letter (glyph) = Suspect identified

### Redundancy
Same conclusion from multiple categories:
- Fingerprints (bio) + Camera footage (surveillance) + Witness (interrogation) = All point to same person

### Progressive Revelation
Clues build on each other:
- Map fragment (artifact) → Location identified (interrogation) → Stakeout (surveillance) → Confrontation

### Skill Diversity
Each clue requires different skill:
- Investigation to find letter
- History to date it
- Arcana to identify seal
- Insight to understand motive
- Survival to track sender

## Avoiding Monoclonal Clues

**Bad (Monoclonal):**
- Ask Susan about Tony
- Ask Silvester about Tony
- Ask Sara about Tony

All require same action (interrogate Tony's associates). One failure = all failures.

**Good (Diverse):**
- Ask Susan about Tony (interrogation)
- Find Tony's diary (artifact search)
- Track Tony's muddy footprints (survival)

Different approaches, different skills, different clue types.

## Quick Clue Generation

**When stuck, use this checklist:**

1. **What physical object could point to the conclusion?**
2. **What could be written/recorded about this?**
3. **What biological evidence would exist?**
4. **Who could have information about this?**
5. **What could be observed/surveilled?**

**Generate one clue from each category = 5 clues total**

Reduce to best 3 for Three Clue Rule, keep others as backups.
