# Faction Conflict Table
*From "The Game Master's Book of Proactive Roleplaying"*

## When to Use

**Between Sessions** to determine what factions have been up to while PCs were away.

**Procedure:**
1. **Faction conflict check:** Roll 1d6, on 1 = conflict occurred
2. **Identify factions:** Roll twice on your faction table (same result = civil strife within faction, or reroll)
3. **Determine outcome:** Roll 1d8 on table below
4. **Interpret result:** Translate to concrete changes (adversary roster updates, key changes, new hooks)

## Faction Conflict Outcomes (1d8)

| D8 | OUTCOME | EFFECT |
|----|---------|--------|
| 1 | **Stalemate Skirmish** | Both factions largely unaffected. May have reinforced defenses OR subtract 1-2 members from encounters/action groups. Ripe for alliances. Signs of conflict visible (new graves, damaged areas, increased patrols). |
| 2 | **Faction 1 Damaged** | Faction 1 loses ~25% strength. Eliminate some encounters/action groups OR subtract 1d4 members from each group. Faction 2 gains confidence and may press advantage. |
| 3 | **Faction 1 Crippled** | Faction 1 loses ~50% strength. Entire action groups lost. Consider modifying territory (lost ground) or leaving chunks undefended. Faction 2 in strong position. |
| 4 | **Faction 1 Destroyed** | Faction 1 eliminated entirely. Lair empty, occupied by Faction 2, or restocked randomly. Population killed, driven off, or enslaved. Power vacuum created. |
| 5 | **Both Factions Damaged** | Both factions lose ~25% strength. Mutual casualties. Neither can press advantage. Opportunity for third party (PCs!) to tip balance. |
| 6 | **Both Factions Crippled** | Both factions lose ~50% strength. Devastating conflict. Area may be contested wasteland. Other factions may move in. PCs could easily dominate both. |
| 7 | **Both Factions Destroyed** | Both factions eliminated. Area now empty or third faction moves in. Massive power vacuum. Huge opportunity for PCs or other factions. |
| 8 | **Factions Unite** | Factions allied (temporarily or permanently). Leader killed/subjugated, short-term goal aligned, or populations fully intermixed. Much stronger combined force. May now threaten PCs. |

**Note:** For results 2-4, determine which faction is affected randomly (flip coin) or choose based on power levels/narrative sense.

## Interpreting Results

### Don't Just Reduce Numbers
Each result should have **narrative significance** beyond stat reduction.

**Ask:**
- How did this happen?
- What sparked the conflict?
- What tactics did they use?
- Who were the heroes/villains?
- What unintended consequences occurred?
- How do survivors feel?
- What opportunities does this create?

### Propagating Changes

**Example: Both Factions Damaged**
- Don't just cross off 4 orcs and 3 goblins
- Tell a story:
  - "Orc raid on goblin warrens backfired"
  - "Goblins collapsed tunnel, killing raiders but burying own smithy"
  - "Orc shaman killed, goblins lost their wolf riders"
  - "Now both sides nursing wounds, blaming each other"

**Update Accordingly:**
- Adversary rosters (reduce specific groups)
- Dungeon key (collapsed tunnel in Area 14, wrecked smithy in Area 19)
- Faction attitudes (increased hostility, or exhausted/cautious)
- Territory (goblin tunnel now connects to orc level)
- New hooks (both sides seeking mercenaries = PCs!)

## Example Interpretations from the Books

### Example 1: Asmodean Hobgoblins + Court of Waves = Both Damaged

**Context:**
- Hobgoblins at war with sahuagin
- Sahuagin have water magic ward vs hobgoblin fire

**Interpretation:**
"Hobgoblins asked Court of Waves (water elementals) for help → they agreed to perform tidal wave ritual on sahuagin lakes. But ritual went awry → uncontrolled water elementals rampage through Courts AND slay hobgoblin leaders watching the ritual."

**Concrete Changes:**
- Leadership crisis on Level 5 (hobgoblin command structure broken)
- Blasted chaos on Level 7 (Court of Waves chambers destroyed)
- Rampaging water elementals added to random encounter table
- Both factions reduced by 25%
- Hobgoblin roster: Remove "Leadership Circle" action group
- Court roster: Remove "Ritual Chamber Guards" action group
- New room keys: Destroyed ritual chamber, bodies of hobgoblin leaders

---

### Example 2: Wandering Adventurers + Asmodean Hobgoblins = Both Destroyed

**First Interpretation:**
"Adventurers (hired by sahuagin as mercenaries) invade Level 5, wipe out disorganized hobgoblins. Surviving adventurers killed by rampaging water elemental still loose from previous conflict."

**Concrete Changes:**
- Level 5 now EMPTY (no hobgoblin roster)
- Adventurer corpses in throne room (loot opportunity!)
- Water elemental still rampaging (random encounter)

**Further Development:**
"Sahuagin wave-casters descend into abandoned hobgoblin warrens to pacify rogue elemental and claim the level for themselves."

**Even More Changes:**
- New faction: Sahuagin now on Level 5
- New adversary roster for sahuagin
- Sahuagin converting hobgoblin forges to underwater grottos
- PCs arriving find construction in progress

## Random Faction Table Construction

### Basic Structure

List all active factions, assign to die faces:

**Example (1d6):**
1. Town Watch
2. Merchant Guild
3. Cult of the Serpent
4. Thieves' Guild
5. Noble House Corvain
6. Temple of the Sun

**Example (1d8) with Options:**
1. Red Orc Tribe
2. Goblin Clans
3. Bone Necromancer Cult
4. Rival Adventurers
5-6. Outsider faction becomes interested (roll on Outsider table)
7-8. Roll again twice (multi-party conflict)

### Optional Additions

**WANDERING ADVENTURERS:**
- Competing adventuring groups
- Good wildcard option
- Can ally with PCs or compete

**OUTSIDERS:**
- External faction becomes interested
- New faction or established one from previous adventure
- Binds campaign together across adventures

**ROLL AGAIN TWICE:**
- Multi-party conflicts (3+ factions)
- More complex situations
- Higher chaos potential

## Faction Conflict Modifiers

### Power Level Adjustments

**If factions are NOT evenly matched:**

**Underdog faction takes damage:**
- Increase damage by one category
- Damaged → Crippled
- Crippled → Destroyed

**Dominant faction takes damage:**
- Reduce damage by one category
- Crippled → Damaged
- Damaged → Stalemate

**Example:**
- Roll: Faction 1 Damaged
- But Faction 1 is much weaker
- Adjust to: Faction 1 Crippled

### PC-Influenced Conflicts

**If PCs recently helped one faction:**
- That faction gains advantage
- Reduce damage they take by one category
- OR increase damage they inflict by one category

**Example:**
- PCs helped Town Watch arrest cultists
- Roll: Both Factions Damaged
- Adjust to: Cult Crippled, Watch Damaged (PC support tipped balance)

## Civil Strife (Same Faction Rolled Twice)

When you roll the same faction twice, it's in conflict with itself:

### Causes of Civil Strife

**Leadership Challenge:**
- Rival claims leadership
- Coup attempt
- Assassination of leader

**Ideological Split:**
- Faction divides over core beliefs
- Hardliners vs. moderates
- Different interpretation of goals

**Resource Conflict:**
- Fighting over territory/treasure/resources
- Different branches competing for same prize

**Betrayal:**
- Traitor in their midst
- Double agent revealed
- Sabotage from within

### Resolving Civil Strife

Use same outcomes table, but interpret as internal conflict:

**Stalemate:** Faction divided but both sides remain
**One Side Wins:** Losing side purged, fled, or absorbed
**Both Damaged:** Faction weakened overall, but still whole
**Destroyed:** Faction collapses entirely, fragments scatter
**Unite:** Conflict resolved, faction reunified (possibly stronger)

## Skipping the Roll

**Personal inspiration takes precedence!**

If you have cool idea for what happened between sessions:
- Use it!
- Table is fallback when inspiration doesn't strike
- Table can also spark inspiration (roll, then elaborate)

## Frequency Guidelines

### Standard Campaign
- Check once between each session
- 1 in 6 chance of conflict
- ~1 conflict every 6 sessions

### High-Intrigue Campaign
- Check once between each session
- 1 in 4 chance of conflict (roll 1d4, on 1)
- More frequent faction action

### Low-Intrigue / Dungeon-Focused
- Check once per in-game month
- 1 in 6 chance of conflict
- Factions matter but aren't focus

### Megadungeon with Multiple Factions
- Check after each expedition (long rest in dungeon)
- 1 in 6 chance
- Dynamic dungeon environment between delves

## Quick Reference

**BETWEEN SESSIONS:**
1. Roll 1d6, on 1 = conflict
2. Roll twice on faction table
3. Roll 1d8 on outcomes table
4. Interpret result narratively
5. Update rosters and keys
6. Create new hooks from changes

**DAMAGE GUIDELINES:**
- Stalemate: 0-10% casualties
- Damaged: 25% casualties
- Crippled: 50% casualties
- Destroyed: 100% casualties

**UNITED FACTIONS:**
- Combine rosters
- Share territory
- May have joint command or dominant leader
- Much stronger force (be careful!)
