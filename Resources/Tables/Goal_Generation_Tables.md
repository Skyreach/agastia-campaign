## Example Generated Goals

### Example 1: Roll 4, 10, 2
**"My character wants to slay a powerful monster because revenge for past injustice, but a rival is interested in the same thing."**

This could become:
- Long-term: "Hunt down and kill the dragon that destroyed my village"
- Complication: "A famous dragonslayer also seeks this dragon for the glory"
- Short-term goals: "Find the dragon's lair before the rival," "Discredit the rival's claim"

### Example 2: Roll 8, 3, 6
**"My character wants to find a missing family member because genuine concern for others' wellbeing, but I'm missing key information."**

This could become:
- Mid-term: "Locate my kidnapped sister"
- Complication: "I don't know who took her or where they went"
- Short-term goals: "Question witnesses," "Investigate the crime scene," "Find the cult that's been active in the area"

### Example 3: Roll 17, 8, 9
**"My character wants to break a curse or prophecy because spiritual enlightenment or divine calling, but there's a religious prohibition against it."**

This could become:
- Long-term: "Break the family curse that's plagued us for generations"
- Complication: "The local church says the curse is divine punishment"
- Short-term goals: "Find heretical texts about curse-breaking," "Seek audience with sympathetic priest," "Gather components for forbidden ritual"

## Customization Guidelines

### Making It Specific
The rolled result is a starting point. Make it specific to your character and campaign:

**Generic:** "Slay a powerful monster"
**Specific:** "Kill the Tarrasque that ate my mentor"

**Generic:** "Find a missing family member"
**Specific:** "Rescue my daughter from the Cult of the Serpent"

### Adjusting Time Frame

**Short-term (few sessions):**
- Make objective immediately achievable
- Complication is surmountable now
- "Obtain a powerful artifact" → "Steal the Ruby of Flames from the Baron's vault"

**Mid-term (6+ sessions):**
- Requires growth or resources
- Complication needs multiple steps to overcome
- "Slay a powerful monster" → "Kill the adult red dragon (need to reach level 10 first)"

**Long-term (campaign arc):**
- Epic scope
- Complication is major obstacle
- "Kill a god" → "Slay the God of Lies (requires gathering artifacts, allies, and ascending to demigod status)"

## Goal Overlap Opportunities

When generating goals for multiple PCs, look for overlap:

### Same Objective, Different Reasons
- PC1: "Obtain the Crown of Kings" (Claim birthright)
- PC2: "Obtain the Crown of Kings" (Destroy it to end monarchy)
- **Result:** Inevitable conflict and drama

### Same Location, Different Objectives
- PC1: "Find missing sister" (last seen in Dark Forest)
- PC2: "Slay powerful monster" (lives in Dark Forest)
- **Result:** Natural adventuring partnership

### Complimentary Complications
- PC1: "Unite warring factions" (but factions don't trust outsiders)
- PC2: "Prove myself worthy" (to one of those factions)
- **Result:** PC2's success helps PC1's goal

## Faction Goal Adaptation

Use these same tables for faction goals, adjusting pronouns:

**"This faction wants to [OBJECTIVE] because of [REASON], but [COMPLICATION]"**

### Faction Objective Adaptations (d20)
