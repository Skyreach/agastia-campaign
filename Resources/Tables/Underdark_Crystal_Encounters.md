## Usage Notes

**Encounter Frequency:**
- Roll once per 2-hour travel segment
- Adjust based on party's noise level, stealth, and route choices
- Some encounters can be avoided with successful skill checks

**Themes:**
- **Mind-Controlled:** Can be freed by destroying nearby crystals. May become grateful or simply flee
- **Crystal-Corrupted:** Environmental hazards mixed with creatures. Emphasize the crystals' strange influence
- **Desperate Addicts:** Tragic encounters. Creatures driven mad by water addiction. Can be pitied or fought

**Non-Combat Options:**
- **Grimlocks (3):** Can negotiate if party shows they're not seeking the water greedily
- **Rust Monster (10):** Can be distracted/lured with metal objects
- **Violet Fungi (7):** Can bypass with successful DC 13 Stealth or alternate route
- **Quaggoths (9):** Freeing them from crystal control may earn brief gratitude

**Environmental Details:**
Add these to encounters as appropriate:
- Red crystals pulsing with dim light (60 ft radius)
- Echo of distant waterfalls (sound carries strangely)
- Moisture increasing as party approaches Falls
- Skeletal remains (past victims) near crystals or in pools
- Mistfallen tribal markers (carved symbols warning away trespassers)

## Distance to Falls

Estimate **4-6 encounters** between cave entrance (where dragon was) and Garrek's Falls, representing approximately 8-12 hours of travel through the Underdark.

Adjust encounter frequency based on:
- Party's pace (fast = more encounters, slow/cautious = fewer)
- Rest breaks (long rest attracts attention)
- Noise level (combat attracts more creatures)
