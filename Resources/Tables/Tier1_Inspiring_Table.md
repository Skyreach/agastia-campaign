## TEMPERATE FORESTS (Tier 1)
**Roll 2d8**

| 2d8 | Encounter Theme |
|-----|-----------------|
| **2** | **Helpful Sprite Circle** |
| | A ring of mushrooms glows faintly in a moonlit glade where sprites feast on honeyed cakes and fermented berry wine. They're jovial and welcoming—”offering the party rest, food, and magical guidance in exchange for stories or songs. The sprites can point toward nearby points of interest, warn of dangers ahead, or grant a minor blessing (advantage on next Survival check). **Variation:** One sprite is actually a disguised pixie with access to polymorph and confusion, testing the party's worthiness. **Non-Combat:** The sprites offer to become allies if the party plants enchanted acorns at three specific locations, creating new faerie rings across the forest. |
| **3** | **Lost Mastiff** |
| | A skeletal, starving mastiff watches the party from the undergrowth, too scared to approach. It wears a rotted leather collar with a noble family's crest. If offered food, it bonds with whoever feeds it first and becomes fiercely loyal. **Variation:** The dog is being tracked by a bugbear who wants to eat it—”the bugbear arrives in 1d4 rounds after the party encounters the dog. **Non-Combat:** Following the collar's crest leads to a ruined estate where the dog's original owners were killed by bandits; treasure remains hidden in the wreckage. |
| **4** | **Awakened Shrub Choir** |
| | The party stumbles into a clearing where awakened shrubs sway and sing in terrible, off-key harmony. They're practicing for the Seasonal Celebration and desperately want an audience. The shrubs are harmless but incredibly annoying. **Variation:** One shrub is actually a twig blight spy sent by a gulthias tree—”it tries to lead the party into a trap. **Non-Combat:** If the party gives honest (even critical) feedback and helps them practice, the shrubs share knowledge of a nearby hidden spring that grants temporary hit points when drunk (1d8+1 temp HP, lasts until next rest). |
| **5** | **Pseudodragon Quarrel** |
| | Two pseudodragons are locked in an aerial squabble over a shiny object (a silver locket). They dive and snap at each other, occasionally crashing into trees. Neither wants to back down from this territorial dispute. **Variation:** The locket is actually cursed—”whoever touches it becomes the next target of their conflict until it's returned to its resting place (an old grave nearby). **Non-Combat:** The party can adjudicate the dispute; the grateful winner becomes a temporary companion for 1d4 days, or both pseudodragons flee, dropping the locket (worth 25 gp, or more if returned to rightful owner's family). |
| **6** | **Wandering Druid** |
| | An elderly druid sits by a babbling brook, smoking a pipe carved from oak root. She's monitoring the health of the forest and notes that "something dark stirs in the old hollow." She can provide healing, identify plants, and share rumors. **Variation:** She's actually a green hag in disguise, testing the party's intentions—”if they're cruel to nature, she becomes hostile. **Non-Combat:** If the party helps her gather medicinal herbs or clear corruption from a nearby grove, she grants them a charm that allows one free casting of *speak with animals*. |
| **7** | **Unicorn Sighting** |
| | A flash of silver-white catches the corner of someone's eye—”a unicorn stands at the forest's edge, watching the party with intelligent eyes. It bolts immediately, but those who saw it feel blessed (advantage on their next saving throw). **Variation:** If the party can track it (DC 16 Survival check with disadvantage—”it's very fast), they find it wounded by goblin arrows, creating a moral choice. **Non-Combat:** Healing the unicorn (or choosing not to pursue it) grants a more powerful blessing: the unicorn's horn glows and leaves behind a single silver hair that can cure one disease or poison (no action required). |
| **8** | **Goblin Ambush Site** |
| | The forest goes silent. Worg tracks and goblin footprints surround a freshly dug pit covered with branches and leaves. Crude wooden spikes line the bottom (2d6 piercing damage, DC 12 Dex save to avoid). Goblins watch from the bushes, hoping their trap succeeds. **Variation:** Instead of a few goblins, a bugbear leads the ambush party, using the goblins as expendable shock troops. **Non-Combat:** Keen-eyed characters (DC 14 Perception) spot the trap before triggering it and can either avoid it, disarm it, or turn it against pursuers. |
| **9** | **Spider's Hunting Ground** |
| | Massive webs stretch between ancient oaks, glistening with dew. Giant wolf spiders lurk in the canopy, and cocooned corpses dangle from branches—”some still twitching. An ettercap commands the spiders from a higher perch, chittering orders. **Variation:** One cocoon contains a still-living noble who will pay handsomely for rescue (or the spiders are defending egg sacs that will hatch in days, flooding the forest). **Non-Combat:** Sneaking through (DC 15 Stealth group check) or using fire to clear a safe path avoids the fight; investigating cocoons yields 2d20 gp in valuables. |
| **10** | **Territorial Owlbear** |
| | The earth shakes with heavy footfalls. An owlbear crashes through the underbrush, feathers bristling and beak clacking. It's protecting its nearby nest and views all intruders as threats. **Variation:** The owlbear is diseased or maddened by corrupted water, making it even more aggressive and unpredictable (add 10 HP, disadvantage to calm it). **Non-Combat:** A successful DC 16 Animal Handling check or offering 3 days of rations as a peace offering makes it back down; the party can choose to investigate the nest (containing a shiny obsidian egg worth 50 gp to collectors). |
| **11** | **Stirge Storm** |
| | A high-pitched buzzing fills the air as a thirst of stirges drops from the canopy like a crimson cloud. They're ravenous, having fed on a dying deer nearby. Blood frenzy makes them fearless. **Variation:** So many stirges descend that they count as two swarms instead of individual creatures; or they're fleeing from something even worse (a young green dragon arrives in 1d6 rounds). **Non-Combat:** Characters who immediately drop prone and cover themselves can avoid the initial assault (DC 13 Dex save); smoke or fire drives them off without a fight. |
| **12** | **Grick Ambush** |
| | Stone outcroppings line the forest path—”except they're not stone. Gricks slither from rocky crevices, their tentacles probing for prey. They've been starving and desperate for weeks. **Variation:** One grick is much larger (use grick alpha stats if available, or double HP), the alpha of the pack. **Non-Combat:** Tossing fresh meat (3 rations worth) into the rocks distracts them long enough to flee; following their trails leads to a cave filled with bones and 3d20 gp in coins. |
| **13** | **Hobgoblin Hunting Party** |
| | The crack of branches and barked orders in Goblin heralds the approach of disciplined hobgoblin scouts. They're tracking a thief who stole from their war band—”an urchin who nabbed food to feed his starving siblings. **Variation:** The hobgoblins are led by a captain who carries a banner marked with the symbol of a distant warlord—”killing him draws attention from a larger force. **Non-Combat:** The party can negotiate (hobgoblins respect strength and honesty), hand over the thief, hide the thief and bluff (DC 15 Deception), or learn the thief's location is in a nearby hollow tree. |
| **14** | **Corrupted Grove** |
| | A massive oak dominates a darkened grove, its trunk split and oozing shadow. Needle blights, twig blights, and vine blights emerge from the corruption, attacking mindlessly. At the center, liquid shadow bubbles from the tree's wound. **Variation:** The corruption is spreading—”a young gulthias tree is taking root, and if not destroyed, will spawn more blights weekly. **Non-Combat:** A DC 14 Nature or Religion check reveals the corruption can be cleansed with holy water and fire; doing so without fighting requires stealth (DC 16) but destroys the threat permanently. |
| **15** | **Ankheg Eruption** |
| | The ground trembles and explodes upward as an ankheg bursts from below, mandibles clacking. Its carapace bears strange metal tags—”someone has been studying it. **Variation:** The ankheg is protecting its burrowed eggs (3 eggs worth 100 gp each to scholars or tamers). **Non-Combat:** Investigations reveal the tags bear a wizard's mark; following the trail leads to an eccentric researcher who will pay 50 gp for information on the ankheg's behavior and location. |
| **16** | **Green Dragon's Domain** |
| | The forest grows unnaturally quiet and dark. Acrid fog rolls between the trees. A green dragon wyrmling watches from a high branch, studying the party with ancient, intelligent eyes. It speaks, offering a "trade"—”information for secrets, or safe passage for tribute. **Variation:** The wyrmling is genuinely curious and might become a recurring NPC if treated well, or it's setting up an ambush with goblin allies hidden nearby. **Non-Combat:** Clever negotiation, offering valuable information (secrets about local politics, treasure locations), or appealing to its vanity can result in the wyrmling letting the party pass or even granting a warning about nearby dangers. The wyrmling might demand one magic item or 50 gp in tribute. |

## ARCTIC / TUNDRA (Tier 1)
**Roll 2d6**

| 2d6 | Encounter Theme |
|-----|-----------------|
| **2** | **Friendly Reindeer Herders** |
| | A group of tribal warriors wrapped in thick furs tends a herd of elk (reindeer). They're friendly and offer to share hot stew, warm furs, and directions. Their elder speaks of "the white winds growing darker" and can provide a guide for 10 gp per day. **Variation:** One of the herders is a werebear in human form, protecting the tribe from afar. **Non-Combat:** The tribe offers shelter for the night; accepting grants advantage on saves against exhaustion from cold for 24 hours. They can also trade supplies (rations, cold-weather gear). |
| **3** | **Lost Saber-Tooth Cubs** |
| | Two adorable (but dangerous) saber-toothed tiger cubs play in the snow, pouncing on each other and mewling. They're separated from their mother, who is definitely looking for them nearby. **Variation:** The mother arrives in 1d4+1 rounds, enraged and protective (use saber-toothed tiger stats). **Non-Combat:** Calming the cubs (DC 14 Animal Handling) and leading them to fresh tracks reunites them with mother; she watches the party leave but doesn't attack, remembering the kindness. |
| **4** | **Frozen Shrine** |
| | Ice-covered standing stones form a circle around a frozen altar. Ethereal lights dance in the center—”will-o'-wisps or northern lights? Ancient runes mark the stones. **Variation:** The lights are actually ice mephits playing, or the shrine is sacred to a good deity and grants a blessing if offerings are made (10 gp in coins or valuables). **Non-Combat:** Reading the runes (DC 13 Religion/Arcana) reveals this is a shrine to a winter god; proper reverence grants resistance to cold damage for 24 hours. |
| **5** | **Goblin Ice-Fishers** |
| | A group of goblins huddle around holes in the ice, fishing with crude spears. They're desperate, half-starved, and argue over every small catch. They've been exiled from their tribe for incompetence. **Variation:** A winter wolf stalks them from a distance, planning to attack—”the goblins and party might have to work together. **Non-Combat:** Sharing food or teaching better fishing techniques (DC 12 Survival) makes them grateful; they share rumors of a frozen ship in the ice containing supplies. |
| **6** | **Mammoth Migration** |
| | The ground shakes with rhythmic thuds. A small herd of mammoths crosses the tundra, their thick fur crusted with ice. A calf stumbles, struggling to keep up. **Variation:** One mammoth is injured by hunters' spears and is dangerously aggressive. **Non-Combat:** Helping the calf (physically assisting it or clearing its path) earns the herd's tolerance; the matriarch's dung can be harvested for excellent fire-starting material (advantage on Survival checks to start fires in cold weather). |
| **7** | **Ice Mephit Mischief** |
| | Childish laughter echoes across the ice as ice mephits play pranks—”freezing water skins, creating icy patches, throwing snowballs. They're more annoying than dangerous but won't stop unless made to. **Variation:** A bheur hag watches from afar, using the mephits to test the party's resolve. **Non-Combat:** Playing along with their games (ability checks in a skill challenge) entertains them enough that they leave peacefully, gifting the party a small ice sculpture worth 10 gp. |
| **8** | **Polar Bear Hunt** |
| | Fresh blood stains the snow. A polar bear has killed a seal and is feeding, but it notices the party. It's protective of its meal but not immediately hostile. **Variation:** The bear is a dire polar bear (double HP, extra damage die) or a werebear in animal form who can be reasoned with. **Non-Combat:** Giving the bear space (backing away slowly, DC 12 group Stealth check) lets everyone avoid conflict. The seal carcass can be harvested for food and valuable blubber. |
| **9** | **Frozen Dead** |
| | Humanoid shapes lurch through a blizzard—”zombies, preserved perfectly by the ice. They wear the uniforms of an expedition from decades ago. A frozen noble among them clutches a journal (revealing their fate) and wears a signet ring (worth 25 gp). **Variation:** The zombies are accompanied by a wight, their former leader, who commands them with tactical precision. **Non-Combat:** The zombies are slow; outrunning them (DC 12 group Athletics through snow) works. The journal reveals the location of their camp with supplies. |
| **10** | **Winter Wolf Pack** |
| | Howls echo across the waste. Winter wolves materialize from the snow, their white fur making them nearly invisible. They circle, testing the party for weakness. **Variation:** The pack alpha is enormous (add 15 HP, extra attack) or a werewolf leads them. **Non-Combat:** A show of strength (intimidation check, displaying fire, or successfully standing ground) makes the pack back down. They're hunting elk, not desperate for humanoid prey. |
| **11** | **Kobold Dragon Cultists** |
| | Fanatical kobolds wearing makeshift white dragon symbols ambush from snow banks. They serve a white dragon wyrmling they've proclaimed as their god and attack in its name with zealous fury. **Variation:** The wyrmling watches from a high ice cliff, swooping down to "save" its followers if they're losing. **Non-Combat:** Showing respect for their "god" (DC 15 Persuasion or Performance) or convincing them you serve a greater dragon makes them hesitate, potentially leading to information about their lair. |
| **12** | **Orc Raiding Party** |
| | Battle-scarred orcs pursue a lone polar bear through the snow, hooting with excitement. They're from a larger war band and are testing their courage. When they see the party, they turn their attention to "better prey." **Variation:** An orc war chief (use orog stats) leads them, making the fight significantly harder. **Non-Combat:** Challenging their leader to single combat (champion vs. champion) satisfies their honor; defeating or impressing them gains their respect and they leave peacefully, possibly offering information about the area. |

## MOUNTAINS (Tier 1)
**Roll 2d10**

| 2d10 | Encounter Theme |
|-----|-----------------|
| **2** | **Dwarven Sentries** |
| | A watch post built into the mountainside houses several dwarven guards keeping watch over a hidden mine entrance. They're wary but not hostile, demanding to know the party's business. If respectful, the dwarves share ale, mining rumors, and warn of dangers ahead. **Variation:** One dwarf is actually a duergar spy trying to learn the mine's schedules. **Non-Combat:** Trading goods (especially alcohol or worked metal) earns goodwill; the dwarves might offer shelter in their guardhouse or mark the party's map with safe paths. |
| **3** | **Aarakocra Scouts** |
| | Bird-like humanoids circle overhead, their keen eyes scanning the mountains. They descend to investigate strangers in their territory but are cautious rather than aggressive. They speak of "the dark thing in the eastern peaks" and can provide aerial reconnaissance. **Variation:** They're refugees fleeing from a gargoyle infestation and need help reclaiming their nesting grounds. **Non-Combat:** Offering gifts of shiny objects or helping with a simple task (retrieve a lost item blown by wind to a dangerous ledge) earns their friendship and valuable scouting information. |
| **4** | **Mountain Goat Herd** |
| | Sure-footed goats traverse impossible cliff faces, grazing on sparse mountain vegetation. A golden goat with unusual markings leads the herd—”local legend says it brings good fortune. **Variation:** The golden goat is actually a polymorphed gold dragon wyrmling observing humanoids. **Non-Combat:** Following the goats reveals a safe path through treacherous terrain. The golden goat's tracks lead to a hidden shrine where offerings grant a blessing (advantage on next ability check to avoid falling). |
| **5** | **Rope Bridge** |
| | An ancient rope bridge spans a massive chasm. It sways dangerously in the wind, and several planks are missing or rotted. A weathered sign warns: "Cross at own risk." **Variation:** Harpies nest beneath the bridge and attack anyone crossing, or a stone giant on the far side is repairing the bridge and can be convinced to help. **Non-Combat:** Clever engineering (DC 13 Investigation + Rope Use) reinforces the bridge safely. Finding an alternate route (DC 15 Survival) takes 2 hours but avoids all danger. |
| **6** | **Eagle's Nest** |
| | A giant eagle circles a rocky spire where its nest sits, visible from the path. The eagle is protective but not immediately aggressive—”unless someone approaches the nest. **Variation:** The nest contains a golden egg (actually a rare stone worth 75 gp) or wounded human caught by the eagle days ago. **Non-Combat:** Leaving offerings of fresh meat allows safe passage. Helping a wounded eagle earns its temporary companionship as a scout for one day. |
| **7** | **Hermit's Cave** |
| | A thin column of smoke rises from a shallow cave. Inside, an elderly human (scout stats) lives in solitude, studying the stars and keeping records of mountain weather. He's eccentric but knowledgeable. **Variation:** He's actually a retired assassin hiding from old enemies, or he's being slowly driven mad by proximity to a corrupted shrine. **Non-Combat:** Trading news from civilization or helping with chores earns a detailed map of the area including hidden paths and hazards (advantage on Survival checks in these mountains for 3 days). |
| **8** | **Kobold Trappers** |
| | Crude snares and tripwires litter the narrow path. Kobolds watch from concealed positions in the rocks, ready to spring their trap—”a net drop and spike pit combo. They serve a white dragon wyrmling in the higher peaks. **Variation:** A winged kobold (urd) leads them, using hit-and-run tactics from above. **Non-Combat:** Spotting the traps (DC 14 Perception) allows avoidance. Intimidating the kobolds (DC 13 Intimidation, easier if dragon-related) makes them flee; their lair contains small treasures (2d20 gp). |
| **9** | **Rockslide** |
| | A distant rumble grows louder—”tons of rock and scree cascade down the mountainside. Either natural or triggered by something above. **Variation:** Orcs deliberately caused the rockslide to block pursuit or trap the party, or a remorhaz burrowing caused the collapse. **Non-Combat:** A DC 15 Perception check provides warning to seek shelter. Successfully sheltering takes no damage; caught in the open requires DC 14 Dex saves to avoid 3d6 bludgeoning damage. The debris field might reveal a cave entrance previously hidden. |
| **10** | **Orc Raiders** |
| | A band of orcs picks through the wreckage of a merchant caravan, arguing over loot. They're from a larger mountain tribe and view the party as either more plunder or a worthy fight. **Variation:** An orog leads them with tactical precision, or they have captured prisoners they're preparing to ransom or enslave. **Non-Combat:** If the party rescued the prisoners quietly or convinces the orcs they're not worth fighting (DC 14 Intimidation/Persuasion, showing strength), the orcs might even trade information about safe paths for goods. |
| **11** | **Gargoyle Guardian** |
| | A stone gargoyle perches at a narrow pass, perfectly still. Ancient script at its base reads: "Only the worthy may pass." It animates when approached, demanding a toll or test. **Variation:** Multiple gargoyles guard a forgotten temple entrance, or the gargoyle is corrupted and attacks mindlessly. **Non-Combat:** Answering a riddle correctly, paying a toll (10 gp in gems placed in an offering bowl), or demonstrating bravery grants passage. The gargoyle's chamber contains clues to a nearby treasure. |
| **12** | **Harpy Ambush** |
| | Beautiful songs echo off the cliff faces—”haunting and alluring. Harpies perch on high ledges, their luring song compelling creatures to walk off edges (DC 11 Wisdom save to resist). Below their aerie, bones and loot litter the rocks. **Variation:** A harpy matriarch (add 10 HP, extra attack) leads the flock, or they're protecting eggs that could be valuable to collectors. **Non-Combat:** Deafening the party (cotton in ears, *silence* spell) negates the song. Climbing to their aerie while they're away (hunting pattern) allows looting without confrontation (3d20 gp in treasures). |
| **13** | **Peryton Hunt** |
| | A shadow passes overhead—”a peryton circles, its stag-headed silhouette ominous against the sky. It's hunting for humanoid hearts, which it needs to reproduce. **Variation:** A mated pair hunts together, coordinating attacks, or the peryton is wounded and desperate. **Non-Combat:** Taking cover in a rocky overhang or cave makes aerial attacks impossible; the peryton eventually gives up for easier prey. Its shadow always matches a humanoid, unnerving those who notice (DC 12 Insight). |
| **14** | **Basilisk Territory** |
| | Unusually realistic stone statues line the path—”adventurers, merchants, even animals, all frozen in terror. A basilisk lurks nearby, its petrifying gaze a constant threat. **Variation:** Multiple basilisks nest here, or a medusa controls the basilisk as a guardian. **Non-Combat:** Navigating with eyes averted (DC 15 group check) or using mirrors to watch for the basilisk avoids the gaze. One statue can be restored with *lesser restoration* or similar magic—”a grateful survivor who provides information. |
| **15** | **Magma Vent** |
| | Superheated air blasts from a crack in the mountain. Magma mephits and magmin bubble up from the depths, playful and destructive in equal measure. They're drawn to warmth and fire. **Variation:** An azer craftsman works at a natural forge nearby, willing to trade metalwork for protection from the pests, or the vent is growing, threatening to explode. **Non-Combat:** Sealing the vent (DC 16 Investigation + appropriate magic or tools) stops the emergence. The superheated area can be used to forge or repair metal equipment with advantage. |
| **16** | **Ogre Ambush** |
| | A massive boulder flies toward the party—”an ogre attacks from higher ground, hurling rocks before closing for melee. Its cave lair is visible behind it, filled with bones and stolen goods. **Variation:** Two ogres work together, or the ogre has captured a prize prisoner (noble, merchant) worth ransom. **Non-Combat:** The ogre is stupid and easily tricked (DC 12 Deception)—”convincing it the party works for someone scarier makes it back down. Its lair contains 4d20 gp and random equipment from victims. |
| **17** | **Ettin's Crossroads** |
| | An ettin sits at a fork in the mountain path, its two heads arguing loudly about which direction is "safer." One head wants to eat the party; the other wants to rob them. They can't agree. **Variation:** The ettin is extraordinarily stupid even for its kind, or clever characters realize the "safer" path leads to the ettin's lair filled with traps. **Non-Combat:** Exploiting the heads' disagreement (DC 13 Persuasion or Deception to play them against each other) makes them too distracted to fight. Bribing them with food (10 days rations) satisfies the eating head. |
| **18** | **Wyvern Nest** |
| | A wyvern roosts on a high ledge, its poisonous tail dripping venom. It watches the party with predatory intelligence but hasn't committed to attacking yet—”it's well-fed from a recent kill. **Variation:** The wyvern is protecting eggs (worth 200 gp each to collectors) or is injured and cornered, making it more dangerous. **Non-Combat:** Staying low and quiet (DC 15 Stealth group check) lets the party pass beneath without drawing attention. The wyvern's recent kill (visible on the ledge) is a merchant whose pack contains valuables. |
| **19** | **White Dragon Wyrmling** |
| | Frost coats everything as a white dragon wyrmling swoops from the heights, screeching territorially. Unlike other dragons, it's feral and savage rather than clever—”pure predatory instinct. **Variation:** The wyrmling is unnaturally large (add 20 HP) or has been magically enslaved by kobolds who follow it. **Non-Combat:** The wyrmling respects shows of strength more than negotiation—”a successful DC 16 Intimidation check makes it wary enough to circle and leave. Its lair (a frozen cave) contains 5d20 gp worth of frozen coins and gems. |
| **20** | **Frost Giant Sentry** |
| | An enormous frost giant stands watch at a narrow pass, blocking the way forward. She's on duty, preventing "smallfolk" from discovering her clan's settlement beyond. She's bored and might be convinced to let the party pass—”or she might want entertainment. **Variation:** She's accompanied by winter wolves as companions, or she's looking for slaves and tries to capture rather than kill. **Non-Combat:** Entertaining her with stories, contests of strength, or tribute (valuable furs, gems worth 50+ gp) earns passage. She might even provide information about the path ahead if impressed. Warning: her clan lies ahead, and she'll describe them if asked. |

---

## DESERTS (Tier 1)
**Roll 2d8**

| 2d8 | Encounter Theme |
|-----|-----------------|
| **2** | **Oasis Haven** |
| | A beautiful oasis appears—”palm trees, fresh water, shade, and fruit. A disguised couatl (appearing as a beggar woman) tests the party's generosity by asking for water. **Variation:** The oasis is real but protected by a territorial brass dragon wyrmling who demands stories in exchange for access, or it's a mirage hiding a far more modest (but real) water source. **Non-Combat:** Sharing water freely with the beggar earns the couatl's blessing (remove one level of exhaustion for each party member, or a charm granting advantage against being frightened). Refusing reveals the test but grants nothing. |
| **3** | **Merchant Caravan** |
| | A noble merchant traveling with guards leads a caravan of camels across the sands. They're friendly and willing to trade (at steep prices), share news, and warnings about dangers ahead. **Variation:** One of the guards is a bandit captain planning to betray and rob the merchant at nightfall, or bandits are tracking the caravan. **Non-Combat:** Trading goods, providing protection, or warning about dangers earns discounts and a potential recurring NPC merchant contact. The merchant knows all regional rumors. |
| **4** | **Mischievous Dust Mephits** |
| | Giggling dust devils spin across the sands—”dust mephits play in the heat, creating sandstorms and hiding the party's tracks. They're more annoying than dangerous, stealing small objects and creating visibility problems. **Variation:** A dao watches from a distance, using the mephits to test visitors to its territory. **Non-Combat:** Playing along with their games (skill challenge—”athletics, performance, acrobatics) entertains them; they reward good sports with knowledge of a nearby shelter or water source. |
| **5** | **Lost Lizard Herd** |
| | A dozen giant lizards scatter across the dunes, spooked by something. They're not hostile unless cornered, but they're also valuable—”each could be a mount with proper training. **Variation:** Whatever spooked them (gnolls, giant scorpions, or a blue dragon wyrmling) arrives in 1d4 rounds. **Non-combat:** Successful animal handling (DC 15) captures 1d4 lizards as potential mounts. Following their backtrail reveals what frightened them and potentially treasure from their flight source. |
| **6** | **Ancient Ruins** |
| | Half-buried stone columns and crumbling walls mark an ancient settlement swallowed by sand. Strange symbols warn of curses, but the structure might offer shelter from the sun. **Variation:** The ruins are protected by mummies or animated skeletons, or they contain a working shrine that grants blessings. **Non-Combat:** Excavating carefully (DC 13 Investigation) reveals a sealed chamber with preserved supplies (water, rations) and 3d20 gp in ancient coins. The shade provides refuge from desert heat (advantage on saves against exhaustion). |
| **7** | **Gnoll Scavengers** |
| | Hyena laughter echoes across dunes. Gnolls pick through the remains of a merchant caravan, fighting over scraps. They haven't noticed the party yet, but gnolls are always hungry for more. **Variation:** A gnoll fang of Yeenoghu leads them (more powerful, demonic influence), or giant hyenas accompany them. **Non-Combat:** Sneaking past (DC 14 group Stealth) avoids the fight. Waiting until they leave allows looting what remains (2d10 gp, damaged trade goods). |
| **8** | **Scorpion Nest** |
| | Dozens of regular scorpions swarm from beneath a rocky outcrop—”their mother, a giant scorpion, emerges protectively. The rocks offer the only shade for miles. **Variation:** Multiple giant scorpions nest here, or the scorpions are diseased (Con saves against poison are at disadvantage). **Non-Combat:** Smoking them out or creating a distraction (tossed meat, fire) clears the nest. The outcrop contains a small cave with blessed water that cures disease (3 uses). |
| **9** | **Jackalwere Ambush** |
| | Jackals circle the party, seeming curious rather than aggressive. When the party makes camp or lets their guard down, they shift to humanoid form and attack, trying to steal supplies rather than kill. **Variation:** They serve a lamia who watches from a distant dune, or they're recruiting for a larger jackalwere pack. **Non-Combat:** Detecting their true nature (DC 14 Insight or Arcana) allows preparation. They flee if seriously injured, leading back to their lair (containing stolen goods worth 4d10 gp). |
| **10** | **Sandstorm** |
| | Dark clouds appear on the horizon—”a massive sandstorm approaches. Without shelter, the party faces 1d6 hours of blinding sand, exhaustion, and getting hopelessly lost. **Variation:** The sandstorm is unnatural, created by an efreeti or air elemental, or it hides the approach of a blue dragon wyrmling who hunts during storms. **Non-Combat:** Finding shelter (DC 15 Survival) provides safety. Magic like *wind wall* or *gust of wind* can carve a safe zone. The storm passes, revealing previously buried ruins or an oasis. |
| **11** | **Death Dogs** |
| | Snarling two-headed hounds bound across the dunes, their disease-ridden bites a serious threat. They're hunting something (fleeing merchants, escaped slaves, or just prey) and the party is in the way. **Variation:** A gnoll packmaster controls them, or they're infected with a supernatural disease that animates their corpses as zombies if killed. **Non-Combat:** Throwing poisoned meat (requires poison, rations, and DC 12 Nature check) neutralizes them. Intimidation (DC 14) makes them wary of stronger predators. |
| **12** | **Mummy Guardian** |
| | A mummy emerges from beneath the sand near a half-buried tomb entrance, ancient wrappings fluttering. It attacks intruders to its master's rest—”unless properly placated. **Variation:** Multiple mummies guard a greater tomb, or the mummy can speak and demands an offering to pass. **Non-Combat:** Showing proper respect (religious rites, offering treasures to the tomb, DC 13 Religion check) satisfies its purpose. The tomb interior holds treasure but also additional undead (or curses). |
| **13** | **Phase Spider** |
| | Reality shimmers as a phase spider flickers in and out of the Ethereal Plane, stalking the party. Its ethereal webs are almost invisible, and it attacks from unexpected angles. **Variation:** It's protecting an egg sac (worth 100 gp to collectors), or it's been summoned/controlled by a desert wizard. **Non-Combat:** *See invisibility* or similar magic reveals its patterns. Destroying its web anchor points (DC 14 Perception to find, then Athletics to break) forces it to flee. Its lair contains victims' treasures (3d20 gp). |
| **14** | **Blue Dragon Wyrmling** |
| | Thunder cracks as a vain blue dragon wyrmling circles overhead, studying the party with calculating eyes. Unlike savage white dragons, it's intelligent and might negotiate—”for the right price. **Variation:** It's accompanied by kobold cultists who worship it, or it's young enough to be overconfident and underestimate the party. **Non-Combat:** Flattery and tribute (gems worth 50+ gp, magical items, or secrets/information) satisfy its vanity. It might even provide information about dangers ahead, warn about rivals, or safe passage through its territory in exchange for future tribute. |
| **15** | **Giant Scorpion Ambush** |
| | Sand explodes as a giant scorpion erupts from beneath, pincers snapping and poisonous tail arcing. It's been lying in wait near the only water source for miles. **Variation:** Two giant scorpions hunt together, or it's protecting young (smaller scorpions that swarm). **Non-Combat:** Approaching the water source carefully (DC 16 Perception spots the trap). Smoking it out or creating vibrations elsewhere (distant noise, thrown rocks) triggers the ambush early, allowing avoidance. |
| **16** | **Lamia's Lair** |
| | Crumbling ruins shimmer in the heat. Inside, a lamia reclines on stolen cushions, surrounded by jackalwere servants and charmed slaves. She's decadent, cruel, and bored—”perfect motivation to toy with visitors. **Variation:** She's working with a jackalwere pack to raid caravans, or she possesses a magic item the party needs. **Non-Combat:** Engaging her in conversation, wit, or games of chance (she loves gambling) might earn information or safe passage. She respects cunning and charm more than strength. She'll trade information for entertainment or unique treasures. Her slaves can be freed if she's defeated or distracted. |

## JUNGLES (Tier 1)
**Roll 2d10**

| 2d10 | Encounter Theme |
|-----|-----------------|
| **2** | **Friendly Lizardfolk Village** |
| | Wooden platforms built in the trees mark a lizardfolk settlement. The inhabitants are cautious but not hostile, curious about outsiders. Their shaman seeks ingredients for healing rituals and will trade information for help. **Variation:** They're preparing defenses against a young green dragon that's been harassing them, or yuan-ti infiltrators hide among them. **Non-Combat:** Helping gather medicinal plants (DC 12 Nature or Survival) earns goodwill, maps of safe paths, warnings about territorial dinosaurs, and possibly a guide for 5 gp per day. They can also teach jungle survival techniques (advantage on next Survival check). |
| **3** | **Couatl's Test** |
| | A magnificent feathered serpent coils around a ancient tree, its rainbow scales gleaming. The couatl observes the party with benevolent but judging eyes, testing their worthiness with a question or request. **Variation:** The couatl is injured and needs healing, or it guards a sacred grove and demands the party prove they mean no harm. **Non-Combat:** Answering truthfully, showing kindness to nature, or helping with a task (clearing corruption, healing wounded animals) earns the couatl's blessing (charm that grants one free use of *cure wounds* or *lesser restoration*). It may also provide prophecy or guidance. |
| **4** | **Awakened Tree Guardian** |
| | An ancient tree suddenly opens eyes of amber sap and speaks in a deep, creaking voice. It's awakened, watching over this section of jungle, and wants to know the party's intentions. **Variation:** Multiple awakened trees form a grove council, or the tree is dying and seeks help against a corruption spreading through the jungle. **Non-Combat:** Respectful conversation and promises not to harm the jungle earn passage and information. The tree can point toward water sources, warn about territorial creatures, or share ancient lore. It might gift a branch that can be used as a club or staff. |
| **5** | **Fruit Tree Bounty** |
| | A massive tree bears strange star-shaped neon green fruits that glow faintly. They smell sweet and inviting. Tribal markings on the trunk suggest local significance. **Variation:** The fruits are protected by poisonous insects, or eating too many causes hallucinations (DC 13 Con save or trip for 1 hour). **Non-Combat:** Each fruit restores 1d8+1 HP when eaten (up to 2d10 fruits available). Harvesting draws attention from protective apes or tribal warriors who demand respect for the sacred tree. Proper offerings (shiny objects, tools) earn permission. |
| **6** | **Tribal Warriors** |
| | Face-painted warriors melt out of the jungle, spears ready. They're protecting their territory from outsiders but aren't automatically hostile—”they want to understand the party's intentions. **Variation:** They're hunting a dangerous predator (tyrannosaur, giant ape) and could use help, or they're fleeing from yuan-ti slavers. **Non-Combat:** Communication through gestures and gifts (DC 13 Persuasion) establishes peaceful contact. They can provide guides, trade goods, warn about dangers (particularly carnivorous plants and dinosaurs), and might request help with a problem. |
| **7** | **Monkey Mischief** |
| | Chattering, screeching monkeys (use baboon stats) swarm through the canopy, stealing anything shiny or edible. They're more annoying than dangerous, but they're persistent thieves. **Variation:** A giant ape leads them, or they're fleeing from a predator (giant snake, panther) that arrives soon. **Non-Combat:** Offering food as a distraction works temporarily. Following them leads to their nest, which contains 3d20 gp worth of stolen trinkets and coins. Befriending them (DC 14 Animal Handling) makes them potential scouts/alarm systems. |
| **8** | **Swarm Territory** |
| | The air fills with buzzing as thousands of insects rise from rotting vegetation. Bats burst from caves, snakes slither from trees—”the jungle's small dangers become overwhelming in numbers. **Variation:** Multiple swarms attack at once (insects + bats, or insects + poisonous snakes), or a corrupted area spawns supernatural swarms. **Non-Combat:** Smoke, fire, or repellent herbs (DC 12 Nature to identify, DC 10 Survival to apply) drive them away. Running through (DC 13 Athletics) escapes the territory. The swarm area might protect something valuable (hidden ruins, fruit trees). |
| **9** | **Giant Frog Pond** |
| | A murky pond blocks the path, its surface broken by enormous lily pads. Giant frogs lurk beneath, their tongues capable of snatching and swallowing creatures whole. **Variation:** One frog is enormous (use giant toad stats, add 10 HP), or the pond contains a sunken chest (3d20 gp worth of trade goods). **Non-Combat:** Circling the pond (adds 1 hour travel) avoids them. Throwing large amounts of meat as distraction allows crossing. The frogs are territorial, not aggressive—”leaving them alone lets everyone avoid conflict. |
| **10** | **Flying Snake Nest** |
| | Colorful serpents glide between branches, their wings catching sunlight. They're beautiful but venomous, defending their nesting area aggressively. **Variation:** One snake is magically enhanced (double HP, improved poison) by a local druid, or they guard rare orchids worth 50 gp to alchemists. **Non-Combat:** *Speak with animals* reveals they just want to be left alone. Climbing around their territory (DC 14 Athletics) avoids confrontation. Their shed skins can be harvested for poison-making materials. |
| **11** | **Axe Beak Flock** |
| | Large, flightless birds with powerful beaks and talons charge from the undergrowth, protecting their nearby nesting grounds. They're territorial and aggressive. **Variation:** The nest contains eggs worth 25 gp each to collectors (3 eggs), or a velociraptor pack has been hunting them, arriving shortly. **Non-Combat:** Backing away slowly while making noise (DC 12 Animal Handling or Intimidation) satisfies their territorial display. The nest area can be marked on a map—”traders pay for exotic bird egg locations. |
| **12** | **Basilisk Den** |
| | Stone statues of animals and humanoids litter a clearing—”all frozen mid-motion. A basilisk makes its lair here, using the statues as both warning and hunting blind. **Variation:** Multiple basilisks nest together, or a medusa controls the basilisk and uses it as a guardian. **Non-Combat:** Navigating blindfolded or with mirror vision (DC 15 group check) avoids the gaze. One statue might be recently petrified and restorable (*greater restoration* or similar). The basilisk's stomach contains 3d20 gp in swallowed valuables. |
| **13** | **Kobold Harvesters** |
| | Small, scaly figures pick through giant lizard droppings, collecting shiny objects and scales. The kobolds are more cowardly than aggressive and flee when confronted. **Variation:** They serve a green dragon wyrmling and carry treasure to it, or they've set elaborate traps throughout the area. **Non-Combat:** Intimidation (DC 12) scares them off immediately. Following them leads to either their lair (small treasures, traps) or their dragon master's location. They'll trade information for food or shiny objects. |
| **14** | **Cockatrice Glade** |
| | A glade filled with beautiful flowers also contains several stone chickens—”failed cockatrices who pecked their reflections in a pool. Living cockatrices strut about, their petrifying beaks a danger to all. **Variation:** A dozen cockatrices nest here (overwhelming numbers), or someone polymorphed them to guard treasure hidden in the glade. **Non-Combat:** Throwing meat or grain as distraction allows circumventing the glade. The petrified forms can be studied for alchemical components. The pool's water has minor magic properties (DC 13 Arcana to identify). |
| **15** | **Giant Constrictor Snake** |
| | A massive serpent coils around a ancient statue, nearly indistinguishable from the stone until it moves. It's hungry and patient, waiting for prey to approach what it's coiled around (which might be valuable). **Variation:** The statue is magical and the snake is protecting it, or the snake has just fed and isn't immediately aggressive. **Non-Combat:** Waiting until it hunts (it must eat regularly) allows safe approach to the statue. *Speak with animals* or offerings of fresh meat (10 days rations) satisfy it temporarily. The statue might be a petrified person or hold hidden treasure. |
| **16** | **Giant Ape Territory** |
| | The jungle shakes with mighty roars. An enormous silverback ape crashes through vegetation, beating its chest in threat display. It views the party as rivals or threats to its family group. **Variation:** A mated pair with young attack together (overwhelming action economy), or the ape has been magically enhanced by a druid. **Non-Combat:** Submissive postures and backing away (DC 15 Animal Handling or Intimidation to out-alpha) makes it accept dominance display. It won't pursue beyond its territory. Defeating it non-lethally earns respect—”it might even help against a greater threat. |
| **17** | **Vine Blight Infestation** |
| | Vines writhe with unnatural life, strangling trees and blocking paths. Vine blights emerge from the corruption, attacking silently. At the center grows something dark—”a young gulthias tree or corrupted shrine. **Variation:** A green hag planted the corruption, or the blights serve a treant driven mad by disease. **Non-Combat:** Fire clears paths through blights (they're vulnerable). Finding and destroying the corruption source (DC 14 Nature to identify, then appropriate magic or holy water) ends the threat without fighting every blight. The area might hold buried treasure from previous victims. |
| **18** | **Green Dragon Wyrmling** |
| | Acrid fog rolls through the jungle. A green dragon wyrmling perches on a branch, studying the party with ancient, cunning eyes. Unlike brutish white dragons, it enjoys manipulation and deals—”for the right price. **Variation:** It's using the party to eliminate a rival (another predator, yuan-ti scout party), or it has charmed a local tribe to serve it. **Non-Combat:** Negotiation, flattery, and information-trading can work (DC 14 Persuasion, easier with valuable information or tribute). It might demand tribute (one magic item or 50 gp in gems) for safe passage, or offer a deal: eliminate its rival for promised treasure. Its breath weapon makes it dangerous, so it knows it has leverage. |
| **19** | **Tyrannosaur Hunt** |
| | The ground shakes with massive footfalls. Trees crash as an enormous predator approaches—”a Tyrannosaurus Rex on the hunt. Its vision is actually quite good, contrary to popular belief, and it's very hungry. **Variation:** Two tyrannosaurs hunt together (mated pair), or it's being pursued by lizardfolk hunters who might help. **Non-Combat:** Hiding completely (DC 16 Stealth group check, disadvantage in open areas) lets it pass. Using strong-smelling substances or leading it to recent kill (if available) distracts it. Climbing to safety (it can't climb well) works if escape routes exist. The tyrannosaur might be chasing other prey—”letting it catch that instead saves the party. |
| **20** | **Yuan-ti Ambush** |
| | Serpentine figures emerge from concealment—”yuan-ti purebloods backed by tribal warriors they've charmed or enslaved. They seek captives for sacrifice or slaves for their temple city. **Variation:** A yuan-ti malison leads them (more powerful, magic), or they guard the approach to a major yuan-ti stronghold. **Non-Combat:** Displaying snake-related symbols or claiming to serve "the Scaled Ones" (DC 15 Deception) might gain temporary standing. They value cunning and ruthlessness—”convincing them the party is more useful as allies than slaves (DC 16 Persuasion) could work. Escape is possible if the party flees immediately—”yuan-ti won't pursue far from their territory without good reason. Their goal is securing the temple, not chasing random adventurers. |

---

## SWAMPS (Tier 1)
**Roll 2d6**

| 2d6 | Encounter Theme |
|-----|-----------------|
| **2** | **Will-o'-Wisp Guides** |
| | Ghostly lights dance across the misty fen, beckoning the party to follow. Unlike most will-o'-wisps, these lights actually lead to safety—”a dry island with an ancient shrine offering rest and clean water. **Variation:** The wisps are the spirits of helpful dead who want travelers to find safety, or they're testing the party before leading them to treasure. **Non-Combat:** Following the lights (DC 12 Insight to trust them, or DC 14 Survival to verify they're leading somewhere safe) reveals the shrine. Leaving an offering (10 gp in coins) grants a blessing (advantage on saves against disease for 24 hours). Ignoring them means missing the safe rest spot. |
| **3** | **Helpful Sprite** |
| | A tiny sprite emerges from a glowing flower, claiming to know the safest paths through the swamp. She's lonely and desperate for conversation but genuinely helpful. **Variation:** She's fleeing from a hag and asks for protection, or she guards a specific path for the Swamp Queen (a good-aligned treant or fey). **Non-Combat:** Treating her kindly earns a guided tour through safe paths (no random encounters for 4 hours) and warnings about dangers. She might gift a flower that cures one poison or disease. Harming or threatening her brings bad luck (disadvantage on Survival checks in swamps for 1 week). |
| **4** | **Giant Frogs** |
| | Lazy croaking echoes from oversized lily pads. Giant toads and frogs sun themselves, occasionally snapping at passing dragonflies. They're lethargic and well-fed. **Variation:** One frog has a ruby in its belly from a previous meal (worth 100 gp, visible through translucent stomach), or they guard a submerged chest. **Non-Combat:** Walking quietly past (DC 12 Stealth) doesn't disturb them. One frog might belch up a valuable gem as the party passes—”a lucky omen. Their slime can be harvested for alchemical ingredients (DC 12 Nature check, produces 2d4 doses of poison antidote material). |
| **5** | **Lost Dwarf** |
| | A waterlogged dwarf, tied to a floating log, calls weakly for help. He's a merchant who was robbed and left to die by bandits upriver. He's got information and reward money—”if he survives. **Variation:** He's actually a were-dwarf who transforms at night, or the bandits are still nearby tracking him to ensure he dies. **Non-Combat:** Rescuing him earns gratitude and 25 gp immediately, plus information about bandit camps, swamp hazards, and a promised reward of 100 gp if returned to his home city. He knows the location of a safe dry camp nearby. |
| **6** | **Cursed Statue** |
| | A barnacle-covered statue of a frog dominates a small island. Rubies glint in its eyes (each worth 20 gp), but it radiates faint magic. Disturbing it triggers a curse. **Variation:** The statue is actually a petrified frog god who will bless those who clean and honor it, or the rubies are fake and removing them alerts nearby bullywugs. **Non-Combat:** DC 13 Arcana reveals the curse nature. Proper religious ceremony (DC 12 Religion) allows safe ruby removal. Ignoring the statue means no risk. Taking rubies without ceremony curses the thief (disadvantage on all saves until *remove curse*). |
| **7** | **Bullywug Fishermen** |
| | Croaking frog-men pole primitive rafts through the shallows, spearing fish with practiced ease. They're initially wary of intruders but cowardly if confronted. **Variation:** They're led by a bullywug chief (better stats), or they're fleeing from something worse (lizardfolk raiders, a black dragon). **Non-Combat:** Sharing food or giving gifts (especially shiny objects) makes them friendly. They'll trade information about safe paths, dangerous areas, and swamp hazards for food or trinkets worth 5 gp. Intimidation (DC 11) scares them away entirely. |
| **8** | **Poisonous Snakes** |
| | The waters teem with serpents—”regular and giant poisonous snakes coil around cypress knees and hang from branches. Their territory must be crossed. **Variation:** A yuan-ti pureblood has charmed them as guardians, or they protect a sunken shrine containing treasure. **Non-Combat:** Using repellent herbs (DC 12 Nature to identify/prepare), smoke, or fire clears a path. Wading carefully (DC 13 Stealth group check) disturbs them minimally. The snakes can be harvested for venom after combat (3d4 doses worth 10 gp each). |
| **9** | **Zombie Ambush** |
| | Waterlogged corpses rise from the murky water, muck-covered and moaning. These bog zombies are preserved by the swamp's acidity but still dangerous. **Variation:** Many more zombies rise (double the number), or a wight commands them from a dry island. **Non-Combat:** The zombies are slow; running (DC 11 Athletics to wade quickly through terrain) escapes them. They won't pursue beyond their spawning area. The sunken ground they rose from might contain waterlogged valuables (2d20 gp in corroded coins). |
| **10** | **Cult Sacrifice** |
| | Torchlight flickers through the mist. A cult fanatic and robed followers prepare to sacrifice a terrified kobold on a stone altar to a dark god. The kobold is somehow immune to piercing damage and keeps screaming. **
| | **Variation:** The kobold is actually a polymorphed noble, or the cult serves a black dragon who watches from nearby. **Non-Combat:** Disrupting the ceremony (loud noise, attacks, magic) breaks the ritual—”cultists might flee if their leader falls. The kobold, if saved, knows the location of the cult's hidden temple (containing 4d20 gp and dark relics). Sneaking close (DC 14 Stealth) allows ambushing the distracted cultists. |
| **11** | **Giant Crocodile** |
| | A massive crocodile lies submerged in apparently safe-looking water, only its eyes visible. It's patient, waiting for prey to cross. Its teeth are allegedly haunted. **Variation:** The crocodile is enormous (add 20 HP, extra damage), or multiple crocodiles work together (mated pair). **Non-Combat:** Spotting it (DC 15 Perception) allows finding another crossing. Throwing substantial meat (5 days rations) distracts it long enough to cross safely. Its territory can be marked on maps—”the teeth claim is false, but locals pay for that information. |
| **12** | **Black Dragon Wyrmling** |
| | Fetid water bubbles as a black dragon wyrmling emerges from a hollowed stump, acid dripping from its jaws. It's cruel and sadistic, enjoying the fear it causes before attacking. **Variation:** It has charmed or enslaved bullywugs/kobolds who attack alongside it, or it's younger/weaker than usual (reduce HP by 10). **Non-Combat:** Black dragons respect cruelty and strength—”showing you're willing to be as vicious as it is (DC 15 Intimidation, describing horrible acts) might make it wary. Tribute works less well than with other dragons—”it prefers suffering to gold. Escaping into terrain it can't easily follow (deep into sticky mud, underwater, or areas requiring climbing) forces it to give up rather than exhaust itself. |

---

## COASTAL (Tier 1)
**Roll 2d8**

| 2d8 | Encounter Theme |
|-----|-----------------|
| **2** | **Friendly Merfolk** |
| | Beautiful aquatic humanoids surface near the party, curiosity in their eyes. They're peaceful traders who exchange sea treasures for surface goods and warn about dangerous waters ahead. **Variation:** One merfolk is a noble seeking help against sahuagin raiders, or they're fleeing from a sea hag. **Non-Combat:** Trading goods (they love wine, worked metal, surface fruits) earns friendship, maps of safe waters, warnings about reefs/predators, and potentially a conch shell that can summon them once for aid. They can also retrieve sunken objects or scout underwater areas. |
| **3** | **Bronze Dragon Wyrmling** |
| | A young metallic dragon basks on sunny rocks, its bronze scales gleaming. It's curious about surface dwellers and enjoys conversation, riddles, and tests of wit. **Variation:** It's polymorphed into a human sailor and only reveals itself if impressed, or it's being hunted by sahuagin and needs help. **Non-Combat:** Engaging in friendly conversation, sharing stories, or solving its riddles earns its friendship. It might offer advice about coastal dangers, point toward underwater treasures, or grant a scale that provides limited water breathing (1 use, 10 minutes). Good-aligned and genuinely helpful. |
| **4** | **Beached Dolphin** |
| | A dolphin thrashes weakly on the beach, stranded by the tide. It's intelligent and desperate, making pitiful noises. Sea birds circle overhead. **Variation:** The dolphin is actually polymorphed druid, or returning it to water earns the attention of a grateful nereid who grants a boon. **Non-Combat:** Returning it to water (DC 12 Athletics to move it safely) earns potential future aid—”dolphins remember kindness. If polymorphed druid, immediate reward of spell or information. The dolphin might lead to underwater treasure or warn about nearby predators. |
| **5** | **Tide Pools** |
| | Beautiful tide pools dot the rocky shore, filled with colorful fish, anemones, and shells. Steam mephits play in warm pools created by volcanic vents. **Variation:** One pool contains a water weird, or the mephits guard a valuable pearl (worth 50 gp). **Non-Combat:** Playing with the mephits (Performance, Athletics, or engaging with their games) earns goodwill—”they show the party which pool contains oysters with pearls (2d4 pearls worth 10 gp each). The pools can provide fresh shellfish (2 days rations). |
| **6** | **Shipwreck** |
| | The skeletal remains of a merchant vessel jut from the surf, barnacle-covered and weathered. Seabirds nest in its rigging, and fish swim through its hold. **Variation:** The ship is haunted by the ghost of its captain seeking proper burial, or sahuagin use it as a forward operating base. **Non-Combat:** Exploring the wreck (DC 13 Investigation, requires swimming/wading) reveals a sealed captain's chest containing 3d20 gp, a waterlogged map to treasure, and possibly a still-functional magic item. The ghost, if present, just wants its body found and buried (specific grave marker on distant beach). |
| **7** | **Fishing Village** |
| | A small collection of huts built on stilts over the water houses fishermen and their families. They're wary of strangers but not hostile. **Variation:** The village is being extorted by sahuagin or bandits, or a sea hag has been stealing children. **Non-Combat:** Trading goods, sharing news, or buying fish/supplies earns trust. The villagers know all local waters, can provide guides for 5 gp/day, warn about hazards, and might request help with their problem (reward: 50 gp, boat use, or magic fishing net). |
| **8** | **Giant Crabs** |
| | Enormous crabs skitter across tidal rocks, their pincers clacking aggressively. They're territorial but predictable, defending their feeding grounds. **Variation:** One crab is unusually large (double HP), or they've captured someone in their pincers (still alive, calling for help). **Non-Combat:** Waiting for low tide when they retreat (1d4 hours), using loud noises to drive them away, or circling through deeper water (requires swimming) avoids them. Their shells can be harvested for lightweight armor materials. Rescued victims offer rewards. |
| **9** | **Kuo-toa Scouts** |
| | Fish-like humanoids with bulging eyes watch from tide pools, whispering in their strange language. They're insane and unpredictable but not immediately aggressive. **Variation:** They believe one party member is their god incarnate (DC 13 Persuasion to play along), or they're fleeing from their deeper settlement's coup. **Non-Combat:** Showing "divine" power (any magic) convinces them to worship temporarily. They'll provide information about underwater caves, sea creatures, or their settlement's layout. Playing along gains weird offerings (worthless to surface dwellers but 2d20 gp if sold to collectors). |
| **10** | **Sahuagin Raiders** |
| | Shark-men emerge from the surf, tridents ready and sharks circling nearby. They're raiding for slaves and treasure, attacking surface settlements. **Variation:** A sahuagin baron leads them (much tougher), or they're escorting a captured mer-noble. **Non-Combat:** Showing strength and fighting ability (DC 14 Intimidation, display of power) might make them respect the party too much to attack—”they prefer easy prey. Freeing captives earns gratitude and potential allies. The sahuagin carry 3d20 gp in looted treasure. |
| **11** | **Sea Hag's Territory** |
| | The water turns foul and murky. Dead fish float on the surface. A sea hag lurks below, her horrific appearance enough to frighten even brave souls. She's collecting "beautiful things" (by stealing attractive people). **Variation:** She leads a coven with two other hags (much more dangerous), or she's polymorphed as a beautiful drowning victim calling for help. **Non-Combat:** Haggling with her (she loves making deals) might work—”she trades information or passage for beautiful objects, art, or secrets. She can be bribed with gifts worth 50+ gp. Her lair contains treasures from victims (5d20 gp, potentially cursed items). |
| **12** | **Giant Octopus** |
| | Tentacles burst from the water, wrapping around anything grabbable. A giant octopus hunts near a partially sunken tower that it's claimed as a lair. **Variation:** The octopus is intelligent (trained by merfolk or sahuagin), or it guards the tower's submerged entrance to a dungeon. **Non-Combat:** Ink clouds (the octopus flees when seriously hurt) provide escape. Offering fish (10 days rations) distracts it. The tower might contain air pockets with treasure or be a dungeon entrance requiring water breathing to explore. |
| **13** | **Harpies' Cliff** |
| | Haunting songs echo from rocky seaside cliffs. Harpies nest in the heights, their luring melodies compelling creatures to climb and fall to their deaths (DC 11 Wisdom save vs. charm). **Variation:** A harpy matriarch (add 10 HP) leads the flock, or they guard valuable treasure in their aerie. **Non-Combat:** Deafening the party (wax in ears, *silence*) negates the song. Climbing to their nest while they hunt (they have hunting patterns) allows looting without confrontation (4d20 gp in treasures from victims). Showing immunity to their song (successful saves) sometimes makes them flee—”they rely on the song. |
| **14** | **Blue Dragon Wyrmling** |
| | Thunder rumbles from clear skies. A vain blue dragon wyrmling patrols the coastline, claiming the beach as its territory. It's arrogant and territorial but intelligent. **Variation:** It commands a tribe of kobolds who fortify beach caves, or it's unusually aggressive (fighting a rival bronze dragon). **Non-Combat:** Flattery and tribute (gems worth 50+ gp) satisfy its vanity. It might share information about coastal threats, safe harbors, or underwater dangers in exchange for proper respect. Unlike savage whites, it can be negotiated with—”it values intelligence and cunning. |
| **15** | **Pirate Raid** |
| | The skull-and-crossbones flag appears on the horizon. A pirate crew (bandit captain + 2d4 bandits) rows to shore in longboats, looking for plunder and ale. They're ruthless but predictable. **Variation:** A berserker serves as the ship's champion, or a spy (skilled infiltrator) leads them. **Non-Combat:** If the party has a ship, negotiation or shows of strength might work (DC 14 Intimidation or Persuasion). Pirates respect power and profit—”offering information about better targets, sharing ale, or demonstrating combat prowess might turn them friendly or at least neutral. They know all local coastal secrets and smuggling routes. |
| **16** | **Manticore Lair** |
| | A rocky promontory overlooking the sea serves as a manticore's hunting perch. It watches for prey, its tail spikes ready. The beast is intelligent and speaks Common, preferring to negotiate from a position of strength. **Variation:** A mated pair hunts together, or it's been wounded and desperate. **Non-Combat:** Manticores are lawful evil—”they keep deals. Negotiating passage (DC 14 Persuasion, offering food worth 20 gp or information about better hunting grounds) can work. It knows coastal geography intimately and might share for the right price. Its lair contains 3d20 gp from past victims. |

## URBAN (Tier 1)
**Roll 2d10**

| 2d10 | Encounter Theme |
|-----|-----------------|
| **2** | **Helpful Priest** |
| | A kindly acolyte and several priests tend to the sick and poor in a temple district. They offer free healing, sanctuary, and information about the city. **Variation:** They secretly serve a good deity but the city's corrupt government opposes them, or one acolyte is a spy gathering information on travelers. **Non-Combat:** Accepting healing or making donations earns goodwill. The clergy know all city rumors, can provide sanctuary if the party gets in trouble, and might offer quests to help the needy. They can also identify cursed items or provide *lesser restoration* services. |
| **3** | **Street Performer** |
| | A bard with an invisible servant and animated objects performs a one-man-band show in the square, gathering a crowd. He's talented and knows everything happening in the city. **Variation:** He's a retired adventurer with useful magic items, or he's a spy for a thieves' guild. **Non-Combat:** Tipping generously (5+ gp) or joining the performance earns friendship and information. He knows: where to fence goods, which guards are corrupt, gang territories, upcoming events, and juicy rumors. He might offer to join for an adventure or introduce the party to useful contacts. |
| **4** | **Lost Child** |
| | A noble's child, dressed in fine clothes, cries in an alley. They're lost and scared after getting separated from their parents at the market. **Variation:** The child is a disguised imp gathering intelligence, or kidnapping victim being tracked by the thieves who took them. **Non-Combat:** Returning the child safely to their estate earns a 50 gp reward plus a grateful noble family's favor (useful for social encounters). If an imp, detecting it (DC 14 Insight) prevents falling for its ruse. The kidnapping scenario offers a choice: return for reward or follow to the hideout. |
| **5** | **Market Day** |
| | The marketplace bustles with activity—”vendors hawking wares, performers entertaining, pickpockets working crowds. It's colorful chaos. **Variation:** A disguised doppelganger is replacing a merchant, or a guard patrol is shaking down vendors for "protection money." **Non-Combat:** Shopping offers chances to buy supplies at normal prices, gather rumors (every merchant knows something), establish contacts, or notice crimes in progress. A DC 13 Perception check spots pickpockets (confronting them might lead to thieves' guild). The party can also sell loot or buy information (10 gp gets specific rumors). |
| **6** | **Stray Dog Pack** |
| | A group of stray mastiffs corners the party in an alley, not attacking but demanding food. They're hungry, not vicious. **Variation:** The dogs are protecting street children who hide nearby, or they're diseased (Con saves for anyone bitten). **Non-Combat:** Tossing food (any rations) satisfies them. Befriending them (DC 12 Animal Handling) makes them follow the party, potentially useful for tracking or warnings. The street children, if found, know secret passages through the city (sewer routes, rooftop paths). |
| **7** | **Thief Chase** |
| | A spy sprints through the streets, pursued by city guards. She dodges into an alley where the party stands, gasping for breath. She stole food to feed orphans—”or so she claims. **Variation:** She's a thieves' guild member with valuable intelligence, or she actually stole something important from a corrupt official. **Non-Combat:** Hiding her (DC 13 Deception to guards) earns gratitude and a potential ally. She can introduce the party to the thieves' guild, provide information about the city's underworld, or owe a favor. Turning her in earns a 10 gp reward but makes enemies in the guild. |
| **8** | **Goblin Parade** |
| | Goblins wearing a convincing human costume stumble through the streets, trying to blend in. It's not working. They're trying to shop for their boss (a bigger goblin). **Variation:** They're spies for a goblin tribe planning a sewer raid, or they actually have legitimate business (employed by eccentric wizard). **Non-Combat:** Helping them shop or calling out their disguise leads to different outcomes. They might trade information about sewer systems, offer crude maps, or flee in panic (dropping 2d10 gp in coins). Following them leads to their boss or hideout. |
| **9** | **Con Artist** |
| | A charming man runs a barrel-lifting contest in the square, betting 10 gp that contestants can't lift his barrel. The barrel is empty, but he can cast *hold person* (DC 15) to ensure failure. **Variation:** He's part of a larger con ring (pickpockets work the crowd), or he's a former adventurer testing for worthy recruits. **Non-Combat:** Detecting the magic (DC 14 Arcana or Insight) exposes the con. Winning despite cheating earns respect and he might become a useful contact (knows all the cons, scams, and criminals in the city). Exposing him publicly gets city guard attention. |
| **10** | **Cultist Recruitment** |
| | Two cult fanatics approach the party, offering wealth, power, and purpose if they join their organization. They're disturbingly earnest about serving their dark god. **Variation:** They're recruiting for a demon cult (immediate danger), or they serve an evil but lawful deity (organized, less immediately threatening). **Non-Combat:** Pretending interest (DC 14 Deception) gets an invitation to their meeting place (information gathering opportunity). Refusing firmly makes them leave. Attacking draws guard attention. Following them leads to their temple (potential adventure hook). |
| **11** | **Haunted House** |
| | An abandoned building looms over the street. Locals claim it's haunted—”and they're right. Ghosts and shadows lurk within, but so does forgotten treasure. **Variation:** A banshee haunts the upper floors, or the "ghosts" are actually burglars using fear to keep people away. **Non-Combat:** Investigating reveals the building's tragic history. Laying the spirits to rest (proper burial, solving their murder, returning stolen items) grants their blessing and access to hidden treasure (4d20 gp, possibly magic item). Sneaking past the ghosts (DC 15 Stealth) allows looting without confrontation. |
| **12** | **Rat Swarm** |
| | The sewers have erupted—”giant rat swarms pour from drainage grates, fleeing something worse below. They're terrified, not aggressive. **Variation:** Wererats drove them out to cover their own escape, or an otyugh has invaded their territory. **Non-Combat:** The rats flee past if not provoked. Following them into sewers leads to their source of fear (potential adventure). The sewer grates can be sealed (DC 13 Athletics) to stop the flood. City pays 20 gp for solving the rat problem. |
| **13** | **Wererat Warning** |
| | A mousy man in rags sells "yesterday's fish for today's prices" from a cart. He's actually a wererat trying to warn the party about a dangerous area ahead (rival gang, guard trap, etc.). **Variation:** He's trying to lead them into an ambush, or he wants to recruit them for the wererat gang. **Non-Combat:** Recognizing what he is (DC 14 Insight) allows reading his true intentions. If genuinely helpful, he provides accurate information about criminal territories, guard patrol routes, and sewer passages. He might offer to fence stolen goods at 60% value or trade information for disease cures. |
| **14** | **Giant Spider Infestation** |
| | A warehouse district has been infested with giant wolf spiders that emerged from imported cargo. They've webbed several workers to walls and ceilings. **Variation:** An ettercap commands them, or they're protecting egg sacs that will hatch soon. **Non-Combat:** Smoking them out or using fire clears the infestation. The warehouse owner pays 50 gp for elimination. Rescued workers provide information about the cargo's origin. The webs can be harvested (DC 12 Nature, worth 3d20 gp to right buyers). |
| **15** | **Berserker Rampage** |
| | A crazed berserker smashes through the marketplace, eyes glazed and frothing. He's under the influence of a bad batch of alchemical drugs. His friend (bandit) tries to stop him. **Variation:** He's been enchanted by a cult, or he's actually possessed and needs exorcism. **Non-Combat:** Subduing him non-lethally (grappling, *sleep*, calming magic) prevents deaths. His friend explains the drug source (tracking down the dealer is an adventure hook). The city guard arrives in 1d4 rounds—”leaving before then avoids questions. |
| **16** | **Bandit Captain's Ambush** |
| | A charming woman tries to lure one party member down a dark alley with promises of valuable information or romance. She's a bandit captain planning an ambush. **Variation:** She's a succubus (much more dangerous), or she's being coerced by someone worse. **Non-Combat:** Detecting the trap (DC 15 Insight) allows turning it around. Confronting her before the ambush might lead to negotiation—”she might trade information about her employer for letting her escape. The alley contains her gang's stash (3d20 gp). |
| **17** | **Merchant's Problem** |
| | A merchant tries to sell a cursed carpet, claiming it's "haunted" for flavor. It's actually a rug of smothering, and she doesn't know. **Variation:** She knows and is selling it deliberately (criminal), or she's cursed and compelled to sell cursed items. **Non-Combat:** Detecting the curse (DC 13 Arcana) allows warning her (earning gratitude and shopping discounts) or buying it cheap to use against enemies. She knows all legitimate merchants in the city and can provide letters of introduction. |
| **18** | **Talking Statue** |
| | An elven woman statue in the town square suddenly speaks to one party member telepathically: "Kill the others. Live with me forever." **Variation:** It's a trapped succubus, a test by a local wizard, or an actual cursed artifact. **Non-Combat:** Investigating reveals the statue's nature (DC 14 Arcana). It might be destroyed, studied for reward (wizard pays 100 gp for information), or ignored. Succumbing to its influence leads to charmed condition and potential combat with party. Resisting proves mental fortitude. |
| **19** | **Cultist Kidnapping** |
| | Cultists attempt to grab a merchant in broad daylight—”a former member who left the cult two years ago when it was just a social club. They're desperate and poorly organized. **Variation:** The cult serves a powerful demon (much more dangerous), or the merchant is actually a spy who infiltrated them. **Non-Combat:** Intervening scares off the cultists (they're not combat-trained). The merchant explains the cult's growth into something darker, providing information about their location, membership, and goals. The city guard is corrupt and won't help. This becomes an adventure hook. |
| **20** | **Mimic Warehouse** |
| | A treasure-filled warehouse seems too good to be true—”because several chests, doors, and even a barrel are mimics waiting for prey. They've been here for months, patient and hungry. **Variation:** A single large mimic (double HP) dominates, or the warehouse owner is a doppelganger using mimics as guards. **Non-Combat:** Detecting mimics (DC 14 Investigation before touching) allows avoidance or using them as traps against enemies. Real treasures exist among the mimics (5d20 gp in goods). Smoke or specific alchemical mixtures (DC 15 Arcana) drive mimics away. The warehouse's actual owner doesn't know about the infestation and will pay 75 gp for clearing it. |

## USAGE NOTES

### For Dungeon Masters:
1. **Weighted Results**: Lower rolls (2-5) trend toward helpful/neutral encounters. Middle rolls (6-12) offer standard challenges. High rolls (13+) present serious threats.

2. **Inspiration, Not Scripture**: Each entry provides a theme and suggestions—”adapt freely to fit your narrative and party's current situation.

3. **Three-Part Structure**:
    - **Core Scenario**: The basic encounter
    - **Variations**: Ways to adjust difficulty or add complexity
    - **Non-Combat Options**: Alternatives to fighting

4. **Scaling**: These are designed for 5 experienced players at levels 1-4. Adjust creature numbers (not types) for different party sizes.

5. **Environmental Considerations**: Remember terrain impacts combat—”forests have cover and difficult terrain, swamps have visibility issues and disease, etc.

### Quick Reference for Pacing:
- **Low-Stakes Session**: Roll lower dice or reroll high results
- **Dangerous Session**: Roll higher or use variations
- **Mixed Session**: Roll as normal, using results to create rhythm
