*From "So You Want to Be a Game Master"*

## The Standard Reaction Table (2d6)

| 2D6 | REACTION | DESCRIPTION |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| 2-3 | **Immediate Attack** | Hostile on sight. Attacks without warning or negotiation. |
| 4-5 | **Hostile** | Aggressive and unfriendly. May attack if provoked or if PCs appear weak. Demands, threats, insults. |
| 6-8 | **Cautious/Threatening** | Wary and suspicious. Weapons drawn but not attacking yet. May negotiate but from position of distrust. |
| 9-10 | **Neutral** | Indifferent. Neither helpful nor harmful. Open to negotiation but not invested. "Not my problem." |
| 11-12 | **Amiable** | Friendly and helpful. Open to conversation and cooperation. May offer information or aid. |

## When to Use Reaction Checks

### Random Encounters
- Determine attitude of randomly encountered creatures
- Roll when PCs first encounter them
- Reaction may shift based on PC actions

### First Contact with Dungeon Faction
- Unknown creatures/groups in dungeon
- Sets baseline attitude toward PCs
- Can be modified by faction ideology

### NPC Initial Attitudes
- Meeting important NPCs for first time
- Stranger interactions in cities
- Unknown merchants, guards, informants

## Modifications

### Biased Checks

**Friendly Bias (2d6+2):**
- Eliminates Immediate Attack (minimum 4)
- Increases likelihood of positive reactions
- Use for: Generally friendly factions, lawful guards in civilized areas, merchants

**Hostile Bias (2d6-2):**
- Increases likelihood of hostile reactions
- Eliminates Amiable (maximum 10)
- Use for: Known enemy factions, dangerous monsters, rival adventurers

**Extreme Hostile (2d6-4):**
- Almost guaranteed hostile reaction
- Use for: Mortal enemies, creatures that eat humanoids, undead in holy crypt

### Preset Reactions

Instead of rolling, preset reaction based on faction:

**Example Dungeon:**
- Gricks: Immediate Attack (mindless predators)
- Goblins: Hostile (at war with surface dwellers)
- Kobolds: Cautious (curious but defensive)
- Dark Dwarves: Neutral (pragmatic traders)
- Myconids: Amiable (peaceful fungus folk)

### Situational Modifiers

**PC Actions:**
- Approaching openly: +2
- Weapons drawn: -2
- Offering gift: +2
- Killed their allies recently: -4
- Helped their faction before: +4
- Speaking their language: +1
- Magic/divine aura detected: ±2 (depends on creature)

**Context:**
- Creature wounded/cornered: -2
- PCs obviously stronger: +1
- PCs obviously weaker: -1
- Creature guarding something: -2
- Creature seeking help: +2

## Shifting Reactions

Reactions are **starting points**, not locked-in states.

### During the Encounter

**Reactions can improve:**
- Successful Persuasion/Diplomacy check
- Offering valuable information/items
- Proving common enemy
- Demonstrating strength (sometimes)
- Appealing to ideology

**Reactions can worsen:**
- Insults or threats
- Failed Deception attempts
- Attacking their allies
- Violating cultural taboos
- Stealing from them

**Example:**
```
Initial: Cautious (7) - Orcs have weapons ready but haven't attacked
PC: "We're here to kill the necromancer who's been raising your dead"
DM: Make a Persuasion check
PC: [Rolls 18]
DM: Their leader lowers his axe. "Necromancer is our enemy too.
     Maybe we talk." [Shifted to Neutral/Amiable]
```

### Between Encounters

Track faction reactions over time:

**Reputation System:**
- Faction starts at Cautious
- Each positive interaction: +1 modifier to future checks
- Each negative interaction: -1 modifier
- Major help/betrayal: ±2 or more

**Example Tracking:**
```
KOBOLD TRIBE REACTION: Neutral (base)
Modifiers:
+2 (helped rescue their young from goblins)
+1 (traded fairly for supplies)
-1 (accidentally damaged their shrine)
Current: +2 total → Roll 2d6+2 for new encounters
```

## Custom Reaction Tables

Create custom tables for specific situations:

### Faction-Specific Reactions

## Reaction Checks in Different RPG Systems

### D&D 5e

### Old School D&D / OSR
- Strict 2d6 table adherence
- Charisma modifier applies
- Single roll, reactions sticky

### Dungeon World / PbtA
- Use fiction + Parley move
- 10+: Friendly, 7-9: Cautious, 6-: Hostile
- Player-facing rolls

### Other Systems

- Core principle: Quick attitude determination
- Modifiable based on PC actions
