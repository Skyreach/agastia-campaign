# Ratterdan Underground Ecology

**Dungeon:** Ratterdan Shadow Dungeon (Session 1)
**Created By:** Corruption from Giant's Axe
**Threat Level:** Low (Level 1-2 party)
**Status:** Temporary (collapses when corruption source removed)

---

## Overview

The shadow creatures in Ratterdan's underground chambers are not natural inhabitants—they are manifestations spawned by the corruption leaking from the cursed giant's axe. These creatures feed on magical energy and exist in a fragile ecosystem that will collapse once the corruption source (the axe) is cleansed.

## Environment

**Climate:** Unnatural cold despite being underground
**Illumination:** Total darkness with purple corruption glow
**Atmosphere:** Corruption creates visual distortions (inverted heat shimmer effect)

**Physical Features:**
- Rough volcanic rock walls and floors
- Ceiling height varies 6-12 feet
- Stalactites and natural cave formations
- Purple mist leaking from wall fissures
- Shadow-moss growing in patches (difficult terrain)
- Floor rubble from ceiling collapses

**Corruption Effects:**
- Purple mist tendrils creep along surfaces
- Reality warps in zones near corruption veins
- Unnatural cold penetrates clothing
- Shadow-moss dampens sound (advantage on Stealth)
- Fissures leak corruption like open wounds

## Creature Types

### Shadow-Touched Rats (CR 1/8)
**Quantity:** 3-4 in Room 1
**Behavior:** Pack hunters, use ceiling and walls for mobility

**Ecology Role:** Scavengers and first-wave corruption spreaders
- Feed on magical residue from corruption
- Use pack tactics instinctively
- Attack isolated targets
- Flee when reduced to 1 rat (survival instinct)

**Special Adaptations:**
- Climb speed 30ft (use ceiling cracks)
- Pack Tactics (advantage when ally within 5ft)
- Nibble Essence (drain minor abilities on critical hit)
- Darkvision 60ft

**Tactics:**
- Drop attacks from ceiling
- Coordinate with chittering sounds
- Target isolated party members
- Use rubble and shadows for cover
- Flee to Room 2 if overwhelmed

### Shadow Spawn (CR 1/4)
**Quantity:** 2 in Room 2
**Behavior:** Territorial guardians, target spellcasters

**Ecology Role:** Corruption nexus defenders
- Siphon ambient magical energy
- Feed on corruption pools
- Guard path to Heartstone Chamber
- More intelligent than rats (tactical)

**Special Adaptations:**
- Speed 40ft (fast pursuit)
- Shadow Touch attack (necrotic damage)
- Power Drain (steal spell slots/features)
- Shadow Convert (regain HP from drained slots)
- Shadow Stealth (bonus action Hide in dim/dark)
- Sunlight Sensitivity (disadvantage in bright light)

**Tactics:**
- Hide in darkness using Shadow Stealth
- Focus fire on casters/healers (drain spell slots)
- Attack from unexpected angles (walls, ceiling)
- Retreat to walls when bloodied
- Won't pursue far from Room 2 (territorial)
- Use corruption pools for healing

## Food Chain

**Energy Source:** Corruption from giant's axe
↓
**Primary Consumers:** Shadow-Touched Rats (feed on corruption residue)
↓
**Apex Consumers:** Shadow Spawn (feed on magical energy + corruption pools)

**No Natural Predators:** This is an artificial ecosystem
**Collapse Condition:** When corruption source removed, creatures dissipate

## Territorial Behavior

### Room 1: Shadow Rat Den
- **Territory:** Entrance chamber and connecting passages
- **Behavior:** Aggressive to intruders, flee if overwhelmed
- **Nesting:** Rubble piles and ceiling cracks
- **Food Source:** Corruption residue, small creatures from surface

### Room 2: Corruption Nexus
- **Territory:** Central chamber with strong corruption
- **Behavior:** Defensive, won't pursue beyond chamber
- **Purpose:** Guard corruption pools and path to Room 3
- **Food Source:** Corruption pools, magical energy

### Room 3: Heartstone Chamber
- **Territory:** Inner sanctum (no creatures)
- **Behavior:** Shadows circle but don't attack (environmental hazard only)
- **Purpose:** Corruption source (Heartstone being corrupted)
- **Note:** No final guardian this time (environmental challenge instead)

## Reproduction & Lifecycle

**Shadow-Touched Rats:**
- NOT natural reproduction
- Spawn from corruption pools in Room 1
- Can create 1d4 new rats per day if left alone
- Will eventually overflow into surface if unchecked

**Shadow Spawn:**
- Spawn from corruption nexus in Room 2
- 1 new spawn every 2-3 days
- Cap at 4 spawn (Room 2 corruption capacity limit)
- More dangerous than rats but spawn slower

**Lifecycle if Unchecked:**
- Week 1: Current population (3-4 rats, 2 spawn)
- Week 2: 8-12 rats, 3 spawn
- Week 3: 15-20 rats, 4 spawn, rats spill to surface
- Week 4: 25+ rats, 4 spawn, surface attacks begin

**Collapse Upon Cleansing:**
- When Heartstone activates and breaks corruption
- Shadow creatures dissipate immediately (no corpses)
- Corruption pools dry up
- Purple mist fades
- Dungeon becomes inert cave system

## Environmental Hazards

### Corruption Pools
- Difficult terrain
- Can be ignited with fire (1d6 fire/round)
- Feed shadow spawn (destroy for 1d6 damage to nearest spawn)
- Radiant damage most effective

### Unstable Stalactites
- Can be dropped on creatures (Athletics/DEX attack +5, 2d6 damage, 10ft radius)
- Perception DC 12 to spot loose ones
- Environmental weapons

### Distortion Zones
- Corruption warps space visually
- Can be triggered to disorient creatures (Arcana DC 13)
- Causes disadvantage on attacks for 1 round

### Corruption Veins
- Purple veins run from Heartstone through floor to surface
- Connect to giant's axe above
- Touching deals 1d4 psychic damage
- Show corruption flow direction

### Unstable Rubble
- Weight triggers collapse (STR save DC 11 or 2d6 bludgeoning)
- Creates difficult terrain
- Can reveal hidden passages if collapsed strategically

## Creature Interactions

**Rats ↔ Spawn:**
- NOT cooperative (different species)
- Rats flee through Room 2 if overwhelmed (spawn don't stop them)
- Spawn ignore rats unless provoked
- Both spawn from same corruption source but separate

**Creatures ↔ Environment:**
- Shadow creatures immune to corruption effects
- Use darkness and shadows for advantage
- Feed on corruption to sustain themselves
- Will defend corruption pools if attacked

**Creatures ↔ Party:**
- Drawn to living creatures (food/energy source)
- Target magical abilities specifically (drain for sustenance)
- Not intelligent enough to negotiate
- Pure corruption-driven behavior

## Dungeon Collapse Scenario

**When Heartstone Activates:**
1. Tremendous pulse of energy travels upward
2. Corruption veins shatter
3. Shadow creatures dissipate instantly (poof, no bodies)
4. Purple glow fades
5. Temperature returns to normal
6. Corruption pools evaporate
7. Shadow-moss withers

**After Collapse:**
- Dungeon becomes normal cave system
- Safe to explore (no longer dangerous)
- Rubble remains (structural changes permanent)
- Heartstone either taken by party or left dormant

## DM Notes

### Using This Ecology

**For Tension:**
- Describe corruption spawning creatures (pulsing from pools)
- Show rats coordinating (intelligent pack behavior)
- Emphasize spawn targeting casters (resource drain threat)

**For Strategy:**
- Let party discover environmental weapons
- Reward tactical thinking (drop stalactites, ignite pools)
- Secret passage allows bypassing Room 2 entirely

**For Horror:**
- Describe corruption as living, pulsing
- Shadow creatures flicker between solid and smoke
- Cold that penetrates bone
- Unnatural silence broken by chittering

### Creature Scaling

**If Party Struggles:**
- Reduce rat HP to 5 (from 7)
- Reduce spawn HP to 7 (from 9)
- Rats flee after 2 killed (instead of 1 remaining)

**If Party Breezes Through:**
- Add 1-2 more rats
- Spawn use environment more tactically
- Add 1 more spawn in Room 2

### Educational Value

This dungeon teaches:
1. **Resource Management:** Power Drain forces conservation
2. **Environmental Tactics:** Using hazards as weapons
3. **Pack Tactics:** How coordinated enemies fight
4. **Exploration:** Secret passage rewards investigation
5. **Consequences:** Corruption spreads if ignored

## Future Hooks

**If Party Doesn't Clear:**
- Shadow creatures spill to surface
- Ratterdan becomes more dangerous
- Corruption spreads to nearby areas
- Merit Council may investigate

**If Party Clears:**
- Ratterdan stabilizes
- Cave system could be repurposed
- Party gains reputation as corruption-clearers
- Other corruption sites might need attention

**Research Value:**
- Scholars interested in corruption mechanics
- Shadow creature remains (if preserved somehow)
- Corruption samples for study
- Heartstone itself (if taken)
