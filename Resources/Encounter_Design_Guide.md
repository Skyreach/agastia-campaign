# Resource-Draining Encounter Design Guide

## Core Philosophy
Encounters should challenge party resources (spell slots, abilities, hit dice) more than just hit points. This creates tension throughout the adventuring day and makes resource management meaningful.

## Encounter Difficulty by Level

### Level 1-2 (Current Party Level)
- **Easy:** 250 XP (5 players)
- **Medium:** 500 XP
- **Hard:** 750 XP
- **Deadly:** 1000 XP

### Adventuring Day XP Budget
- **Level 2 Party (5 players):** 3,000 XP per day
- Aim for 6-8 encounters of varying difficulty
- Not all encounters need to be combat

## Resource Draining Mechanics

### Targeting Spell Slots
- **Counterspell/Dispel Magic:** Force casters to use slots defensively
- **Silence Zones:** Require repositioning or non-verbal solutions
- **Antimagic Fields:** Temporary zones that suppress magic
- **Multiple Encounters:** No long rests between fights
- **Ritual Interruption:** Prevent ritual casting to save slots

### Targeting Hit Dice
- **Environmental Damage:** Ongoing effects between combats
- **Disease/Poison:** Conditions that persist after combat
- **Exhaustion:** Stacking exhaustion levels
- **Curses:** Effects requiring restoration magic
- **Traps Between Fights:** Damage that can't be avoided

### Targeting Class Abilities
- **Multiple Saves:** Force use of abilities like Indomitable
- **Spread Enemies:** Make Channel Divinity less effective
- **Grapples/Restraints:** Force use of misty step, rage, etc.
- **Time Pressure:** Limit short rests to recover abilities
- **Ability Checks:** Drain Bardic Inspiration, Guidance

## Encounter Types

### Combat Encounters
**Design Principles:**
- Use terrain to advantage
- Include environmental hazards
- Mix enemy types (ranged, melee, caster)
- Add objectives beyond "kill everything"
- Include innocent bystanders or complications

**Resource Drain Focus:**
- Wave battles (reinforcements arrive)
- Hit-and-run tactics (enemies retreat and return)
- Casters with counterspell/dispel
- Enemies that force saving throws
- Regenerating enemies

### Environmental Challenges
**Design Principles:**
- Multiple solutions possible
- Failure doesn't mean death
- Time pressure adds tension
- Progressive difficulty

**Examples:**
- Collapsing dungeon (DEX saves + exhaustion)
- Extreme weather (CON saves + exhaustion)
- Magical storms (random effects)
- Difficult terrain requiring resources

### Social Encounters
**Design Principles:**
- Stakes beyond party reputation
- Multiple NPCs with different agendas
- Time-sensitive negotiations
- Information as currency

**Resource Costs:**
- Spells for advantage (Charm Person, Zone of Truth)
- Bribes and gifts (gold/items)
- Promises and favors (future complications)
- Class abilities (Bardic Inspiration, Divine Sense)

### Trap/Puzzle Encounters
**Design Principles:**
- Telegraphed but not obvious
- Multiple stages
- Resource cost for bypassing
- Reward clever solutions

**Resource Drains:**
- Damage over time (acid, poison)
- Spell slots to solve (Dispel Magic, Knock)
- Exhaustion from physical challenges
- Time pressure preventing rest

## Pacing the Adventuring Day

### Structure
1. **Opening:** Easy encounter to warm up (15% resources)
2. **Rising Action:** 2-3 medium encounters (40% resources)
3. **Climax:** Hard encounter (25% resources)
4. **Complications:** Environmental/social challenges (15% resources)
5. **Resolution:** Final easy-medium encounter (5% resources)

### Short Rest Management
- Allow 2-3 short rests maximum
- Make rests risky (wandering monsters)
- Time pressure limits resting
- Environmental factors (too dangerous to rest)

### Long Rest Interruption
- Night ambushes
- Environmental hazards
- Time-sensitive missions
- Unsafe resting locations

## Failure Scenarios

### Sensory Descriptions for Resource Depletion
**No Spell Slots:**
"The arcane energies that usually flow through you feel sluggish and unresponsive. Each attempt to grasp the Weave leaves you mentally exhausted, like trying to lift weights with a strained muscle."

**No Hit Dice:**
"Every wound throbs with deep, bone-deep weariness. Your body has nothing left to give - even catching your breath doesn't ease the pervasive exhaustion."

**Exhaustion Levels:**
- **Level 1:** "Your movements feel slightly sluggish, like wading through water."
- **Level 2:** "Each step requires conscious effort. Your reactions are noticeably slower."
- **Level 3:** "Your limbs feel like lead. Even thinking clearly requires effort."

**Failed Saves:**
"Your mind reels as the effect takes hold. For a terrifying moment, you lose all sense of self, drowning in magical compulsion."

## Monster Modifications for Resource Drain

### Simple Templates

**Spell Thief (+1 CR)**
- Reaction: When hit by a spell, absorb one spell slot
- Stolen slots fuel special abilities

**Exhausting (+0.5 CR)**
- Attacks cause CON save DC 12 or gain exhaustion
- Maximum one level per combat

**Ability Drainer (+0.5 CR)**
- On hit: Target loses one use of lowest available ability
- Returns on short rest

**Persistent (+1 CR)**
- Regeneration 5 HP per round
- Must use fire/acid or specific damage type

## Encounter Building Checklist

- [ ] Calculate XP budget for intended difficulty
- [ ] Choose primary resource to target
- [ ] Add environmental factors or complications
- [ ] Include multiple solution paths
- [ ] Prepare failure consequences (not TPK)
- [ ] Write sensory descriptions for resource loss
- [ ] Consider party composition and abilities
- [ ] Plan enemy tactics to drain resources
- [ ] Set up time pressure or rest limitations
- [ ] Create meaningful stakes beyond survival

## Campaign Integration

### Session 1 Considerations
- Party is fresh (full resources)
- Establish resource management importance
- Telegraph that not every fight needs to be won
- Reward creative resource conservation
- Multiple encounters before long rest

### Scaling Difficulty
- Start with single resource focus
- Gradually introduce mixed resource drains
- Increase complexity as party gains levels
- Track which resources players struggle to manage
- Adjust encounter design based on party tactics

## DM Quick Reference

### Signs Party Has Too Many Resources:
- Never use Hit Dice
- Spam highest level spells
- No tension in exploration
- Rest after every encounter
- Never retreat or negotiate

### Signs Party is Too Drained:
- Multiple unconscious PCs
- No abilities left by encounter 3
- Constant requests for rests
- Avoiding all encounters
- Extreme risk aversion

### Adjustment Dials:
- **Easier:** Add healing potions, safe rest spots, reduce enemies
- **Harder:** Add reinforcements, time pressure, environmental damage
- **Different:** Change resource focus, add non-combat solutions
