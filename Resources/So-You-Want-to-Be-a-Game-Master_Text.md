INTRODUCTION

YOU HAVE CHOSEN to enter a world of heroic adventure. More

importantly, you have taken your first step toward unlocking those
adventures for your friends. Unlike books, movies, or other types of
games, a roleplaying game (RPG) offers infinite adventures, limited
only by the power of your imagination. And because it’s a game of
imagination, it can be played almost anywhere. Most games are
played around a table, but you can just as easily play via a video
call, email, or special programs called virtual tabletops (VTTs).
One member of the group—the one this book is about and whom
you’ve chosen to become—is the game master (GM). In Dungeons &
Dragons, one of the most popular roleplaying games, the GM is
known as the dungeon master (DM). As the DM, you’ll be
responsible for describing the fantasy world in which the game takes
place:
As you come around the corner, you see that the corridor comes to a
dead end. Carved in bas-relief upon this wall is a giant face—a face
larger than you are tall. As your gaze alights upon it, the face begins
to move. Its granite lips form words—words that thunder down the
corridor. “WHO DARES TO TRESPASS HERE?”
The other players can now tell you what they’re going to do: Will
they talk to the face? Try to destroy it? Cast a spell to silence it? Or
will they try something completely different? The decision is up to
them!
But the players don’t need to play as themselves. Instead, they’ll
create the role of a fantasy hero and step into their shoes. Perhaps
they’d like to play as a heroic knight pursuing quests of honor. Or as
an enigmatic wizard seeking the lost secrets of the cosmos. Or as an

ancient elf hoping that the companionship of the younger races will
help him to recover the youth he lost centuries ago. In a roleplaying
game, you can pretend to be anyone you want!
Playing an RPG is a little like performing in an improvised radio
drama. It’s as if you were acting in a play or movie, but there’s no
script and the wonders of your adventure are not limited by even
the most extravagant of special effects budgets.
Anything you can imagine is possible in a roleplaying game.
But an RPG isn’t just Make-Believe or Let’s Pretend. It’s also a
game. The players’ characters will face challenges—monsters, traps,
and the like—and their success is not assured. By rolling dice and
following the rules of the game, you’ll be able to determine the
success or failure of your characters’ actions. In other words, the
players will tell you (the DM) what they want their characters to do,
and you’ll use the rules (and your own creativity!) to figure out
what the result is.

INTO THE DUNGEON

For many of you reading this, nothing I’ve written here will have
come as a surprise. You’ve either played a roleplaying game before
or read a similar introduction in a rulebook or watched an actual
play video featuring other people playing the game. That’s why you
picked up this book in the first place. In fact, you may have already
run your first adventure as a DM and are trying to figure out how
you can do it better.
But whether you’re taking your first steps or taking your game to
the next level, let’s take a peek at an example of what actually
playing a roleplaying game looks like, how that relates to what
you’ll be doing as a DM, and how this book is going to help you do
that.
Jason is serving as the DM for a group of three players. Seth is
playing Ranthir, a young apprentice wizard with an endless thirst
for knowledge and a penchant for carrying a dozen different bags
and satchels packed full of various useful odds and ends. Sarah is

playing Tithenmamiwen (Tee), an elven maid rebelling against
her elders. Dave is playing Agnarr, a brash barbarian who has
little regard for the cares or concerns of the civilized world.
The group, also commonly referred to as a “party,” are currently
exploring an underground labyrinth once occupied by the Sons of
Jade—a group of scholars, loremasters, and magi who sought to
unlock the secrets of the ancient and powerful Jade Magi of the
Lost City of Shandrala.
JASON (DM): As you emerge through the rubble of the broken
wall, you see a large room of cream-colored stone. There are
three doors leading out of the room—a tall door of bluish steel
directly across from you and two smaller ones off to either side.
In the corner of the chamber, a huge mass of debris has been
piled high.
Jason is running a dungeon scenario, in which the players’
characters (PCs) have descended into an underground vault filled
with dangers to overcome and treasure to win. We’ll be looking at
how to run and create your own dungeons in Part 1, starting on
page 21.
SARAH (TEE): I’ll go check out the door of blue steel.

DAVE (AGNARR): I’ll go dig through the garbage.
SARAH (TEE): There’s no pile of filth too large or too small for
Agnarr.
JASON (DM): (laughing) OK, Agnarr starts digging through the
trash. Tee, the door is locked.
SETH (RANTHIR): Does it look like that last door of blue steel we
found?

JASON (DM): Virtually identical.
SARAH (Tee): Well, I won’t be able to pick the lock then. We’ll
need the password.

A roleplaying game is a conversation. You’ll describe what the PCs
see, the players will respond by telling you what their characters
do in response or by asking questions to clarify their
understanding of the situation, and then you’ll respond to them.
It’s a loop, right? Your topic of conversation is the fictional world
of the game, and you’ll build that world—and the things that
happen in it—by actively engaging with that conversation. You’ll
listen to each other. You’ll build on each other’s ideas. You may
even get emotional or interrupt or disagree with each other, just
like any other conversation.
DAVE (AGNARR): I hate those doors. (to Jason) Have I found
anything in the trash pile yet?
JASON (DM): Looks like a lot of glass and metal. Small stuff.
SETH (RANTHIR): Anything interesting?
JASON (DM): Give me an Intelligence (Arcana) check.
SETH (RANTHIR): (rolls some dice) 13.

JASON (DM): There’s a bunch of alchemical equipment. You think
it might be the remains of a rather large laboratory. Agnarr’s
smashing a lot of it, but it doesn’t look like it was worth much
to begin with.
SETH (RANTHIR): Carry on.

The character is attempting an action and the DM isn’t certain of
the outcome, so he calls for a skill check, using the mechanics of
the game to determine the outcome. The player rolls a 20-sided
die, then adds their Intelligence modifier and, because they’re
proficient in the Arcana skill, their proficiency bonus. The result is
13, which the DM compares to the difficulty of the action.
Because the check was equal to or higher than the difficulty,
Ranthir succeeded in identifying the alchemical equipment.
This is called a ruling: As the DM, you are figuring out how the
rules of the game can be used to determine what happens in the
game world. This is more or less the most basic skill of being a

DM: When the player says, “I want to do X,” how do you
respond? We’ll break this skill down into a simple procedure,
starting on page 24.
JASON (DM): As you shove aside a particularly large mass of
debris, you reveal the corpse of a dead goblin. The sickly sweet
smell of decay washes over you in a thick wave. What are you
all doing?
SARAH (TEE): Tee doesn’t even look. She wants no part of
whatever’s making that smell. She’s going to head over to the
door on the left and see if she can get that open.
DAVE (AGNARR): I’ll keep digging!
SARAH (TEE): Of course you will …

JASON (DM): There are a couple more goblin corpses after the
first.
SETH (RANTHIR): How long have they been dead? (rolls some
dice) I got a 17 on my Wisdom (Medicine) check.

Wisdom is a different ability score from Intelligence, and
Medicine is a different skill from Arcana. Different characters will
have different ability scores and be proficient in different skills.
Figuring out which mechanics to use is an important part of making a
good ruling.
JASON (DM): Hard to say for certain. Probably at least a couple of
weeks. They’re pretty badly decomposed.

SETH (RANTHIR): okay. I guess I’ll keep an eye out over Agnarr’s
shoulder. If he comes across anything valuable, I’ll try to stop
him before he destroys it.

JASON (DM): A couple layers down from the corpses, Agnarr
suddenly unearths a perfectly preserved box of cherry wood
with a mosaic design of inlaid jade. It seems to be completely
unmarred—a stark contrast to the broken junk around it.
SETH (RANTHIR): I cast detect magic.

Detect magic is the name of a magical spell. Some characters,
including wizards like Ranthir, are capable of casting powerful
dweomers. This spell allows Ranthir to detect the presence of
other magical effects.
JASON (DM): (to Sarah) Tee finds the door unlocked.

SARAH (TEE): I’ll open it.
JASON (DM): (to Ranthir) As soon as your spell comes into effect,
you can see a faint magical aura around the box.
SETH (RANTHIR): (to Dave) May I please see that, Master Agnarr?
DAVE (AGNARR): (with a shrug) Sure. I hand it over.
SETH (RANTHIR): I’ll try to open the box.

JASON (DM): (to Seth) You open the box to find a perfectly
preserved pack of love letters. They appear to have been written
by a woman named Athara and are addressed to a man named
Oliss. (to Sarah) The door swings open with a loud, rusty creak.
The narrow hall beyond the door is choked with thick, ropelike
webs. The webs nearest to the door have been hacked apart and
hang forlornly from the walls in tattered wisps. About 15 feet
away, you can see another hall intersecting this one. At the
intersection, the hacking of the webs comes to an end and you
can see that the corpses of two large spiders—spiders nearly the
size of a small cow—lie belly-up on the floor there.
A dungeon adventure is divided into separate rooms. Everything up
until this point has taken place in one room, and Jason has
known what’s in that room—for example, what’s hidden inside
the pile of garbage—by looking at his notes for that room. We
call those notes the room key. Now Sarah has opened a door
and is looking into another room, so Jason flips through his notes
to the key for that room and can describe what Sarah sees there.
Knowing how to create, read, and run a room key is, of course, a
fundamental part of running a successful dungeon adventure.

See here for more information on running a room.
SARAH (TEE): Uh, guys, I think you should come over here and
look at this. (to Jason) Do I see anything unusual about the
spider corpses?
JASON (DM): Give me a Perception check.
SETH (RANTHIR): I’ll close the box and head over to Tee.

SARAH (TEE): (rolls some dice) Awesome! Natural 20 for a total of
28.
JASON (DM): At first everything seems okay. But then one of the
corpses starts to twitch.
SARAH (TEE): That’s bad.

JASON (DM): Actually, you’re pretty sure it’s not the corpse itself.
Something on the corpse—or inside it?—is crawling and
squirming around.
SARAH (TEE): That’s very, very bad.
SETH (RANTHIR): (pretending he doesn’t know what only Tee can
see) What’s wrong?

SARAH (TEE): Something very, very bad! (to Jason) I slam the
door shut.

JASON (DM): As you reach for the door you see five smaller
spiders—these are only about the size of a large dog—burst out
of the larger corpses and start skittering toward you.
SARAH (TEE): I SLAM THE DOOR SHUT!

JASON (DM): You slam the door shut. I need initiative checks.
SARAH (TEE): (rolls some dice) 7.

DAVE (AGNARR): (rolls some dice) 16.

SETH (RANTHIR): (rolls some dice) 10.
In D&D there’s a special set of rules used to resolve combat. When
combat starts, every character—including the giant spiders being

controlled by the DM—rolls for initiative. The highest initiative
result goes first, followed by the second highest, and so forth.
By forcing everyone to take turns, the conversation during combat
becomes more formal. This will help you (and the players!) keep
track of a situation that might otherwise be hopelessly complex.
On page 486, we’ll dive into techniques that can make running
combat even more fun, and we’ll also find other situations in
which a more formal structure will help you run the game.
JASON (DM): (rolling dice for the spiders) Okay, Agnarr, you’re
first.
DAVE (AGNARR): I throw my shoulder against the door to hold it
shut. I’ve got oil! Anyone got a fire?

SARAH (TEE): Uh … You’ve got your flaming sword.
DAVE (AGNARR): Oh. Right. Well, I don’t think I can open the
door, throw the oil, and light it before the spiders get through.
SARAH (TEE): Throw the oil over here. (to Jason) Can we have
him yank the door open while I throw the flask, and then he
can hit it with his sword in midair?
JASON (DM): Sure.

DAVE (AGNARR): Awesome. Okay, I toss my flask of oil to Tee
and get ready to open the door. FOR THE GLORY!

JASON (DM): All right. As Agnarr shouts the command word for
his sword, it bursts into flame. He yanks open the door as Tee
throws the oil. The flaming greatsword sweeps through the air,
shattering the flask and sending a cascade of burning oil over
the bustling mass of spiders just inside the door. Not only the
oil but also the thick, dry webs burst into flame. (rolls some dice)
Two of the spiders—on fire—come bursting out of the
conflagration. One crawls up Agnarr’s leg and buries its fangs
into his thigh.
DAVE (AGNARR): Get it off! Get it off!

JASON (DM): (rolls some dice) You take 4 points of damage. And
I’ll need a Constitution saving throw.
Characters have hit points (HP), which represent their vitality.
When a character takes damage, they lose hit points. When a
character runs out of hit points, they fall unconscious and may
die.
DAVE (AGNARR): (rolls some dice) 18.

JASON (DM): Okay, you can feel the acidic burn of the spider’s
venom, but you manage to shake it loose before it can deliver a
full dose. It falls back to the floor at Agnarr’s feet. (to Seth) The
other spider is scuttling straight toward Ranthir. What do you
do?
SETH (RANTHIR): I cast magic missile. (rolls some dice) 3,4, and 5
points of damage.

JASON (DM): Three blasts of eldritch force lance out from
Ranthir’s fingertips, striking the spider mid-scuttle. It gives a
high-pitched screech as it collapses into a small, smoldering
ball. (to Dave) It’s Agnarr’s turn again.
DAVE (AGNARR): With a howl of rage, Agnarr smites the little
bastard. (rolls some dice) 16 to hit.

JASON (DM): The spider, shaken free from Agnarr’s leg, is still
skidding across the floor as Agnarr’s greatsword smashes down
on it. Give me damage.
DAVE (AGNARR): (rolls some dice) 14 points of damage plus 3 fire
damage.
JASON (DM): Agnarr’s sword cleaves the spider in twain. A great
gout of greenish ichor geysers into the air.
SARAH (TEE): Are there any other spiders moving in the hallway?
JASON (DM): No. It looks like the flaming oil killed them. But the
fire back there is getting quite intense. It’s being fueled by the
thick webs …

SARAH (TEE): I close the door. I say we just wait for it to burn
out.
DAVE (AGNARR): Sounds good to me.

SARAH (TEE): Should we try the other door?

SETH (RANTHIR): Actually I’ve got an idea, (to Jason) I take out
the packet of love letters we found. I’m going to stand in front
of the door of blue steel and start reading them out loud.
JASON (DM): Umm … okay.

SARAH (TEE): What are you doing?

SETH (RANTHIR): If the door of blue steel has a password, then it
must have been known to the Sons of Jade when they worked
here. And if these letters were written at the same time, the
password might be mentioned.
JASON (DM): (rolls some dice) How long are you going to keep
reading?
SETH (RANTHIR): Until I’ve finished the letters.

JASON (DM): After 22 minutes of reading, Ranthir begins a new
letter: “I am sorry I have not written to you sooner, but the old
taskmaster has been working us hard again. Athvor Krassek may
think himself to be …” But he trails off. At the name of “Athvor
Krassek,” the door of blue steel begins to swing open …

ACTIVE FLAY

One of the coolest things about a roleplaying game—and you can
see it happening in this example of play—is that nobody knows
what’s going to happen until it happens.
If Jason were writing a story for someone else to read, obviously
he’d be in complete control. He’d know that A would happen and
then B would happen and then C would happen. But Jason isn’t an
author writing a story. He’s a dungeon master playing the game
with his friends.

So the players, for example, don’t know that there are spider
hatchlings hiding inside the mother’s corpse (ick!). Jason does,
because he created the scenario and plays the nonplayer characters
(NPCs), but he doesn’t know that the players’ characters are going
to light the corridor on fire.
Similarly, Jason knows that the password for the blue steel door is
“Athvor Krassek,” a former administrator of the laboratory, but he
wasn’t anticipating Ranthir’s player deciding to read the love letters
in front of the door. Does the name “Athvor Krassek” even appear in
those letters? Jason doesn’t know that, either, so he decides to roll
some dice to figure it out.
Moments like these are created through active play: The players
are actively playing their characters. In response, the DM is actively
playing all the other characters, and is also constantly putting toys
into the fictional world—the love letters, the door, the discarded
alchemy equipment—that everyone gets to play with.
Active play is the fundamental principle of a roleplaying game.
And the secret to being a great dungeon master ultimately boils
down to (a) prepping cool toys for you and your players and then
(b) playing with them freely and creatively together.
Everything else is just a matter of technique.

TAKING YOUR FIRST STEPS

This book isn’t a roleplaying game. It won’t teach you the rules. If
you want to play Dungeons & Dragons, you’ll want to pick up either
the D&D Starter Set (for a quick, playable introduction) or the three
rulebooks that contain the full game (the Player’s Handbook,
Dungeon Master’s Guide, and Monster Manual). In fact, from this point
forward I’ll be assuming that you’re familiar with the rules of D&D.
The rulebooks will teach you how to play, but you want to do
more than that. You want to be a dungeon master. You want to
create adventures and entire worlds to share with your players. You
want to invite them into the wondrous vistas you’ve imagined and

forge unforgettable stories with them. But where do you even
begin?
Just turn the page.
Imagining an entire universe may feel daunting right now, but
we’re going to break this down step by step. Starting in the
dungeon, we’ll walk through running an adventure. That’ll go a lot
faster than you might think. You could be DMing your first game
tomorrow if you wanted to!
After that, you’ll design an adventure for the first time and run
that, too. You’ll be amazed at just how simple it can be! We’ll build
on that foundation to make your adventures more dynamic and
exciting, and then you’ll be ready to choose new types of adventures
to explore—heists, mysteries, conspiracies, and more.
OTHER ROLEPLAYING GAMES
Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) is a fantasy RPG set in a world
inspired by the works of authors like J. R. R. Tolkien, N. K.
Jemisin, George R. R. Martin, and Robert E. Howard. But there
are many other RPGs! If you enjoy cyberpunk stories, you
might check out Cyberpunk RED or Technoir. Like horror
movies? Check out Unknown Armies or Call of Cthulhu®. You can
also find licensed RPGs based directly on fictional universes
you already love, like Star Wars, A Song of Ice and Fire, Alien, or
Doctor Who.
For the sake of simplicity, the examples in the first section of
this book are going to assume that you’re playing the current
edition of Dungeons & Dragons. But the vast majority of the
book—and the skills you’ll learn—will be useful no matter what
RPG you’ve chosen to master.

DUNGEONS & DRAGONS was born in the dungeon, with Dave

Arneson—the creator of the modern roleplaying game—carving out
the labyrinths beneath Castle Blackmoor and giving his players the
opportunity to delve down into its depths.
As a new dungeon master, you’re going to start your adventures
in the dungeon, too. The classic dungeon is an underground
complex; a maze of corridors linking rooms filled with monsters,
traps, and treasure. The heroes in a dungeon adventure enter the
maze, defeat the monsters, avoid the traps, and claim the treasure
for themselves. (Or maybe they’ll flip the script, ally with the
monsters, and donate the treasure to the local orphanage. You never
really know what will happen during play!)
A dungeon scenario—the adventure that you’ll be running for
your players—is presented in two parts: the dungeon map and the
dungeon key.
A dungeon map will look something like this:

On the map you can see the various rooms that make up the
dungeon, and each room has been labeled with a number. In the
dungeon key, each numbered room has been given a full
description, telling you everything you need to know when the PCs
enter that room.
Imagine that you’re sitting at a table with your friends and
running a dungeon scenario. The PCs are currently standing in one
of the rooms of the dungeon, so you look at the dungeon key for
that room and describe to the players what their characters see. The
players will respond by telling you what they want their characters
to do in that room, and you’ll tell them what happens as a result.
(Think about Agnarr rooting through the garbage pile or Ranthir
reading through the love letters.) When the players have done
everything they want to do in that room, they’ll be able to choose
one of the exits from that room—a doorway, an archway, a hallway,
a secret passage—and go to a new room, which you can then look
up in the dungeon key and describe to them.
And that’s it. You just keep repeating that loop—describe the
room, resolve the players’ actions, go to the next room, describe the
room—until the adventure is done. It’s very simple. It’s also very
straightforward for the players because they’ll never be left
wondering what they should be doing next: Either there’ll be
something in the current room that they want to do, or they can
always pick an exit and go to the next room.
To get ready for running your first dungeon, we’re going to break
the dungeon loop into two parts and look at each of them
separately. First, how you resolve the actions declared by the
players, a process that we call a ruling. Second, how the dungeon
key works and how you can use it to describe and run each room.
ROLLING DICE
Roleplaying games often refer to dice using an XdY notation,
which means that you roll X number of Y-sided dice and add
the results together. For example, 3d4 means that you should

roll three four-sided dice and 3d6 - 2 means that you should
roll three six-sided dice and then subtract two from the result.

STEP 1: THE RULING
If playing an RPG is a conversation between you and your friends,
then the most basic element of that conversation is the ruling. After
you’ve described what’s going on in the game world and a player
responds by saying that they want their character to do something,
what happens next? As the DM, that’s what you get to figure out
and create!
Once you do figure it out, of course, you’ll describe the outcome
to your players. Hearing this updated version of what’s going on in
the game world will prompt one or more of them to say what the
next thing they want to do is. At which point, of course, you’ll make
another ruling. Which will prompt a response that will prompt a
ruling, which will prompt a response, and so on.
It’s easy to see that, although a lot of other stuff may happen
while you’re playing an RPG, this ruling-response cycle really forms
the core of your conversation; it’s the backbone of everything that
happens during the game. This also means that making good rulings
is the most basic skill you’ll want as a DM.
For example, players might say things like:
“I want to jump over the chasm.”
“I open the door.”

“I’m going to the library to research parasite demons.”
“I attack the orc with my sword!”

“I’m pulling out my thieves’ tools. Let’s see if I can pick this lock.”
Take a moment and think about each of those declarations. You’re
limited because we don’t really have the full context in which these
declarations are being made—how wide is the chasm? what type of
door is it? who are the characters involved?, etc.—but let whatever
first pops into your head roll around for a bit. What would be your
response to each declaration? Why? Can you imagine a different
response to the same declaration?
You might find this exercise easy. (But, no, really. Actually stop
reading, take a minute, and do it.) You might find it difficult. You
might find it easy for some declarations and tricky for others. Either
way, though, I’m pretty sure you were able to come up with a
response for every one of these declarations.
So the first thing to take away from this exercise is that rulings
are something you can already do. They’re not an arcane ritual and
they don’t require special skills. They’re a basic act of creativity and
your imagination has just proven itself equal to the task.
What we do want to do, though, is to make our rulings easier,
faster, and more reliable. Since we’re playing a game, we’ll also
want to integrate our rulings with the game mechanics.
There’s a fairly basic procedure you can follow for this, and it
starts by defaulting to yes.

DEFAULT TO YES

The easiest ruling for a DM to make is “No.”
PLAYER: I want to jump over the chasm.
DM: You can’t.

PLAYER: I’m going to the library to research parasite demons.
DM: You don’t find any information.

PLAYER: I attack the orc with my sword!

DM: You miss.
When you use “No,” everything is simple: There are no
complications. No consequences. You don’t have to create anything.
But that’s exactly why you almost never want to use it. “No”
stagnates the action. It leaves the situation unchanged. Instead of
giving the players a new situation they can react to, you’re instead
asking them to come up with a new reaction to the same situation.
What you want to do is almost exactly the opposite: Default to
yes.
PLAYER: I want to jump over the chasm.
DM: Okay, you’re on the other side.

PLAYER: I’m going to the library to research parasite demons.

DM: You find a book of lore written by a scholar named Sagrathea.
He reports that parasite demons can be revealed by splashing
holy water on their host.
PLAYER: I attack the orc with my sword!

DM: You mercilessly stab the orc. With a shocked look in her eyes,
she slumps to the floor in front of you.
“Yes” moves the action forward. It creates a new situation that
both you and the players will now be forced to respond to. Now that
they’re on the other side of the chasm, what will they do? Where are
they going to find a supply of holy water? How are they going to
hide the orc’s corpse?
At a more basic level, defaulting to yes also makes sense because
people mostly succeed at the stuff they do. Walk down to the corner
store? Say hello to an old friend? Read a book? If someone wants to
do those things, they’ll almost certainly have no problem doing so,
and that also applies to most of the things that the players tell you
their characters are going to do.
Another thing to keep in mind is that the players are generally
going to propose doing things they want to see happen. So if you

default to yes, you’re really just giving your audience what they
want, which is almost always a winning move. Plus, your players
probably already know how they want to respond to success. They
wanted to jump across the chasm because there was something they
wanted to do on the other side.
To boil all that down: Unless you have a specific reason for NOT
saying yes, your ruling should always be, “Yes, you do that and this
is what happens.”

I LIKE BIG BUTS

There are limits to this, however. Saying yes some of the time is
good. But the problem with saying yes all the time is that it
eliminates the challenge from the game. While we always want to
achieve our goals, the truth is that we also want to overcome
obstacles. It’s only by triumphing over adversity that we can truly
feel accomplishment, and we can’t enjoy the hero’s thrilling escape
unless we first hang them off the cliff:
PLAYER: I want to jump over the chasm.

DM: You leap across, but come up a little bit short. Slamming into
the edge of the abyss, you barely manage to grab onto a thick
vine before plummeting into oblivion.
This is the Yes, but … Yes, you succeed, but there’s a
complication or a consequence or a challenge.
The great thing about, “Yes, but …” is that you’re not negating
the player’s contribution to the conversation. They wanted to get to
the other side of the chasm, and they’ve done that. What you’ve
done is add your own contribution to what’s happening, creating
interest or confronting the player with a new challenge to solve.
The flip side of this coin is the No, but …
Imagine for a moment that the player says they want to do
something that you know is impossible. For example:
PLAYER: I’m going to the library to research parasite demons.

But you know that there’s no library in this small town. Or, if
there is, that it’s too small to have the collection of rare paranormal
books necessary to do meaningful research on parasite demons. This
is a specific reason for not saying yes, which makes it a perfect time
to say no.
When you make a ruling like this, though, it can be useful to take
a step back, think about what the player’s actual goal is (e.g.,
finding information about parasite demons), and offer an alternative
method for doing that:
DM: No, the local library is too small to have specialized
information like that. But you know that the Bodleian Library
has a large collection of paranormal texts, so you could take the
train up to Oxford.
In practice, the difference between “Yes, but …” and “No, but …”
can be razor-thin or even nonexistent at times. That’s fine. We’re not
trying to classify every ruling we make with scientific precision. We
just want to have a few useful rules of thumb that we can use to
make effective and entertaining rulings for our players.

MAKING A CHECK

PLAYER: I attack the orc with my sword!
DM: Okay, but you’ll need to succeed on an attack roll.

Sometimes the answer you’re looking for is neither yes nor no.
Instead, it’s “maybe” or “I’m not sure” or “Let’s find out together!”
When that’s the case, you’ll want to use the rules of the
roleplaying game to determine the character’s success or failure. If
that’s an attack roll in D&D—like trying to stab an orc with your
sword—then the rules are very specific about how the action is to
be resolved: The difficulty of the roll is equal to the orc’s Armor
Class (AC), so you simply roll a 20-sided die, add your attack bonus,
and compare it to the AC. If you rolled equal to or higher than the

difficulty, you successfully stabbed the orc. If you didn’t, then you
missed the orc.
But what if it’s not a combat action? What if the PC is trying to
accomplish something else? There are a number of different rules in
D&D, but the most basic is an ability or skill check. When in doubt,
you can just pick an ability score or skill, set the Difficulty Class
(DC) of the check, and ask the player to roll the dice.
Before we pick up the dice, however, let’s double-check our
check. Should we even be making a check? In fact, how do we know
when it’s the right time to call for a check?
Well, let’s review. If the players ask to do something and success
is trivial or certain, then we should default to yes. If success is
impossible (there is no local library, there’s an invisible wall
blocking the far side of the chasm, etc.), then the answer is no.
Flipping that around, we can see that a check should be used if
success is possible but not certain. (And, equally so, if failure is
possible but not certain.)
Let’s go one step further, though, and consider the potential
failure state. Failure should be meaningful, interesting, or both. If
it’s neither, then you shouldn’t be rolling the dice.
Here’s an example where failure isn’t interesting or meaningful:
PLAYER: I try to pick the lock.
DM: You fail. What do you do?

PLAYER: I try to pick the lock again.
DM: You fail. What do you do?

PLAYER: I try to pick the lock again.
You can see the problem. Because nothing meaningful happens as
a result of failing to pick the lock, the game ends up just kind of
spinning its wheels.
Does this mean you should never call for an ability check to pick
a lock? Not at all. Failing to pick the lock might be meaningful
because:

The door is trapped, and failing to pick the lock will trigger the
trap.

They’re trying to pick the lock during combat, and each time they
fail to open the door their companions have to survive another
round of enemy attacks.
They’re in a hostile area, and if they fail to pick the lock, a guard
patrol will discover them in the act.

Failure is meaningful (and interesting) when it creates an obstacle
or consequences, forcing the PCs to create a new path to their goals.
There are many ways to achieve this, but the easiest way of
implementing meaningful failure is to simply not allow retries on
the check: If you failed to pick the lock on the door, that failed
check tells us that you’ll never be able to pick that lock. You did
your best; it didn’t work.
Now what? Kick it in? Cast a spell? Look for a different entrance?
Look for a key? Seduce the housekeeper? I dunno. You tell me!
As you can see from these alternatives, each new path created
from meaningful failure creates interest: The PCs are leaving
evidence or engaging in further exploration or creating new
relationships. Arguably all of these are, in fact, more interesting
than if they’d simply picked the lock and gone through the door!
(With that being said, it’s equally true that success should be
meaningful, interesting, or both. This usually takes care of itself,
though, because players rarely try to do something unless they want
to see it happen.)
SUCCESS IS STILL GOOD
A trap you can fall into here is thinking, “Well, if failure is better,
then I should just force everything to be a failure!” There’s a long
discussion about all the problems this could create, but the short
version is this: Success is also important if, for no other reason, than
that the players will become increasingly frustrated if they can never
actually accomplish anything. So let the dice fall where they may!

Now that you’ve chosen to make the skill check, you need to
identify the skill and set the difficulty of the check.
Identifying which skill to use is pretty straightforward. You can
usually just scan down the list of skill names and easily spot which
one best fits the action the character is attempting. There are,
however, a couple of curveballs that a game can throw at you here.
If there’s more than one skill that seems as if it would work, just
allow either skill to work. (“Give me an Acrobatics or Athletics
check.”) Players may also propose an alternative check, and you
can usually just default to yes and let them use their preferred
skill. (“Can I make a History check to identify the ruined fane
instead of Religion?”)

If you don’t see a skill that seems appropriate, check the list of
tools to see if the character should be making a tool check instead
(e.g., using thieves’ tools to pick a lock or jeweler’s tools to
identify a rare gemstone).
If there’s neither a skill nor tool for the check at hand, default to
the most appropriate ability check.

If you use the variant rule in D&D for combining skills with
different ability scores—which I recommend, because it can give
you a lot more flexibility in making rulings—you’ll also need to
identify which ability score should be used with the skill. For
example, you might use Intelligence (Investigation) checks to search
a room and Charisma (Investigation) checks to canvass a
neighborhood, or use Wisdom (Animal Handling) to calm or train
your triceratops and Dexterity (Animal Handling) when attempting
a difficult maneuver while riding the triceratops.
Once you’ve identified the skill (or tool or ability score), the next
step is setting the difficulty of the check. In D&D, there are a couple
ways of doing this:

Look at the list of Difficulty Classes on the next page and choose
the one whose description best matches your understanding of
how hard the action would be. (Is it easy? Hard? Very hard?)

Ask yourself what level of skill someone would need in order to
accomplish this task routinely and assign that as the difficulty. (Is
this something an apprentice could do more or less at will? A
professional? A grand master?)

A third option that can work well in other RPGs is to start with a
“default” difficulty and then adjust it up or down by considering
factors that would logically modify that difficulty.
In D&D, for example, you might start with DC 12 as your default
difficulty and, as a rule of thumb, adjust it up or down by two
points for every relevant factor. For example, if the PCs were
making a Wisdom (Perception) check to see if they spotted an
elephant stampede in the distance, you might drop the difficulty by
two (because a herd of elephants is quite large and hard to miss)
and then another two (because the stampede is also making a lot of
noise), resulting in a DC 8 check. If the check was being made in the
middle of a thunderstorm, however, you might bump the difficulty
back up by a couple of points to DC 10.
This method can get a little muddled in D&D, however, because
some of these factors (like the thunderstorm) would be considered
situational modifiers and would normally be handled using the
advantage/disadvantage system. For now, if you want to keep
things simple, just use the Difficulty Class table above to make quick
rulings.

NARRATING OUTCOME

To briefly review, after a player has announced their intention to
take an action, you’ll make a ruling on how the action will be
resolved by either:
defaulting to yes,

saying yes, but …,

saying no (and trying to provide the no, but …), or
making a check.

If you choose to make a check, then you

identify the skill,

determine the difficulty, and
roll the dice.

Now, whether you default to yes or make a check, what you’ll be
left with is the outcome of that action: You know what happened,
and you get to describe that to the players! What do they see on the
other side of the chasm? What do they learn about parasite demons?
If they killed the orc with their attack, what does that look like? Did
they skewer the orc? Chop off their head? Knock them into the
chasm?
The truth is that narrating outcome is as much art as science.
There is no “right” answer as to how the orc died or how you
describe this to your players. That’s something that you get to
create, and the truly great thing is that nobody else will (or can!)
create it exactly the way that you do. That’s what’s so exciting about
playing and mastering a roleplaying game.
With that being said, there are two key questions that you need to
answer when describing an outcome.
If the result is a success, the questions are:
How does the intention succeed?

Are there any complications (i.e., unintended side effects)? (There
don’t need to be and, perhaps, often won’t be.)
If the result is a failure, the questions are:
How does the action fail?

What are the consequences for failure? (There should be
consequences, as they are what make failure meaningful.)
We’ll explore more advanced techniques for framing and
describing outcomes later, but for now I can offer a few quick tips to
get you started.

OUTCOME FACTORS
Skill
Knowledge
Power

Finesse

Environment
Time
Luck

The Target
Bystanders
Tools

First, keep it short. Rich, beautiful descriptions are great, but
you’ll rarely go wrong by throwing the ball back to your players as
quickly as you can. Remember that the outcome of the action—
whether success or failure—has created a new situation for the
players to respond to, and they’re likely eager to do so!
Second, you probably already know what the description is! If the
character succeeded, they did whatever it was the player said they
were trying to do. You can just repeat that back to them: “You leap
over the chasm and land on the other side” or “You stab the orc.”
On the other hand, if the character failed, then there was a reason
you thought failure would be meaningful. (If there wasn’t, you
would have just defaulted to yes, right?) Was it because they might
fall into the chasm? Or get caught by a guard patrol while picking
the lock? Whatever it was, you can just tell the player that it
happened.
Finally, it can be useful to think in terms of why the attempt failed
or succeeded. In the sidebar above, you can see a list of factors that
can affect the outcome of an action. If you’re struggling to come up
with a description, just pick one and explain how it caused the
outcome.

The character’s own skill is often an easy default. “You rolled
well” or “You rolled poorly” often gets translated, for whatever
reason, to “Your character did well” or “Your character screwed
up.” But it can be useful to remember that external factors can play
a key role in success or failure. This can be particularly useful when
describing failure, because it doesn’t belittle the PCs’ competency:
Your blade strikes the orc right in the chest, but it’s turned aside by
the orc’s breastplate. You know which book you need, but it’s been
checked out. You cleared the chasm just fine, but the ledge crumbles
under your feet as you land.

THE DUNGEON MASTER’S SECRET WEAPON

Now that you’ve wrapped your head around making a ruling, you’re
ready for the big secret: Being a dungeon master is easy. It’s much
easier than being a player.
This might seem absurd right now. Easier? How is that possible?
You have an entire world to run. The players can ask you almost
anything and you always need to have an answer ready to go. What
if you don’t know what should happen next? Everyone else is
depending on you! The whole thing will fall apart!
But it’s easy because you have a secret weapon: “Yes, that
happens. Now what do you do?”
As the DM, it can feel as if you’re the one who’s always being put
on the spot. That at any time the players can force you to be
creative on demand. In reality, though, the exact opposite is true
because you control the entire world.
When a player says they want to do something, you may have an
immediate creative response to it: some interesting twist or obstacle
or bit of flavor that leaps into your mind and would enhance and
build on what they said. If so, great! Do that.
But if not, then all you need to say is, “Yes, that happens. Now
what do you do?”
It’s a convenient bit of judo, and it means that the DM is never
truly put on the spot, because at any time they can simply flip the

player’s action back and put the player on the spot. It is, in fact, the
players, not the DM, who are ultimately responsible for driving the
game forward.
Ideally, of course, you’ll want to dress up, “Yes, that happens,”
and make it pretty. So rather than this …
PLAYER: I want to jump over the chasm.

DM: Yes, that happens. Now what do you do?
You’d say something like this …
PLAYER: I want to jump over the chasm.

DM: You take a running start and leap, easily clearing the gap and
landing on the cobblestones on the far side. Now what do you
do?
As you’re dressing up your default to yes, you may find these two
corollaries to your secret weapon useful:
“How are you doing that?” and
“What are you trying to do?”

If you can’t figure out how the yes happens, it’s usually because
the players haven’t given you enough information about what
they’re doing. Don’t be afraid to ask them.
PLAYER: I want to find out more information about parasite
demons.
DM: How are you doing that?

PLAYER: Hmm … Maybe I could do some research at the local
library?
DM: You can do that. What information are you looking for,
exactly?
PLAYER: I’d love to know how we could detect them.

DM: Sure. You find a book of lore written by a scholar named
Sagrathea. He reports that parasite demons can be revealed by
splashing holy water on their host.
So no matter what happens as you work and play your way
through the rest of this book, if you’re ever feeling lost, adrift, or
overwhelmed, just remember your secret weapon.

STEP 2: HOW TO RUN
A ROOM
Now let’s take a peek at the dungeon key. The key describes the
dungeon, with each numbered entry in the key describing the
associated room on the dungeon map. In a dungeon, therefore, the
key provides the environment in which the PCs will take their
actions, and provides the raw material you can use to describe the
outcomes of those actions.
Let’s start by taking a look at a sample dungeon room key:
AREA 15: CRYPTIC LIBRARY
The room is of crimson and dark wood beneath a vaulted ceiling. A
set of tall double doors, matching the ones you entered through,
faces you on the opposite side of the room. A large pentagonal
mahogany table stands in the center of the chamber. There are five
large bookcases stuffed full of tomes and scrolls along the paneled
walls. Sunlight streams in through bay windows with a built-in
bench. The windows are leaded stained glass depicting a subtle
pattern of golden florets.

WISDOM (PERCEPTION)-DC 15
To spot the cloaker hiding among the shadows on the ceiling.

GM Note: This cloaker (a flying, manta ray–like monster) belongs
to the colony that can be found in Area 46: The Undercaverns.

INTELLIGENCE (HISTORY)-DC 12
To recognize that the golden florets are the crest of the Klaavian
Dynasty of the 14th century, revealing that this was once a royal
residence.
CLOAKER: If unnoticed, the cloaker on the ceiling will drop down
and attack the first character entering the room. If noticed, it will
emit its unnatural moan, affecting all creatures within 60 feet
(DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened), before
attacking.
MAHOGANY TABLE
There are several dark stains on the surface of the table, and the legs
are engraved with arcane runes. A DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check
identifies the stains as blood. A DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana) check
identifies the runes as being associated with rites of human sacrifice.
BOOKCASES
The books and other documents here are all of an occult nature.
There is a focus on Natharran mythology, particularly an enigmatic
figure known as Basp-Attu. A DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check
identifies Basp-Attu as a dual-bodied demon said to have been born
from the mixed ichor of two dead gods during the War of Falling
Stars.
WINDOWS
The bay windows look out onto a sun-dappled orchard. A DC 12
Wisdom (Perception) check notices that the apples on the trees are
bright blue rather than red.

THE ANATOMY OF A ROOM

Looking at our key for the Cryptic Library, we can see that it’s
broken down into four parts.
First, the room has a number and a name. The name is useful
when you’re running the adventure because it will, at a glance,
remind you of the room’s purpose and content.
Second, there is boxed text. This provides an initial description of
the room. It can be either read verbatim to the players or
summarized in your own words, but the key concept—if you’ll
pardon the pun—is that it provides the information that anyone
walking into the room would instantly perceive.
Immediately following the boxed text, you’ll find any reactive
skill checks for the room. These include information that, like the
boxed text, would be instantly perceived by someone walking into
the room, but only if they succeed on the check. In this case, a
Wisdom (Perception) check should be made to see if the PCs spot
the hidden monster. There’s also an Intelligence (History) check,
because while anyone can notice the golden florets decorating the
window, only someone with specialized knowledge will recognize
their significance.
The rest of the key is made up of room elements, each of which
is described in detail.
So what exactly is a room element? Well, it can be almost
anything or anyone. Basically, anything interesting in the room that
is either hidden or simply has additional details that would not be
immediately apparent to someone walking into the room should be
described as a room element. If, or when, the PCs investigate that
particular element, they can discover these additional details or
hidden secrets.
(Other elements, like the cloaker in the Cryptic Library, might
decide to investigate the PCs first.)
This ultimately brings us back to the core loop of the dungeon
experience: When the PCs enter a room, you use the boxed text to
tell them what can be seen at a glance. This provides the players,

either directly or indirectly, with a list of the notable things in the
room—bookcases, a mahogany table, bay windows. This list may be
immediately supplemented by reactive skill checks, after which the
players can declare actions to investigate or interact with the
various elements in the room.
Their exploration of the room might include additional skill
checks to find, access, identify, or otherwise gain treasure or
information. If you’ve added creatures or other characters to the
room, then combat or roleplaying (or both) is likely to
spontaneously erupt.
One thing to keep in mind through all of this is that the room key
does not describe the experience of the room. It merely gives you
the raw material. It is by using that raw material to actively play in
response to the actions of the PCs that the unique experience of the
room will emerge during actual play.
When the PCs have finished investigating the room, they can then
choose an exit—which may, of course, be the same way they came
in—and make their way to a new room, at which point the cycle can
begin anew.
GM NOTES
Because the goal of a written scenario is for it to be run for
players, it’s generally good practice to keep the dungeon key
focused on what the PCs can discover and interact with. In
some cases, however, there will be clarifying details or
background information that may be useful for the GM running
the scenario—e.g., what the strange footprints the PCs have
discovered belong to—but do not have a clear mechanism, at
least for the moment, by which the PCs can discover them.
I’ve found it useful to clearly separate this information from the
rest of the key using the “GM Notes” tag. They are best kept
brief. If, as you start designing your own dungeons, you find
your key becoming overwhelmed by lengthy background
information, see if there’s a way you can reframe that material

so that the PCs can discover it. After all, if the players can
never learn something, does it really exist?

HOMEWORK

YOUR FIRST DUNGEON
So running a basic dungeon can be summed up as follows:
Describing a room

Making reactive skill checks, if any

Responding to PC actions by making rulings
Repeating until the PCs leave the room
Describing the next room

And so forth.
In other words, running rooms and making rulings.
You now know how to do those things, which means you’re ready
to run your first adventure. (I told you it would happen fast!) On

pages 46–64, you’ll find Mephits & Magmin, a dungeon adventure
I’ve designed specifically for you.
You’ll want to start by reading the full adventure. With a clearly
presented dungeon adventure like this, you could run it blind by
reading each room key when the PCs enter the room for the first
time, but I wouldn’t recommend it. (And you can’t necessarily rely
on most published adventures to be clearly presented like this.)
You’ll have a much better experience if you’re familiar with the
adventure and are just using the text as a reference or reminder
during play. It will let you stay more focused on your players and
their experience, giving you the freedom to actively play with them
at the table.
In fact, if you’re feeling nervous, read the adventure again a
couple hours before the game starts. It’s the length of a short story,
so it shouldn’t take too long. But you definitely don’t need to
memorize the adventure! After all, we write things down so that we
don’t have to remember them.
WHO DO I PLAY WITH?
Like any other game, the easiest answer to that is “your friends.”
Just ask a few of them if they’d like to play a game with you. You
can also check out Finding Players in the Extra Credit section on
page 435.

NAVIGATING THE MAP

The dungeon map for Mephits & Magmin can be found on page 47.
Take a look at it now.
Dungeon maps are often drawn on graph paper, with each
square representing a certain distance. This makes it easy to simply
count out distance when that sort of thing matters (during combat,
for example, or while leaping over a chasm). The scale on this map
indicates that 1 square = 5 feet.

Each room in the dungeon, as we’ve discussed, is labeled with a
number that will let you easily identify the entry describing that
room in the dungeon key. Most of the rooms in Mephits & Magmin
are connected by tunnels. You can use the information in Dungeon
Features, page 48, and Corridor Themes, page 49, to describe these
tunnels to your players as the PCs move along them. It’s generally
best to keep this description simple: Indicate the direction of the
tunnel, use one or two details to characterize it, and mention how
long the tunnel is.
As the PCs approach the entrance to a room, describe it to the
players (e.g., “Up ahead you can see the tunnel opening up into a
larger cavern” or “There’s a door on the left side of the hallway”).
This will give the players an opportunity to describe how they’re
approaching the room, whether they’re being stealthy or charging in
with a lusty battle cry.
In addition to the walls and halls and rooms, you’ll also notice
some specific map symbols that are used to indicate specific
features of the dungeon. We’ll discuss these symbols and how you
can use them to create your own dungeon maps later (see here), but
for Mephits & Magmin there are four symbols you’ll want to know:
indicates the presence of an open pit in the floor. This
adventure includes two open pits, both of which are located in
Area 2 of the dungeon. The key for Area 2 describes how these
specific open pits work.

indicates a passageway that is concealed or otherwise not
immediately obvious to the PCs. You’ll find one in Area 5, and
the key describes how it can be found.

indicates a change in elevation. You’ll see these along various
corridors, indicating that those floors are sloping down in the
direction of the arrow. So, for example, Area 10 is deeper
underground than Areas 8 and 9.
is a generic marker used to indicate the position of a point of

interest. In Area 2 of the dungeon, for example, it indicates the

specific location of a switch that controls the release of steaming
hot volcanic gas into the open pits.
I recommend making a copy of this map and laying it on the table
in front of you while you’re running the adventure. It’ll help you
stay oriented and keep track of where the PCs are, and the fact that
you won’t need to keep flipping back and forth between the map
and the room descriptions will, in my experience, make running the
adventure infinitely easier. With the map lying flat, you can even
use a small token or coin to keep track of the group’s position.

ENDING THE ADVENTURE

Mephits & Magmin reaches its climax when the PCs defeat (or
otherwise deal with) Asuvius, the magmin uraniac in charge of the
sinister activities happening deep within Firebelch Cavern. After
you’ve finished playing through a conclusion like this—in this or
any other adventure—there’ll be a few things you’ll want to do to
wrap things up.
First, the epilogue. Give the players some space to tie off any
loose ends they’re still interested in. In a dungeon scenario like this,
that will usually include finishing their exploration of the room
where the final fight took place. It might also include checking out
any rooms they skipped or missed earlier.
That’s all great. For this particular scenario, if there are any
magmin or mephits remaining after the climax (because the PCs
haven’t encountered them yet), I recommend having them flee the
caverns and disappear into the night. (The other option would be
running additional fights after the climax that will probably just feel
pointless and drag the session out for no reason.)
Beyond the purely practical, this period of epilogue can also
feature some final roleplaying moments as the PCs interact with
each other and the players reflect on what they’ve accomplished. I
recommend encouraging that if you can. (In other scenarios, for
example, there might be a convenient NPC who could actually
prompt a conversation.)

You might also discover that a time-skip can be an effective part
of the epilogue. After the PCs have wrapped things up in Mephits &
Magmin, for example, you might cut to them tracking down Elsie
Longfoot (see here) and have her ask them to describe their
adventures as a way of reinforcing what they’ve experienced and
providing a final act of closure.
Or maybe not. This is more art than science. You’ll need to play
this by ear a bit, and what’s right for your adventure will depend on
your players, their characters, and what happened at the table. (For
example, maybe the PCs all hated Elsie, so that would be a sour note
to end things on. Or maybe one of the PCs has fallen madly in love
with her, and the epilogue is the two of them going on a date.) If in
doubt, you can always ask the players if there are any loose ends or
miscellaneous business they want to take care of.
After, and sometimes during, the epilogue, there are a couple bits
of key bookkeeping that you’ll want to make sure get taken care of.
The PCs will need to split the treasure. They’ll usually do this
themselves (and use any number of bizarre schemes for doing it),
but if your players are also new to the game you may need to
remind them.
While they’re figuring out the treasure, you should take a moment
to calculate experience points. The default method in D&D is to
total the experience points (XP) for each monster defeated and then
divide that total evenly between the PCs. For quick reference, here
are the XP values for the monsters the PCs may find in Mephits &
Magmin:
Mud Mephit—50 XP

Smoke Mephit—50 XP
Steam Mephit—50 XP
Magmin—100 XP

Magma Mephit—100 XP

Animated Armor—200 XP

As an alternative, you can use a milestone award and just tell the
players that they advance to second level as the adventure comes to
a conclusion.
With all of the rewards taken care of, take care of any other
miscellaneous bookkeeping that needs to be sorted. You probably
won’t have anything like that after running Mephits & Magmin, but
if everybody had a good time, you should take a moment to
schedule your next session.
Don’t worry, we’ll make sure you’re ready for next time!
WHAT ABOUT COMBAT?
Something we haven’t taken a close look at yet is what you
should do when a fight breaks out. There are a couple reasons
for that.
First, the rulebook for your RPG of choice probably describes a
very specific procedure for running combat. (In the case of
D&D, that’s rolling initiative for every participant and then
resolving their declared actions in initiative order.) When a
fight starts, just follow that procedure. When the fight’s done,
the PCs will still be in the room and you can continue resolving
actions until they decide to leave.
Second, although RPG combat is often highly structured, you’re
still just resolving actions. You may have a few specialized
mechanics like attack and damage rolls, but the same general
principles of making a ruling apply. Just use them and you’ll be
fine!
If combat in your RPG of choice is not highly structured with a
specific procedure, then it most likely defaults back to normal
action resolution, and the normal guidelines for making rulings
will only apply more strongly.

DUNGEON ADVENTURE

MEPHITS & MAGMIN
BACKGROUND

Firebelch Cavern is an underground system of pyroducts. Also
known as lava tubes, these caves are formed when the skin of a lava
flow cools and hardens, but the liquid rock within continues to flow
through, leaving behind a hollow tube. (Or, more commonly,
leaving behind an overlapping network of such tubes built up over
the course of multiple and divergent flows.)
The cave is fairly remote from local settlements, but is not
unknown to people in the region. Until recently, however, there has
been little reason to remark upon it. That changed a little over a
month ago when a small band of magmin moved in.
Magmin are human-like elementals native to the Plane of Fire.
Their cracked and blackened skin, viewed through the flames which
continually burn around their bodies, has the appearance of halfcooled lava.
This particular group is led by a magmin uraniac named
Asuvius. Otherwise identical to their magmin kin, a uraniac’s head
is studded with chunks of strange silver-white rocks surrounded by
an unearthly blue glow. The presence of these uncanny metallic
shards cause the uraniac’s head to bulge, often reaching a size three
or four times larger than normal. This is often accompanied by a

super-magmin intelligence (granting a typical uraniac an
Intelligence score of 16).
Asuvius has come to Firebelch Cavern in order to take advantage
of several key resources—notably geothermal energy, a burnt
heartwood tree (Area 8), and unique crystalline growths (Areas 5
and 10)—to conduct technomantic and alchemical experiments. His
first goal was the creation of mephits—small but potent elemental
spirits who can serve at Asuvius’s whims.
In this, Asuvius has already succeeded, and a number of mephits
can be found throughout the cave complex, guarding it against
intruders who would interrupt Asuvius’s efforts to further perfect his
techniques.

IMPERFECT MEPHITS: Due to the mephits in Firebelch Cavern
being created instead of summoned, they do NOT have their
normal Death Burst effects.

SCENARIO HOOK

Local hunters and trappers have seen strange lights emanating from
Firebelch Cavern. The village provost has asked the PCs to
investigate the cave and make sure the lights do not pose a danger.
One of the trappers, a halfling named Elsie Longfoot, guides the PCs
within sight of the cave entrance but will go no further.
As the DM, you might choose to play through these events. (You
could, for example, describe the PCs sharing a drink in a tavern
when the village provost sends a messenger asking to speak with
them.) But, particularly if this is your first adventure, it’s just fine to
start things in medias res: Briefly explain to the players how they
got to Firebelch Cavern, exactly as described above, and then go to
Area 1, below, and describe what they see.
OTHER SCENARIO HOOKS
I’m only offering one scenario hook for Mephits & Magmin
here. If you were running this adventure as part of an ongoing
game and wanted to offer multiple scenario hooks, or if you
just don’t like this scenario hook, check out Scenario Hooks on
page 498 for a deep dive into how you can create and
customize your own scenario hooks.

DUNGEON FEATURES
Illumination: None.

Ceiling Height (Tunnels): Varies between 4 feet and 11 feet (1d8
+ 3 ft.). This can be the result of either the ceiling shifting or the
floor rising unevenly. This can become cramped enough to

impose disadvantage or difficult terrain on PCs at the DM’s
discretion.

Ceiling Height (Finished Area): Unless otherwise indicated, 6
feet. Designed for magmin (with an average height of 4 ft.) and
low enough that tall characters will need to stoop slightly.

Walls: Gray or black volcanic rock (AC 17, climb DC 12). Can be
either rough or smooth to the touch, and in some places razorsharp. The walls are often fissured and seamed.

CORRIDOR THEMES

The passages in Firebelch Cavern are lava tubes. They are roughly
circular, with walls, floor, and ceiling formed from gray or black
volcanic rock. They are usually sloped, although not steeply so.
Features you might use to describe specific sections of the tube
include the following:
Varied Height, see Dungeon Features on the previous page.
Difficult Terrain, as a result of the uneven floor.

Tree Roots, growing through the ceiling of the tube in the areas
near the surface of the dungeon.

Lavacicles, which are stalactites and stalagmites formed from
cooling lava. They can include tubular formations (like hollow
straws) and also shark tooth stalactites (which have a broad,
tapering appearance like the tooth or fin of a shark). These can
also be a reason for the total height of a tube to abruptly shrink.

Iridescence, where the impurities of the volcanic rock gleam and
glimmer with strange colors.
Fissures, where the rock has fractured apart (due to cooling or
later weathering).

You may find good results with combining two or three of these
elements together for each tube, giving each one a unique (yet
myriad) character.

AREA 1: CAVE ENTRANCE

You’re near the bottom of a steeply sloped, rocky outcropping in a
heavily forested area. Above you a dark mass of stone bulges out of
the slope. At its center, partly obscured by verdant green growth
sagging from the top of the bulge, is a ragged-edged, black hole that
punches back through the rock.

In front of the cave entrance, there’s a slag of broken rock
forming a kind of natural portico that extends out for perhaps 20 or
25 feet to the edge of the tree line. Three large mounds of wet mud
have been heaped at various points on the slag.
WISDOM (PERCEPTION)-DC 15
To notice that one of the “mud heaps” seems to have a nervous
twitch. A DC 19 check fully reveals that the three “heaps” are
actually small elemental creatures, in which case a DC 14
Intelligence (Arcana or Nature) check identifies them as mud
mephits.
MUD MEPHITS (4): The three mud heaps are mud mephits. A
fourth “mud heap” is located 40 feet down the lava tube from
the cave entrance. Ideally (for the mud mephits), the PCs will
enter the tunnel without realizing what the mud heaps are. The
mephits will then animate and attack, cutting off their escape.
CAVE ENTRANCE
Anyone inspecting the cave can make a DC 12 Intelligence (Nature)
check to identify this as a lava tube. Formed when the surface of a

lava flow cools and hardens but the lava inside continues flowing
forward, these caves can extend for dozens of miles. (Given the
forest growth surrounding this cave, it is clear that whatever
volcanism formed this cave happened long ago.)

AREA 2: FORK IN THE TUBE

Ahead of you, the slope of the tunnel bottoms out and, a dozen or
so feet farther on, it forks, with passages both left and right splitting
away from you in concave curves. With the passage leveling out
here, it seems some sort of gray gas or smoke has accumulated on
the floor.

WISDOM (PERCEPTION)-DC 19
To notice the smoke mephits—one on either side of the fork
between Area 1 and the open pits—hiding in the smoke. (If the
smoke is somehow blown away, the mephits will need to make
Stealth checks to remain hidden.)
MEPHITS-STEAM (1) & SMOKE (2): The smoke mephits are
hiding in the smoke. The steam mephit is waiting at the switch,
which activates the steam vents in the open pit. If the PCs reach
the far side of a pit, the steam mephit will move to engage them.
SMOKE
A DC 12 Intelligence (Nature) check will recognize the smoke as
dangerous volcanic gas. Anyone inhaling the gas (e.g., by lying

prone in it for a full round) must make a DC 12 Constitution saving
throw or become poisoned. (The mephits are not affected by this.)
POISONED: A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls
and ability checks.
STEAM PITS
As indicated on the map, there are open pits located along both
branches of the lava tube. A DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check
reveals the presence of the open pits beneath the smoke.
The pits are 10 feet deep, dealing 1d6 bludgeoning damage to
anyone falling in.
The sides of the pits are seamed with deep fissures, through which
volcanic gases leak. These have been rigged so that someone
throwing a switch at the north end of the fork (indicated with † will
vent steaming hot volcanic gas into the pits. Anyone in a pit when
this happens must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or
suffer 1d8 fire damage and the poisoned condition. (On a success,
they take half damage and are not poisoned.)
It takes 1d4 rounds for the volcanic gases to build back up again,
at which point the steam can be triggered again.
DO WE REALLY NEED TO FIGHT?
Your players might want to take the diplomatic approach. The
encounter here has been designed to discourage that (since the
mephits have been instructed to ambush anyone approaching),
but whether here or later you can certainly give them a chance
to talk things out. These mephits speak Ignan (the magmin
tongue) rather than the usual elemental languages, which could
be a clue that something unusual is happening here.
How far can diplomacy go? That’s up to you, and it will largely
depend on the agenda you choose to give Asuvius. Is he just an
alien alchemist conducting experiments? Then peaceful

negotiations are likely, and maybe the PCs can help him hatch
some elemental seeds (see Area 8, here).
If you’d rather lean into the simplicity of combat, then
Asuvius’s true goal might be using his new elemental minions
to assert dominion over the local communities. Hard to
compromise with that.

AREA 3: PISTON ROOM

The lava tube empties out into a wide square chamber, 15 feet
across and perhaps three dozen wide. On the far wall, off to your
left, there is an open archway.

The stone here appears to have been carved back, but the walls
are not perfectly finished. They have a sort of rough undulation to
their surface, which gleams with an iridescent sheen.
In the center of the room there is a large contraption of bolted
brass, festooned with a motley collection of pistons that churn
endlessly with a hiss of steam. From the top of this contraption an
8-inch pipe runs up to the ceiling, then turns and runs through the
wall.
INTELLIGENCE (INVESTIGATION)-DC 12
A close inspection of the floor may reveal that there are small,
humanoid footprints that have been burned into the surface. They
are difficult to make out against the dark stone and crisscross each
other countless times, creating something of a hopeless, visually
confusing muddle.

GM Note: These footprints are made by the magmin. They are not
found in the lava tubes, where the undisturbed volcanic rock is
solid enough to not be disturbed by them.
WALLS
Close inspection of the walls will reveal that they were not carved
but were instead somehow melted into their current configuration.
PISTON CONTRAPTION
The piston assembly is pumping volcanic gases out of the ground
here, superheating them, and then passing them over a blue-white
stone (embedded within a glass cylinder visible within the
contraption), before pumping them, under high pressure, through
the brass pipe that passes through the wall.
Intelligence (Alchemist’s Supplies)-DC 12: The gas is being
alchemically infused with the essence of the blue-white stone. A
DC 15 check identifies the blue-white stone as a unicorn’s bezoar.
(Bezoars are growths that can occur within the gastrointestinal
tracts of various animals. Unicorn bezoars are particularly rare
and said to be infused with life-giving properties.)
STEAM PIPE
The brass pipe is fitted with several valves. Breaking the pipe (AC
16, 10 HP) will cause steam to burst out, filling a 10-foot-square
area. Fiddling with the valves will similarly cause steam to vent
1d4-1 rounds later (on a result of 0, it happens immediately). In
either case, characters in the area suffer 4d6 fire damage (DC 16
Dexterity saving throw for half damage).
GM Note: The steam pipe passes through Areas 5, 7, and 10.
SHORT REST
If your players are also new to D&D, you might want to remind
them that this would be a good time to take a short rest (to

regain their hit points). It will be very difficult for them to
succeed in the adventure if they don’t recuperate.

AREA 4: ANTECHAMBER

Two low archways—low enough that the tallest among you need to
stoop to pass through—face each other on opposite sides of this long
chamber that appears to have been carved out of the stone. Along
one of the other walls, a gaping hole leads to a tunnel that slants
rapidly down and out of sight.

INTELLIGENCE (INVESTIGATION)-DC 12
A close inspection of the floor may reveal that there are small,
humanoid footprints that have been burned into the surface. They
are difficult to make out against the dark stone and crisscross each
other countless times, but they clearly pass through all three
entrances to this chamber.
GM Note: These footprints are made by the magmin. They are not
found in the lava tubes, where the undisturbed volcanic rock is
solid enough to not be disturbed by them.
WALLS
Close inspection of the walls will reveal that they were not carved
but were instead somehow melted into their current configuration.

AREA 5: VOLCANIC CRYSTALS

At one end of this long chamber, there is an archway in one corner
and a large tunnel slanting down from the opposite corner.

The far end of the chamber from these passages is filled with a
huge, crystalline growth. There must be hundreds of individual
crystals in the mass, each glowing with a spectral greenish light that
casts strange shadows down the fissured walls.
Crossing the room near the crystals is an 8-inch brass pipe that’s
been fastened to the ceiling.
INTELLIGENCE (INVESTIGATION)-DC 12 (FOOTPRINTS)
A close inspection of the floor may reveal that there are small
humanoid footprints that have been burned into the surface. They
are difficult to make out against the dark stone and crisscross each
other countless times, but clearly they pass through the entrances to
Area 4 and Area 8. (They do NOT pass into Area 6, which is
unknown to the magmin.)
GM Note: These footprints are made by the magmin. They are not
found in the lava tubes, where the undisturbed volcanic rock is
solid enough to not be disturbed by them.

INTELLIGENCE
(INVESTIGATION)-DC
15
(CONCEALED
PASSAGE)
Although it is not immediately apparent, one of the fissures in the
south wall is actually large enough to squeeze through, allowing
characters to crawl through to Area 6 with a successful DC 12
Dexterity check. (This check is made with advantage if the character
is not wearing armor.)
CRYSTALS
Any inspection of the crystalline mass reveals that a significant
number of crystals have been removed. A DC 12 Intelligence
(Nature) check indicates that these are volcanic crystals, while a DC
15 Intelligence (Alchemist’s Supplies) check reveals these crystals
have been adulterated with Stygian gas, granting them their strange
illumination and also making them a valuable catalyst for various
alchemical procedures.
If properly harvested, a process requiring 10 minutes per crystal
and a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Alchemist’s Supplies) check, the
crystals with the strongest adulteration are worth 10 gold pieces
(gp) each. There are 30 such crystals, each weighing roughly 5
pounds and averaging 1 foot in length, remaining.
GM Note: The crystals harvested here are being used by Asuvius
in Area 10.
WALLS
Close inspection of the walls will reveal that they were not carved,
but were instead somehow melted into their current configuration.
STEAM PIPE
The brass pipe is fitted with several valves. Breaking the pipe (AC
16, 10 HP) will cause steam to burst out, filling a 10-foot-square
area. Fiddling with the valves will similarly cause steam to vent
1d4-1 rounds later (on a result of 0, it happens immediately). In
either case, characters in the area suffer 4d6 fire damage (DC 16
Dexterity saving throw for half damage).

GM Note: The steam pipe starts in Area 3, passes through here,
and continues through Areas 7 and 10.

AREA 6: LAVA NODULE

Scraping through the rough volcanic rock, you scramble into a
large, spherical chamber about 15 feet across, as if you were
standing inside a kind of rocky bubble, its walls studded with large
gypsum crystals that thrust out chaotically in every direction.

GM Note: The magmin are not aware of this area, making it a
safe place for the PCs to take a short rest.

AREA 7: CROSSROADS

Up ahead the tunnel crosses another, forming an X-shaped
intersection. An 8-inch brass pipe angles across the intersection at
ceiling height, emerging from one side and passing into the next.

STEAM PIPE
The brass pipe is fitted with several valves. Breaking the pipe (AC
16, 10 HP) will cause steam to burst out, filling a 10-foot-square

area. Fiddling with the valves will similarly cause steam to vent
1d4-1 rounds later (on a result of 0, it happens immediately). In
either case, characters in the area suffer 4d6 fire damage (DC 16
Dexterity saving throw for half damage).
GM Note: The steam pipe comes from Areas 3 and 5, and
continues to Area 10.

AREA 8: THE MEPHIT TREE

A large, globular chamber opens at the end of the tunnel. It’s about
40 feet across and almost as high. The ceiling twinkles like starlight.
A second tunnel, nearby, leads away from the chamber in another
direction. Roughly opposite the tunnels, there is a skeletal tree,
burnt black, its bark and branches a cracked charcoal. Large
glowing pods sprout cyst-like from its dead, obsidian branches.

Two short humanoid figures stand near the tree. They are
wreathed in flame, sending strange patterns of light and shadow
dancing across the tree and cave walls. Their skin looks like molten
lava. They are directing two of the small mud elementals, which are
currently in the process of removing one of the glowing pods from
the tree.
MAGMIN (2) & MUD MEPHITS (2)
The magmin are overseeing the harvesting of elemental seeds from
the tree. If combat breaks out, the magmin will direct the mud
mephits to attack while using their own action each round to use a

special Superheat ability. Only when the mephits are destroyed, or if
they are forced to engage, will the magmin attack themselves.
SUPERHEAT: The magmin plunges their hand into a mud mephit
within reach. This superheats the mud mephit, causing its body to
boil and granting +1d4 fire damage to its fist attacks and mud
breath.
THE TREE
A DC 12 Intelligence (Nature) check will identify this as the
remnant of an elven heartwood tree. A physical inspection of the
tree combined with a DC 16 check will reveal that the tree was once
home to a dryad ovule that’s perished in the ancient flames of the
lava that created these tunnels.
A DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check or any specific
investigation of the glowing pods reveals that alchemical stents have
been attached to the branches at the points where the pods seem to
“sprout” from the tree (see below).
ELEMENTAL SEEDS
A DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that the glowing pods
are infused with powerful elemental forces of earth and fire. These
appear to be similar to the elemental forces found in mephits.
A DC 16 Intelligence (Alchemist’s Supplies) check will indicate
the alchemical stents are being used to draw a slow, steady trickle of
elemental energy through a matrix of fey energy, which seems to be
faintly manifest within the burnt wood of the tree. The elemental
seeds are the physical manifestation of this “elemental sieving.”
GM Note: These elemental seeds are harvested here and then
taken to Area 10, where they hatch (or perhaps “sprout” would
be a better term) into mephits.
CEILING
The ceiling twinkles because it’s studded with rough chrysoberyls. If
collected, the set of small gems has a total value of 150 gp, but this

can be doubled with a DC 16 Dexterity (Jeweler’s Tools) check to
finish them.
CRANK UP THE HEAT
As the PCs head down the long tunnels to Area 10 from Areas 8
or 9, describe the air slowly growing hotter until the heat
becomes stifling. (Engage all of the PCs’ senses, not just their
sight.)

AREA 9: LAVA CANAL

The tunnel widens into a long chamber about 20 feet across. It’s lit
with a red and garish light emanating from a canal of lava that
crosses the middle of the chamber, 20 or 30 feet away. A metal
bridge crosses the midpoint of the canal, narrowly accessible
between two small pools of lava.

The floor of the chamber is broken basalt. Short pillars of
geometric rock thrust up haphazardly at different heights. At one
end of the chamber, a 10-foot-wide pillar of long-cooled lava
stretches erratically from floor to ceiling.
FLOOR
The broken basalt floor makes this chamber difficult terrain.

DIFFICULT TERRAIN: Each foot of movement in difficult terrain
costs 1 extra foot. (Characters effectively move at half their
normal speed.)
LAVA POOLS/MAGMA MEPHITS (2)
Those approaching the canal will note two small pools of lava, just a
couple of feet across, flanking the south side of the bridge. A DC 18
Wisdom (Perception) check reveals that these lava pools are, in fact,
magma mephits. They’ll wait for the PCs to begin crossing the
bridge and then animate, preferably cutting the group in half and
separating them from each other.
BRIDGE
The metal is superheated by the proximity of the lava canal. Those
touching it with their bare skin must make a DC 12 Constitution
saving throw or suffer 1d2 fire damage.

AREA 10: ELEMENTAL GEODE

You’re looking into the interior of a giant, glittering geode, nearly
100 feet across. Pulses of light pass through the crystals of the
geode in waves; you can pick out two or three distinct waves, each
circling around the geode.

A brass pipe punches through the skein of the geode and crosses
to the far side, where it’s connected to a technomantic apparatus
that appears to be partially extruded from the geode’s crystals. A
huge clockwork, humanoid figure has been strapped into this
apparatus.

In the center of the geode is an inflationary rift—a dome of
black, volcanic rock that has pushed up through the geode. A redhot glow oozes from a cracked rift that crosses the top of this dome.
Above this rift, more technomantic machinery has been built, with
various pipes piercing down into the molten, steaming rock.
Atop this machinery is a squat, humanoid figure whose skin
appears to be formed from red-hot lava. Bathed in flame, the
figure’s head is curiously bulbous—grotesquely distended to perhaps
three or four times that of a human and studded with strange silverwhite rocks surrounded by an unearthly blue glow.
There are two more of the lava-skinned humanoids—these
without the bulbous heads. Above, circling around the top of the
geode, are two imp-like creatures with bodies composed entirely
from steam.
DIFFICULT TERRAIN: The curved, crystalline “floor” of the
geode makes the interior difficult terrain.
CREATURES

Asuvius, the magmin uraniac (use magmin stats, but with
Intelligence 16 and proficiency in Alchemist’s Supplies and
Arcana)
2 magmin

2 smoke mephits

Steampowered construct (use animated armor stats, see here)
ASUVIUS’S TECHNOMANTIC PERCH
From his perch, Asuvius will spend his first action initiating the
activation sequence for the steampowered construct (see here). He
will use his bonus action on that round, and subsequent rounds,
locking in targets for the construct (i.e., the PCs), one per bonus
action.

STEAMBLAST: As an action taken by someone at the controls, the
technomantic device emits a blast of steam in a 30-foot cone.
Creatures within the cone must make a DC 10 Constitution saving
throw, taking 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much
on a successful one. Recharge 5-6.
RECHARGE: The Steamblast has Recharge 5-6. This means that
after it has been used the first time, you should roll 1d6 each
round. If you roll a 5 or 6, Asuvius can use the Steamblast
again.
Someone in the perch can take an action to attempt a DC 14
Intelligence (Arcana) check to figure out how the controls work. On
a success, they can take an action to shut down the initiation
sequence for the steampowered construct or use bonus actions to
cancel or reassign targets (and set target priority).
Alchemical Nests: On the back side of the perch (where they
can’t be seen from the entrances), there are three alchemical
nests. Each nest is an oval-shaped concavity filled with
alchemical fluids. In one of them is nestled an elemental seed.

Elemental Seed: A DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that
the glowing pod is infused with powerful elemental forces of
earth and fire. These appear to be similar to the elemental forces
found in mephits.
GM Note: These nests are used by Asuvius to bring the elemental
seeds to “term,” at which point they split open and hatch a
mephit. By controlling the alchemical mixture, Asuvius can
control what type of mephit emerges.
STEAMPOWERED CONSTRUCT
After someone on the technomantic perch begins the activation
sequence, it takes five rounds for the steampowered construct to

come online. Once online, it will attack whatever targets have been
indicated by the controls on the perch.
FORESHADOW THE CONSTRUCT
Don’t wait until the steampowered construct has fully activated
to roll initiative for it. Each round, on its initiative count,
describe how it’s “booting up”—the ratcheting sound of its
gears spinning; its eyes begin to glow; it emits little bursts of
steam from its joints.
STEAM PIPE
The brass pipe crossing the geode is fitted with several valves.
Breaking the pipe (AC 16, 10 HP) will cause steam to burst out,
filling a 10-foot-square area. Fiddling with the valves will similarly
cause steam to vent 1d4-1 rounds later (on a result of 0, it happens
immediately). In either case, characters in the area suffer 4d6 fire
damage (DC 16 Dexterity saving throw for half damage).
GM Note: The steam pipe originates in Area 3, passing through
Areas 5 and 7 before arriving here.
TREASURE
Asuvius is carrying a small pouch containing 157 silver pieces (sp),
34 gold pieces, and 200 gps’ worth of helenite gem-coins (a green
gemstone currency used by magmin, created by baking volcanic
dust and ash in a furnace with glass).

STEP 3: HOW TO RUN
A DUNGEON

You’re a dungeon master now!
Or, if you’re reading ahead, you will be soon.
In running your first adventure, you’ve used a very simple
structure of rulings and rooms. Simple, but powerful. There’s a lot
you can do with just rulings and rooms. I’ve run entire campaigns
using nothing but rulings and rooms.
So far we’ve focused on the classic dungeon scenario: the
underground labyrinth filled with traps and treasure. But the basic
structure of a dungeon scenario, also known as a dungeon crawl,
can be used to run a lot of different adventures, such as
a haunted mansion,

a smuggler’s warehouse,

a half-sunken shipwreck,

a transdimensional maze,

the skull of a dead god, or
a zombie-ravaged inn.

What will your next adventure be? That’s entirely up to you!
Although there are other published scenarios you could purchase
and run for your players, RPGs are designed for you to create your
own. It’s fun to do this, and it gives you the opportunity to
customize your adventures to the stuff that your players enjoy and
want to do. You can create literally anything you can imagine.
That’s the whole point!
CAMPAIGNS
The heroes have gone on an adventure. With that adventure
done, what happens next? Another adventure! The sequence or
collection of adventures the PCs play through is referred to as a
campaign. Kind of like how a TV series is made up of many
episodes, an RPG campaign is made up of many scenarios.

Before we get down to creating your first dungeon, though, we’re
going to start expanding the simple rulings-and-rooms structure by
adding a dungeon procedure. Over the next several chapters, we’ll
be looking at a lot of new options and fun twists for how dungeons
can be built and played. These new options, of course, will add
complexity. The more complexity you add, the easier it will be to
become confused, overwhelmed, or simply lose track of stuff. A
procedure will help you manage the complexity by organizing it
into a semi-formal sequence.
When you were running your first adventure, for example, you
were actually following a very simple procedure:
1. Track the movement of the PCs.
2. When they enter a room, describe it to them.
When they were done doing stuff in the room, they’d pick an exit
and you’d go back to your procedure. It’s just a different way of
thinking about rooms and rulings, right?
To take the next step, though, you’ll want to start using a
dungeon turn.

THE DUNGEON TURN

A dungeon turn is kind of like a turn in any other game: Everyone
gets a chance to do something, you resolve the outcome while
keeping an eye on anything else that needs to be tracked, and then
you start a new turn and do it again.
During each dungeon turn, you’ll do the following:
1. Mark ticks (to track time, resources, etc.).
2. Make an encounter check.
3. Declare actions.
4. Make Perception-type checks as necessary.
5. Resolve actions, including tracking movement on the map.

A dungeon turn lasts roughly 10 minutes in the game world, but
this is best understood as a fairly amorphous figure. For example,
what if the party moved 150 feet during the last dungeon turn, but
they moved only 50 feet this turn before reaching a point of interest
where they wanted to do something else (and, therefore, started a
new turn)? Don’t sweat it. One of the reasons we use dungeon turns,
in fact, is to average this sort of stuff out into a “good enough”
approximation.
On a similar note, you may sometimes find it useful to really
formalize this procedure, explaining to the players exactly how the
dungeon turns work and systematically collecting their action
declarations each turn. For example, let’s say you ask your
characters to mark one tick for every turn they use their lit torches.
That might look like this during actual play:
JASON (DM): Okay, it’s a new turn. Tick your torches.
SETH (RANTHIR): My torch has burned out.
JASON (DM): What is everyone doing?

SETH (RANTHIR): Well, I’m lighting a new torch.
JASON (DM): That’s an incidental action. What’s your dungeon
action?
SETH (RANTHIR): I’m going to cast detect magic and Search the
statue.
DAVE (AGNARR): I’ll stay by the door we came in and be the
Lookout.
SARAH (TEE): I’ll pick the lock on the opposite door.

And so forth.
This can work fine, and there are likely many situations in which
it might be the best way to handle things. (Particularly if you’re just
getting started and trying to get a grip on how dungeon turns work.)
But it can also lead to very stilted forms of play:

JASON (DM): Okay, you’ve gone another 100 feet down the
passage. That ends this turn. Now what?
PREETI (ELESTRA): We continue walking down the corridor.

JASON (DM): Okay, you’ve gone another 100 feet. New turn. Now
what?
This sort of thing can make the dungeon turn more of a liability
than a useful tool. Personally, I find the dungeon turn most useful as
a tool that the DM can privately use to organize and keep track of
things without the players being aware of it. I refer to these as
player-unknown structures: They leave the players free to interact
directly and naturally with the game world, while giving the DM the
tools they need behind the screen to keep that world running
smoothly.
When you’re using a dungeon turn as a player-unknown structure,
you’re more likely to end up with play that looks like this:
JASON (DM): As you enter the room, Ranthir’s torch starts to
sputter. Looks like it’s about to go out.
SETH (RANTHIR): I’ll pull out a new one.

Jason makes a note about the new torch. He knows that lighting
the torch is an incidental action (see here), so Ranthir is still free
to do something more substantial during this dungeon turn.
JASON (DM): Great. Now what?

SETH (RANTHIR): I’m going to cast detect magic and see if there’s
anything weird about that statue.

JASON (DM): What’s everyone else doing while Ranthir is doing
that?

DAVE (AGNARR): I’ll stay by the door and keep an eye out for
any trouble.
SARAH (TEE): I’ll pick the lock on the opposite door.

The question, “What’s everyone else doing while so-and-so does
that?” is a very powerful tool. It prompts an action declaration, but
also encourages everyone to get involved instead of just watching
from the sidelines. Dungeon turns cover big chunks of time, so
there’s plenty of room for everyone to actively engage with the
situation.
TRACKING ALL THAT ACTION
Keeping track of what four or five different players have said they’re
doing can be tricky. One option is to jot down a quick note, then
just work through the list you’ve made resolving in whatever order
makes the most sense.
Alternatively, you don’t have to collect the full list. You can resolve
as you go. For example, Jason could tell Ranthir what he sees with
his detect magic spell and then ask everyone else what they’re
doing. The important thing is to make sure everyone gets a turn! It
can be surprisingly easy to just keep resolving stuff with Ranthir, for
example, and forget that the other PCs have all frozen in place
because you’ve forgotten about them.

DUNGEON RUNNING SHEET

On page 71 you’ll find the Dungeon Running Sheet. You can make
copies of this sheet and use it for your own dungeon adventures, but
it’s also easy to duplicate its functionality using a sheet of scratch
paper.
Party Name provides a convenient label for the sheet. This might
be the “Red Elks” or the “Cabal of Black Night” or just the
“Thursday Night Group.”
Turn Tracker gives multiple slots for tracking effect durations. Its
use is described in more detail under “Ticks,” on page 72.

Marching Order provides a template for tracking the current or
standard positioning of the PC. Each square is a 5-foot square on the
map, allowing you to easily list relative positions that can be
directly transferred onto a battlemap. The template provides space
for the PCs to travel three across, but can easily be used for singlefile lines or 10-foot-wide corridors (where the PCs can only walk
two abreast).
You should ask your players what their marching order will be—
i.e., who’ll be in front, who’ll be in the middle, who’ll be at the
back, etc.—at the beginning of the session and write it down here.
Whenever the PCs are moving through the dungeon, you can simply
assume that this will be their relative positioning and use it to
adjudicate outcomes accordingly (who triggers traps, who’s in a
position to spot the ambush, and so forth). You may find that you
and your players start referring to a “standard marching order,”
diverging from it only when special circumstances make it
necessary. This saves a lot of time and busywork at the table and
lets you focus on more interesting stuff in the game world.
If the PCs are journeying into a dark environment (which is
hardly unheard of when it comes to dungeons), it can also be a good
idea to determine which PCs are carrying light sources and indicate
these on the marching order. I recommend a simple symbol, such as
, and you might also find it useful to indicate the range of the
light for easy reference. So a torch, for example, would be
20/40
(meaning bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light out to 40
feet).
Here’s an example of what a completed marching order looks like:

The Movement section of the running sheet includes three slots.
Party Speed is almost always equal to the speed of whichever party
member is the slowest. The group’s Dungeon Pace is equal to the
party’s speed x 5 (see the Movement dungeon action, page 77, for
details). Finally, Fast Pace is equal to the party’s speed x 100.

TICKS
Items and spells have durations. You’ll want to track these
durations so that you’ll know when they come to an end in the
game world.
Using your running sheet, simply list each effect and its duration
in dungeon turns. At the beginning of each dungeon turn, mark each
track with a tick. When the number of ticks equals the duration, the
effect expires.
It’s your choice at what point during the turn the effect expires,
but more often than not it will be easiest to describe it at the
beginning of the turn when you mark the tick.
I recommend making your ticks in pencil. When Ranthir’s torch
burns out, for example, he’ll likely want to immediately light a new
one. Instead of starting a new line, you can just erase the current
ticks and start over.
If you’re using a running sheet with preprinted ticks, like the one
in this book, then there are a couple more tricks you might find
useful. (You can also use graph paper to this effect.)
First, when starting a new track you can mark the spot on the
track where the duration expires. You could circle it, for example:

Now you don’t have to keep counting ticks to see if you’ve
reached the duration. Once you’ve reached the indicated tick, you
know the torch or spell or trap timer has expired.
Alternatively, instead of marking multiple tracks each turn, you
can make the top track on your sheet a master track. The master
track is ticked each turn, as usual. On the other tracks, however,
you indicate duration relative to the master track tick. (So if the
current master track is on tick 7 and a new torch with a duration of
six dungeon turns is lit, you’d indicate that its duration ends on tick
13.) Each time you tick the master track, simply scan down the
column to see which effect ends.

Your master track will likely fill up at some point: Simply erase
the track or start a second master track in the first available slot and
cycle the duration indicators appropriately.
SHORT EFFECTS
Some effects, of course, have a duration shorter than a dungeon
turn. For example, a bless spell only lasts for up to 1 minute.
You don’t need to track these. Or, at least, you don’t need to
track them using dungeon turns.
LONG EFFECTS
Other effects are quite long. A lantern, for example, can burn
for 36 turns. For these long timers, it can be good practice to
periodically update the players on its status. So, for example,
you could make an additional duration mark at every 12 turns
for the lantern, making a point of mentioning how much oil has
been depleted as you hit those milestones. This not only helps
manage the length of your duration track for these longer
items, it also helps the players feel the passage of time in the
game world.

ENCOUNTER CHECK

The dungeon turn is a looping procedure. Within that loop, the
process of generating a random encounter is its own little miniprocedure. Let’s break this encounter procedure down into its
specific steps:
1. Make an encounter check by rolling 1d8. A roll of 1 indicates
that an encounter will occur.
2. Roll on the dungeon’s random encounter table to determine the
random encounter. (You can see an example table on the next
page.)
3. Determine the encounter distance by rolling 2d6 x 10 feet.

4. Make a reaction check by rolling 2d6 and consulting the
reaction table (on the next page).
5. Determine surprise, if any. In D&D, this will usually be done with
opposing Dexterity (Stealth) and Wisdom (Perception) checks.
EXAMPLE: ENCOUNTER TABLE
D10

ENCOUNTER

1–3

1d4 + 4 goblins

4–5

1d2 giant spiders

6–7

1d4 goblins + 1 giant spider

8

Ogre

9

Ettercap

Roll again twice, combine the
encounters.

Amiable

If an encounter is indicated, the encounter you generate using the
encounter procedure should appear at some point during the
dungeon turn.
Running a successful random encounter can be tricky. We’ll take a
closer look at some of the best practices in Running Random

Encounters on page 80.

DUNGEON ACTIONS

During each dungeon turn, each PC can take one dungeon action.
Not everything a PC does in the dungeon should be considered a
dungeon action. Some of the things players say their characters are
doing will be considered incidental actions. Incidental actions
happen during the dungeon turn, often at the same time that the
character is doing their dungeon action. Examples of incidental
actions include:
talking while doing other tasks

minor amounts of movement, up to a character’s speed

a quick item interaction (e.g., lighting a torch, pulling a switch, or
opening an unlocked door)
anything else that isn’t time-consuming

At your discretion, if characters are taking a whole bunch of
incidental actions all at once, you can declare that the
amalgamation is equivalent to a full dungeon action. For example,
opening an unlocked chest would normally be an incidental action.
Checking 50 chests to find the missing travel documents? That’s
probably chewing up a full turn. Same thing if they’re chatting for a
bit, then opening a chest, then walking to the far side of the room,
then checking out the mural on the wall, then appraising the value
of the mithril sconces, and then … and then … and then …
Somewhere in there they’ve spent 5 to 10 minutes doing all that
miscellaneous stuff and you should feel free to start a new dungeon
turn.
If players are aware of the dungeon turn structure, they may
declare specific actions. If you’re running the dungeon turn as a
player-unknown structure, then you’ll be interpreting the players’
declarations conceptually through the dungeon actions.

JASON (DM): You’ve reached a T-intersection. About 40 feet to
your left you can see a door made from gold; it glints in the
light from Agnarr’s flaming sword. To the right, at about the
same distance, there’s a plainer door of weatherworn oak.
The group has been marching down the corridor, using a Movement
action.
SARAH (TEE): Let’s head toward the gold door, but I want to
check the last 20 feet for traps.
They still had 40 feet of distance left in their Movement action, so
even after the navigational decision, Jason still counts this
additional movement as part of the same Movement action. He
then starts a new dungeon turn with Tee taking the Search action.
JASON (DM): Okay, you head a little closer to the door and then
Tee gives the hand signal for everyone else to stop where they
are. Tee, give me an Intelligence (Investigation) check.
While Sarah makes her check, Jason marks ticks and makes an
encounter check for the current turn. The check is negative, so no
monsters appear.
JASON (DM): What is everyone else doing while Tee checks the
hall?

DAVE (AGNARR): I’ll actually hold back at the intersection. Play
rear guard.
Even though Dave hasn’t explicitly said he’s taking the Lookout
action (see here), that’s clearly what Agnarr is doing, and so
Jason counts that as Agnarr’s action for this turn and resolves it
accordingly.
JASON (DM): Okay, give me a Wisdom (Perception) check.

SETH (RANTHIR): I’ll take the time to read a few more pages of
Sagrathea’s journal.
Reading an enigmatic sorcerer’s diary isn’t covered by a specific
dungeon action, but it’s clearly a time-consuming activity and,
therefore, not an incidental action. It’s an Other Action (see here)
and Jason counts it as Ranthir’s action for the turn.
Either way, it won’t be unusual for the PCs to all be doing the
same action, particularly when movement is involved (e.g., the
whole group walks down the hall together in marching order). You
can usually just roll with this; there’s no need to bog things down by
checking with every single player every single time to make sure
they’re still moving with the group.
It’s also quite possible that some or all of the PCs will choose to
just stand around and wait while other PCs are doing stuff. While
you want to give everyone an opportunity to participate, it’s just
fine if they choose not to. If you’re feeling charitable, you might
assume such characters are on Lookout. Alternatively, when it feels
appropriate, you may want to ask them if they want to Help the PCs
who are taking action.
DUNGEON ACTIONS
Movement

Combat
Conversation
Helping

Lookout

Overcome Obstacle
Ritual Casting

Other Actions

DUNGEON ACTION: MOVEMENT
Characters can move up to their dungeon pace (which is speed x 5)
in one dungeon turn. At these distances, usually all of the characters
will be moving together, and you can assume they’re simply moving
at the party’s dungeon pace.
Characters can perform incidental movement while performing
other dungeon actions. If you need a rule of thumb, assume a
character can move up to their speed before the movement requires
a full dungeon turn.
The calculation for dungeon pace assumes that the characters are
exploring the environment: examining their surroundings,
discussing their options, making notes, updating their map,
hesitating before making navigational decisions, and so forth.
If characters are simply trying to move as quickly as possible
through an area they’re familiar with, they can travel at a fast pace
(speed x 100). While doing so, they suffer disadvantage on
Perception and Stealth checks; they also cannot map or take notes.
It’s generally not possible to move at a fast pace through unfamiliar
tunnels, although there may be exceptions at your discretion.
DUNGEON ACTION: COMBAT
When a fight breaks out in the dungeon, Combat becomes the
dungeon action for all combatants during that dungeon turn. In
effect, this just means that a new dungeon turn begins when combat
wraps up (so mark your ticks, make a fresh encounter check, and so
forth).
COMBAT & LOUD NOISES
If the PCs are being particularly noisy—and combat would certainly
qualify!—you may choose to make an additional encounter check
for the turn, representing the increased likelihood of other denizens
being drawn to the disturbance.
DUNGEON ACTION: CONVERSATION

Talking as an incidental action is obviously common no matter what
the PCs are doing, but sometimes the party hunkers down for a
lengthy debate about what their next course of action should be. A
long conversation like this should probably be counted as a dungeon
action, so where’s the line?
Basically, just look at the clock: Have the players been talking for
about 10 minutes or so? Then it’s time to start a new dungeon turn:
Make your ticks and checks.
DUNGEON ACTION: HELPING
Characters can Help the actions of their allies. In some cases, this
just means that both characters are taking the action (e.g., they’re
each searching a different section of a particularly large room). In
other cases, the helper will grant advantage to the character they’re
helping.
DUNGEON ACTION: LOOKOUT
A character on Lookout is focused on observing their surroundings,
usually keeping an eye out for anything dangerous. Characters on
Lookout make Perception-type checks normally, whereas characters
taking other non-Movement dungeon actions suffer disadvantage on
their Perception-type checks due to distraction.
DUNGEON ACTION: OVERCOME OBSTACLE
Opening an unlocked door is easy enough and would be considered
an incidental action, but if the door is locked or stuck, it becomes a
more significant obstacle. Examples of overcoming such obstacles
can include:
picking a lock

forcing open a door
disabling a trap

climbing out of a pit trap
moving a heavy log
solving a riddle

repairing an object
Ultimately, where the line lies between getting hit by an arrow
trap (instantaneous and probably best considered an incidental
action resolved as part of a larger dungeon turn) and puzzling out
the precise pattern of steps required to cross a booby-trapped
mosaic floor through trial and error by throwing a heavy weight
around (probably a full dungeon action) is a ruling for you to make.
DUNGEON ACTION: RITUAL CASTING
Some spells, and all spells that are ritually cast, have a casting time
of 10 minutes. Casting any such spell is a dungeon action.
DUNGEON ACTION: SEARCH
Characters can search a typical room or up to 50 feet of hallway as a
dungeon action. Colossal rooms may, at your discretion, require
multiple actions to search fully.
DUNGEON ACTION: OTHER ACTIONS
This list of dungeon actions should cover most activities in the
dungeon, but it’s hardly encyclopedic. If a PC takes an action that
feels like it should take at least 5 or 10 minutes, that probably
counts as a dungeon action. Handle it as such.

DUNGEON PERCEPTION

You don’t need to make Perception-type checks every single turn
(that would quickly become mind-numbing and monotonous), but
the question of who sees what and when they see it is so pervasive
in the dungeon—happening so often as part of another action—that
it’s worthwhile to call it out as its own step in our dungeon
procedure.
In D&D, these checks will usually be Wisdom (Perception) or
Intelligence (Investigation) checks, but could also include Wisdom
(Survival), Wisdom (Insight), or any number of knowledge checks
depending on the current situation.

Remember that Perception-type checks are resolved normally by
characters Moving at dungeon pace or taking the Lookout action. All
other characters make Perception-type checks with disadvantage
due to distraction.

RUNNING RANDOM ENCOUNTERS

The encounter procedure detailed previously should give you all the
raw material you need to run a random encounter, but there’s a
great deal of art that can go into playing the encounter to its best
effect.
The key thing is that the function of the random encounter is to
keep the world in motion. While running Mephits & Magmin, you may
have noticed how all the bad guys politely waited in their room for
the PCs to show up. In fact, if the PCs ever stopped and just waited
around somewhere in that adventure, they would never be
disturbed. It’s as if the monsters were all freeze-framed until the PCs
walked through the door.
Now, this rarely causes a big, dramatic problem. The illusion
usually works and the players, more often than not, probably won’t
notice the conceit. But it can be a lot more fun if the dungeon feels
like a real place with creatures on the prowl and evil cultists going
about their business! It can immerse the players more deeply in the
world, ratchet up the tension (you never know who might walk
around the corner!), and force creative problem-solving.
Random encounter checks are the easiest mechanism you can use
for making a dungeon feel alive like this: They can simulate
everything from daily routines to regular guard patrols, allowing
you to stay tightly focused on running the current room (instead of
trying to juggle the entire dungeon all at once) while the dungeon
nevertheless continues to pulse and thrum with life.
Life. That’s a really important concept here. Where random
encounters can fail is when they’re reduced to nothing more than
the bare bones of the procedure: Roll dice. Random monsters walk

through the door. The PCs stab them a bunch. The game continues
as if the encounter had never occurred.
Random encounters are a form of procedural content
generation. The term comes from computer gaming. There it refers
to the programmatic creation of content—a procedure
algorithmically generates data that would otherwise need to be
manually created. For example, instead of having a human
developer place every tree in a forest, you can instead have the
program follow a certain set of rules and place all the trees in the
forest for you. You can see how the same concept applies here: Our
procedure (i.e., the encounter check) generates content (i.e., the
creatures) and we inject that content into our game.
In a computer game, there are some fairly severe limitations to
procedural content generation. Although these systems get better
every year, they tend to create carbon-copy results and can often be
rife with logical problems. They lack the “human touch.”
The great thing about a roleplaying game, of course, is you. As the
DM, you, unlike a computer game programmer, are sitting right
there at the table. You can—and must!—take the raw material
provided by our simplistic procedural content generator and give it
the human touch, investing it with your rational judgment and
unbridled creativity.
When our random encounter procedure generates 1d4 + 4
goblins, for example, the 1d4 + 4 goblins are not the encounter. The
encounter is what you do with those goblins. The 1d4 + 4 goblins
are just the improv seed that you get to riff off of.
For example, when you roll up those 1d4 + 4 goblins, you might
decide that:
They’re Orcus worshippers who have all flayed the skin from their
right hands, leaving a motile skeleton that remains animate even
after the goblins have died.
They’re religious zealots who have been converted to the worship
of Apollo and preach about the “glorious scourge of sunlight” to
fellow travelers.

Three of the goblins are being attacked and brutalized by the
others; the victims will beg for help from the PCs.

They’re mercenaries who are looking for a good paycheck. Are the
PCs hiring?
You can see how each of these is not only a completely different
encounter—every version of “1d4 + 4 goblins” can be unique—but
that each encounter is deeply infused with life.
To find this life in your own encounters, you need to
contextualize the encounter. The procedure has generated
something random. It’s your job to explain why it isn’t. You want to
connect this encounter to the current environment and situation of
the PCs. This will also connect the encounter to the scenario,
making it a significant part of the game instead of irrelevant fluff
that’s just chewing up table time.
When you roll up an encounter, ask yourself four questions:
1. What makes these monsters unique?
2. Where are they coming from?
3. What are they doing?
4. How do they react to the PCs?
These answers do not need to be elaborate or some Herculean feat
of jaw-dropping creativity. They don’t even need to be full
sentences. It only takes a little nudge to make the encounter specific
and interesting (instead of generic and boring).
WHAT MAKES THE MONSTERS UNIQUE?

Appearance (scars, hair-/scale-style, clothing, size)
Rank (lieutenants vs. galley cooks)

Distinctive Ability (special power, magic item)

Behavior/Personality (unusual vulnerability or hostility)

Visible Treasure (large amulet, bejeweled diadem, bulging coin
purse, etc.)
WHERE ARE THEY COMING FROM?
This obviously depends on the scenario you’re running, so take a
look at your dungeon map. Broadly speaking, you can either think
in terms of where monsters of this type are keyed (e.g., this
encounter is with goblins and goblins are keyed to Area 8, so that’s
where these goblins are coming from) or somewhere nearby (so
look at rooms near the PCs’ current location for inspiration).
It’s also possible that the encounter is coming from outside the
current scenario. For example, these might be goblins from another
tribe who have just arrived with a giant riding spider that they’re
delivering to the local tribe.
Either way, where the encounter is coming from is also informed
by what their destination is, and that’s usually connected to the next
question …
WHAT ARE THE MONSTERS DOING?
The possibilities here are almost limitless, and the more specific you
can make it to the scenario the better.
Working guard patrol

Escorting prisoners or valuables
Moving raw goods or supplies
Performing a ritual

Heading home for the night or going to work
Running an errand

Delivering a message

Going to meet someone
Eating or relaxing

Crafting or mining
Singing songs

Training

Performing an experiment

Building or expanding the dungeon

What they’re doing also helps determine where they’re going,
which generally takes one of four forms:
Passing by (e.g., the PCs are in a room and the encounter is
walking down the hall outside)

Passing through (e.g., they’re going to walk through the room
the PCs are in)

Coming to the PCs (which means that whatever they’re doing is
in this room)

Remaining stationary (the encounter is doing something in a
room or hall that the PCs are approaching, so the PCs come to the
encounter rather than vice versa)
This also means you can flip this around: If you’re trying to figure
out what the encounter is doing, just look at where the PCs are (and
the rooms near them) and ask yourself what the encounter would be
doing there. For example, if the PCs are in the kitchen, it’s more
likely the goblins are coming to grab some food.
Also: Have the PCs done anything that could explain what the
encounter is doing here?

Has there been a fight recently? Then maybe the noise attracted
the encounter. Did they fail a Stealth check earlier? Maybe the
encounter is following their tracks. Did they leave a bunch of bodies
lying around? Then the encounter might be actively searching for
them or heading to the armory to get geared up.
Connecting random encounters to the actions of the PCs is a great
way of showing them how their actions have consequences (and,
therefore, that their choices are meaningful) while simultaneously
grounding that encounter in such a specific context that it doesn’t
feel random at all.
USING ENCOUNTER DISTANCE
An easy habit to fall into, when an encounter check indicates a
random encounter, is to simply say, “You see a monster and the
monster sees you; roll initiative.” There are a lot of variations
of this—the monster opens a door, the PCs open the door, the
monster walks around the corner, etc.—but they all boil down
to the same thing.
The encounter distance check can help you break this habit by
prompting easy alternatives.
Is the distance farther than the current line of sight (e.g., the
monster must be outside the room)? Make appropriate
Perception and Stealth tests to see if the monster notices the
PCs, the PCs notice the monster, or both.

Is the distance closer than line of sight (e.g., the roll indicates
20 feet, but the PCs are in the middle of a 50-foot-square
room)? You can default to the logical line of sight (although
Stealth and Perception checks might still be appropriate),
but also ask yourself what else could explain the
discrepancy. (This is how you get moments like xenomorphs
climbing through ceiling panels.)
There may, of course, be times when this simple dice prompt
produces nonsensical results. It’s a good thing that you, as the

dungeon master, are right there to override it when necessary!
HOW DO THEY REACT TO THE PCS?
Not all encounters need to be combat encounters.
The reaction check in our encounter procedure is designed, in
part, to gently push us away from defaulting to combat.
Defaulting to combat is really common. I think we’re partly
influenced by video games where “stomp the Koopa” and “shoot the
cacodemon” is the default action. But on a more fundamental level,
it’s because combat is easy. Most RPGs include robust rules for
combat, including a very specific procedure for resolving it. Just
follow the procedure and the rules will take care of the rest.
(This is, ironically, also why combat has been a default action for
video games from Space Invaders to Call of Duty. It’s a lot easier to
implement a loop of combat mechanics than it is to run a unique
encounter.)
Punching somebody in the face (or stabbing them with a +2 longsword) is not, of course, the totality of human (or elven or even
Klingon) experience. But if everything reacts to the PCs walking into
a room by snarling and drawing their blades, then it can very easily
become so.
The reaction table (see here) provides a basic prompt you can use
to shape the initial moments of the encounter across a broad
spectrum of experiences, but it’s also a good example of a general
principle when it comes to procedural content generators: If you
already know what the answer should be, you don’t have to ask the
dice.
For example, if all the goblins in this tribe have sworn a blood
oath to slay the PCs and you roll up a random encounter with
goblins … well, you already know they’re going to be hostile, right?
(Although, for the sake of argument, you could still choose to roll
a reaction check and use a result of “Amiable” to suggest that these
goblins aren’t part of the hostile tribe: Maybe they’re visitors or

prisoners or dissidents. These are all tools for you to use; not for you
to be used by.)
On a similar note, the outcome of the reaction check is
deliberately vague. This is necessary because it can be applied to a
wide variety of intelligent, semi-intelligent, and unintelligent
creatures, but it’s also expected that you’ll use your creativity and
knowledge of the setting to make the general result specific. A
Hostile encounter, for example, might be a group of starving wolves;
slavers looking to capture the PCs; or a group of paladins who
mistakenly think the PCs are slavers.
The indicated reaction is also only a starting point. It’s possible
the encounter’s attitude won’t shift (“We fight to the death!”), but
there’s no reason, for example, that the PCs can’t convince the
paladins that they’ve made a mistake.
Where the encounter goes from there is entirely up to you (and
your players)!

RUNNING TRAPS

Traps are a staple of pulp adventure and a classic element of
dungeon adventures. Down in the dark places of the earth, there is
danger lurking everywhere. These hazards can take a wide variety
of forms.
Pit traps (spikes at the bottom optional)
Boulders chasing you down corridors
Ceilings collapsing

A fusillade of arrows shooting from the wall
Poison gas filling the chamber

Huge blades scything out of walls
Human-sized snares in the jungle

Poison needles jabbing those who unlock a chest
A bear trap snapping shut on your leg

A magical milieu unlocks even more fantastical varieties. In
addition to simply imagining the impossible, you can take almost
any spell in the rulebook and use it as the seed for a memorable
trap.
A lightning bolt lancing down the hall

A fireball that explodes when you open a door
A strange mist that charms all those within it

A monster summoned when you fail to pick a lock

Explosive runes when opening the wrong book
A room where gravity reverses

Floating bubbles that envelop and suffocate

Teleportation traps (sending you to places unknown)
A magical alarm alerting guardians

Traps are tricky, though, and I don’t just mean for the PCs.
Running a trap in a way that’s satisfying and entertaining for the
whole table can be a challenge. It’s a process that can be broken
down into three parts:
Finding the trap

Triggering the trap
Playing the trap

In order to find a trap, a player must declare that they’re actively
searching—i.e., taking the Search dungeon action. They might be
specifically looking for traps, but not necessarily. The default
method for resolving this in D&D would typically be an Intelligence
(Investigation) check, but players may come up with clever ideas, so
don’t be afraid to call for alternative checks or even default to yes if
it seems appropriate. (For example, the players might pour water on
the floor so that it would run down the seams around a covered pit
trap.)

If a PC isn’t actively searching, then you might allow successful
Perception-type checks to notice evidence of the trap’s existence—
scorch marks, an arrow sticking out of the wall, water pooling oddly
on the floor, bits of blasted bone scattered around, etc. This is trapsign and it may give the players an opportunity to realize their
danger and begin an active search (which can be resolved
normally).
SO PERCEPTIVE!
If a PC has an incredible success on their Perception-type test—e.g.,
rolling 10 points higher than the DC of a Wisdom (Perception)
check—you might still allow them to detect a trap even if they’re not
actively searching. The character is just that good!
If the PCs don’t detect a trap, then it’s quite likely that they will
trigger the trap. Broadly speaking, a trap will have either a
proximity trigger or an action trigger.
A proximity trigger can take a number of forms in the game
world: a magical alarm, a pressure plate on the floor, a trip wire, an
infrared sensor, etc. When a character passes through an area with a
proximity trigger, roll 1d4. On a roll of 1, the trap triggers.
This roll simulates the uncertainty of stepping on exactly the right
spot to activate the trigger. (Sometimes you step over the trip wire
thanks to dumb luck.) It also means, since you’ll roll for each
character separately, that it won’t always be the character at the
front of the party who triggers the trap, which creates some nice
variety and uncertainty in the game. (It’s even possible the entire
group will luck their way past a trigger, which can really surprise
them when they double back and—wham!)
A trap with an action trigger goes off when a specific action is
taken: a poison needle jabs you in the thumb when you try to open
a chest; the ceiling collapses when you open the false door;
lightning bolts crisscross the room if you pick up the jade idol. You

usually won’t make a check for these triggers; they’ll automatically
go off if anybody does the indicated action.
Finally, if a PC fails a check when searching for a trap, this
might also trigger the trap. Depending on the circumstances, you’ll
need to make a ruling on whether it definitely goes off, it doesn’t go
off, or there’s just a risk of it going off (i.e., rolling a 1 on a 1d4).
Whether the PCs find a trap or trigger a trap, that’s not the end of
the trap. Either way, you still need to play the trap.
The key thing here is that your description of the trap should not
be limited to its mechanical effect. Yes, the arrow trap will make a
+5 attack roll for 1d6 + 4 damage against all characters in the
hall. But where are the arrows coming from? The walls? The
ceiling? Are they shooting out of holes or through an illusory
surface? How is the trap being triggered? A trip wire? A pressure
plate? An alarm spell keyed to a magical rune inscribed on the
ceiling?
For example, if the PCs find a trap before it triggers—or if it resets
and can be triggered over and over again—they’ll likely want to
disarm or disable it. The rote mechanical resolution for disabling a
trap is to make a Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check. But if you
understand how the trap works, it will allow the players to get
creative with their work-arounds—to get their “Indiana Jones” on,
so to speak.
These work-arounds might include alternative skill checks
(perhaps made with advantage to reward clever thinking), or they
might bypass the mechanical resolution entirely: walking around a
pit trap, opening a trapped door from a distance with mage hand,
using a shield to block the arrow trap in the wall, or just commando
crawling under the line of fire.
Even when the players default to the rote mechanical resolution,
knowing how the trap works will still let you ask them how they’re
disabling it, or describe it yourself in narrating the resolution. When
they disable the pit trap, do they force it open? Do they nail a board
over the top of it? Do they wedge it with iron spikes so that it can
support their weight one at a time? The difference will matter if

they end up getting chased back down this hallway by goblins
riding spiders!
On the other hand, let’s say that the trap is triggered. The rote
resolution here is, once again, jumping straight to a mechanical
effect: You’ve stepped on the pressure plate, therefore make a
Dexterity saving throw or suffer damage.
But it can be more fun if you give the players a chance to react!
SARAH (TEE): I very slowly make my way down the corridor,
checking carefully for traps.
JASON (DM): Give me an Intelligence (Investigation) check.
SARAH (TEE): 8.

That’s a failure. There’s a fireball trap in the corridor activated by
a pressure plate. That’s a proximity trigger, so Jason rolls 1d4
and gets a 2. Tee has avoided the pressure plate. Jason rolls again
for Agnarr, the next person in the marching order, and this time
rolls a 1.
JASON (DM): Agnarr, as you’re following behind Tee, a section of
the floor depresses under your foot and you hear a sharp click.
What do you do?
DAVE (AGNARR): I freeze! Tee! I think you missed something!
JASON (DM): Okay. Nothing seems to happen.

SARAH (TEE): With a heavy sigh I come back and check out his
foot. Let’s see if I can figure out what Agnarr has stepped in this
time.
Giving players a trigger reaction like this can be effective even if
their proposed actions are likely to all be resolved the same way
(e.g., whether you’re diving for cover or hitting the deck, you’re
probably making a Dexterity saving throw). Sometimes they’ll
surprise you, but even if they don’t, you’ll still end up with a scene
that is more vividly detailed and with which the players are more
actively engaged.

Another way of doing this is to design traps with ongoing effects,
which can turn the environment into a challenge or puzzle. (“Okay,
so we’ve accidentally hit a switch that is periodically blasting the
entire hallway with fire. How do we get to the other side?” or
“Ranthir has been knocked out by sleeping gas and anyone entering
the room is likely to also get knocked out. So how do we get him
out?”)
It can also be really effective to combine traps with monsters,
either to create a dynamic environment for the fight or to give the
monsters a unique tactical advantage (e.g., if they know where the
traps are located and can trigger them to wreak havoc with the
PCs).
HOW NOT TO RUN A TRAP
Here’s how you should NOT run traps in your game:
Use passive Wisdom (Perception) to determine if they spot a
trap.
Make an Intelligence (Investigation) check to see if the
character can figure out how to disable it.

Make a Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check to determine if they
disable the trap.
If any of the checks fail, the trap is triggered and inflicts a
random amount of damage.

The problem with this sequence is that at no point did the
players make an interesting choice. Or any choice at all. It’s an
entirely automatic sequence of mechanical interactions that the
players don’t even choose to initiate.

TEN-FOOT POLES
A common anti-trap tactic is to use a 10-foot pole to probe the
ground ahead. This has the normal 1 in 4 chance of triggering

proximity traps (but hopefully at a safe distance). It has the
advantage over normal searching in that it can be done as part
of the Movement action, although it does impose disadvantage
on Stealth checks (since the tap-tap-tapping of the pole isn’t
exactly discreet).
Your players may propose similar “be cautious without actively
searching” approaches. Sometimes these are still best handled
using the Search dungeon action. In other cases, some variation
of this 10-foot-pole procedure can probably be employed.

NEXT STEPS

To recap, our big focus here was adding a dungeon procedure to
help you keep track of everything while running the dungeon. This
included structures for keeping track of time and juggling the PCs’
actions, but the random encounters are the really big add-on.
In fact, if you want to keep things simpler, you might consider
skipping the random encounter checks for your next adventure. Get
comfortable with the rhythms of dungeon actions and keeping track
of time, then bring in the random encounters when you’re ready to
make your dungeons more exciting.
Speaking of the next adventure, that’s your next step in becoming
a dungeon master! In the next chapter, we’ll walk through the
process of creating your first dungeon adventure. Once it’s ready to
go, you can use everything you’ve learned so far to run it for your
players and continue their campaign.
If you’d like, it’s actually not a bad idea to do that several times,
designing additional adventures and continuing to run them as you
grow more comfortable in your role as the DM. There’s no rush.
After all, as we’ve discovered, there’s really no limit to the number
of adventures you can have with nothing more than a simple
dungeon.
When you’re ready to expand the scope of your adventures, we
can begin exploring Advanced Dungeons together, starting on page

HOMEWORK

DESIGN A DUNGEON
Are you ready to design your first adventure?
I promise you that you are, even if it doesn’t feel like it right now.
The great thing about a dungeon scenario is that it ultimately boils
down to just two essential elements:
The dungeon map
The dungeon key

And that’s it! That’s all you need! Whether you’re feeling excited
or trepidatious right now (or maybe a little bit of both), we’re going
to work through a simple step-by-step process for prepping your key
and map.
Of course, you’ve already used a key and map while running your
first scenario. So once you’re done making your own, you’ll already
be ready to run your adventure!

BRAINSTORMING YOUR DUNGEON

Should you start with your key or with your map?
This can be a kind of chicken-and-egg problem. If you start by
drawing the map, then you’re just kind of sketching random room
shapes and hoping that you’ll be inspired to fill them later. If you
try to start with the key, on the other hand, there’s the obvious

problem that you don’t actually have any rooms to describe yet.
This can naturally lead you to try doing them sort of both
simultaneously—maybe drawing a room and then keying it and then
drawing the next room—but I’ve found that this can be very
confusing in practice, and can lead to a lot of frustration when any
mistake on the map may precipitate erasing big chunks of your key
and vice versa.
So I like to start with a brainstorming session. This gives me the
freedom to experiment, steer clear of false starts, and lay out the
elements of the adventure in broad strokes before committing to the
specific details of map and key.
Let’s begin with the scenario concept. There are an infinite
variety of dungeon adventures you could design. What is the specific
dungeon that you’re designing today?
We can think of the scenario concept as being made up of the
dungeon’s location, denizens, and goal. To at least some extent,
these will all be connected to each other: If the PCs are hunting the
dwarven pirate Wee Willow Whipwater, it follows that the location
is likely to be her ship and its denizens will be her crew.
You may already have a concept in mind. If so, great! Use it as a
seed to flesh out the other two elements. Do you want to run an
adventure in a haunted house? Use that location to figure out who
lives in the house (owners and ghosts alike) and what the PCs’ goal
likely is (probably getting rid of the ghosts … unless the ghosts are
fine and it’s the owners who are the problem). Do you want to run
an adventure featuring giant ants? Then I’m guessing it’ll be set in a
giant anthill. (Now: What could motivate the PCs to visit the
anthill?) Do the PCs want to go explore the local mountain range?
What types of dangerous creatures might live in those mountains?
And where do they live?
If you don’t have a concept in mind, then I recommend focusing—
just momentarily—exclusively on either the location, the denizens,
or the goal. This will give you the initial seed and, as we’ve seen,
everything else can flow from that.

Denizens are a great place to find inspiration because there’ll
often be a big list of them in your RPG of choice. In D&D, for
example, you can just flip through the Monster Manual looking for a
cool illustration that catches your eye. In games that don’t have a
bunch of different creatures—like a game set in the real world, for
example—you can usually get a similar utility by looking at the
different factions in the setting instead.
THE CHALLENGE RATING MENU
In the Dungeon Master’s Guide there is a list of “Monsters by
Challenge Rating.” This is basically a menu that you can order
your scenario denizens from.
“Ah, yes, garçon. I’d like a killer whale with a swarm of
quippers on the side.”
There are a couple ways you can think about this. First, you
can think about who the big boss of your adventure might be.
For that, take a peek at the list of monsters with a challenge
rating equal to the PCs’ current level. Alternatively, you can
think about the horde. Who are the typical denizens in this
location whom the PCs are likely to meet in groups? For the
horde, you want to look at creatures with a challenge rating
lower than the PCs’ current level. (I usually go at least a couple
levels lower, because it gives me more flexibility in building
encounters.)
Instead of picking just one denizen when you’re looking for
inspiration, it can be even more effective to pick two. For example,
a ruined castle full of goblins can be fun, but what happens if you
pair those goblins with another creature?
goblins and ogres

goblins and blink dogs

goblins and tieflings

goblins and owlbears
Just reading through that list probably started sparking your
imagination. You can see what a clan of goblin blink-dog riders
looks like, and it’s completely different from a tribe of goblins
worshipping an ogre “god” or one with “sacred” bloodlines
descended from the demon lord Skarnak.
Putting two creatures together like this forces an act of creative
closure: We reflexively need to explain why these two creatures
coexist, and we instinctively create that explanation, closing the gap
between them by forging something thrillingly original.
Even better, the creative frisson will continue spinning out new
ideas, like radioactive isotopes knocked free during a nuclear
reaction: The opulent bedchambers of the Ogre God. The dark fane
dedicated to his worship. The heretic cages where disobedient
goblins are locked up until they repent. These provide raw fodder
for your dungeon key, filling it with cool rooms that will give your
adventure a unique identity.
Of course, the seed for your scenario concept can also come from
the location itself.
I find this often boils down to asking myself, “What would make
for a really cool map?” Or, to look at it from a slightly different
angle, “What would be a really cool place to explore?”
SAMPLE DUNGEON LOCATIONS
Cave

Ruins

Castle’s oubliette

Subterranean city

Crypt or catacombs
Mine

Mansion
Pyramid
Tower

Ship or shipwreck
Colossal body

City building or business
Security vault

Stronghold or fortress
Cliff dwellings

Treetop buildings

Subaquatic complex
Pocket dimension
Cloud cities
Prison

In a fantastical world, such locations are only limited by your
imagination. But if you’re looking for inspiration, it’s always worth
looking to the world around you: The megamall, with its cavernous
byways and twisting back corridors, transforms into a dwarven city.
What would your local library look like if the librarian was a
sorcerer? If you sunk your church beneath the earth, how would it
be transformed? Would its stained glass become phosphorescent
fungi? Take the real world, give it a fantastical twist, and you can
never be sure exactly where you’ll end up.
For me, personally, the third element of the scenario concept—the
goal—rarely serves as the font of inspiration when it comes to
adventure design. Your mileage may vary, though. Which is an
important point in itself, I think. What we’re talking about here is a
creative process, and creative processes are inherently personal
experiences. There’s no One True Way™, and you’ll probably find
your path to be a little different for every adventure you create.

As you start running a campaign, though, you may find that the
players are setting goals for themselves. They might ask questions
like, “Where did these magmin come from?” or say things like, “If
there’s one uraniac, there might be more. We need to figure out
what they’re up to.” This is a gift! You can just take their goal, add a
location and denizens (which are often strongly implied by the
goal), and have your next adventure.
If you’re looking for more generic goal-based brainstorming, then
I recommend magic items. They’re big and shiny and it’s usually
pretty easy to motivate the PCs to go after them just because they’re
awesome. Alternatively, you can also have the PCs get hired by
somebody who wants the item retrieved, whether just because
they’re a rich collector or because the item’s power naturally
suggests their motivation (e.g., “I need this ring of regeneration
because my daughter lost her leg in a terrible accident”). In D&D,
just like monsters, you’ve also conveniently got a huge list of magic
items that you can just scan through looking for inspiration.
A big ol’ pile of gold coins can also provide motivation, of course,
but the advantage of a magic item is that it can become an active
part of the scenario, with its powers combining with other elements
of the scenario to create a unique dungeon key. How are the goblins
using that ring of regeneration? Is it worn by their ogre lord to
reinforce his “divinity”? Do they use it in a grotesque ritual,
initiating their warriors by chopping off their limbs and having
them regrow? Items like demon armor or staff of fire can give a
unique twist to a boss fight, while others can explain
phantasmagorical alterations of the environment.
Now that we’ve sketched in our scenario concept, we’re going to
finish our brainstorming session by listing ideas for the individual
rooms in our dungeon.
One of the great things about a dungeon is that you can pour
almost any awesome idea you might have into a dungeon room.
It’s a very flexible scenario structure, so we’re free to imagine
almost anything. We’re not looking for fully fleshed out rooms,
though. Quite the opposite. We’re making a short, punchy list that’s

a mixture of cool ideas and stuff that “needs” to be in the dungeon.
Here’s a sample of what my brainstorming sheet looked like when
I was creating Mephits & Magmin:
lava canal

steampunk construct finale
crystals

broken basaltic floor

iridescent volcanic tunnel
inside a geode

mud mephits guarding the entrance
magmin “supercharging” mud mephits

inflationary rift, red hot glow oozing from crack across the top of
the dome
If we were to continue developing that idea of a blink dog–riders
adventure I mentioned on page 95, we could perhaps imagine a
goblin border fort and start making a list like this:
barracks

mess hall

upper levels accessible only by blinking
den mother’s cave
pup warrens

blink practice range
armory

taxidermied displacer beast
smithy

saddler specializing in blink tack
And so forth.

Don’t feel like you need to capture every single room that will (or
could) end up in the final dungeon. You’re capturing broad needs
and cool concepts. It’s not unusual for me to walk away from this
list, maybe grab a sandwich, and then come back with a fresh mind
to add more stuff to it. But when you feel like you’ve given yourself
a goodly bag of tricks, it’ll be time to move on to your map.
As you’re working on your brainstorming sheet, think about the
following questions:
What challenges need to be overcome to achieve the goal?

What logically needs to exist in this location? (e.g., where and
how do the monsters sleep?)
What cool things can the denizens do, and what environments
would make that even more fun?
What are some common features of a location like this? (e.g.,
castles have throne rooms and lava tubes have crystalline
growths.)
What fantastical twist could you apply to common rooms?

How might the special abilities (e.g., flight or fire immunity or
teleportation) create unique needs or alter the functions of
common rooms?
COMBINING IDEAS
Not everything on your brainstorming sheet needs to make it
into the final dungeon. The purpose of brainstorming, after all,
is to generate lots and lots of possibilities; to create a big supply
of raw ideas. An important part of the creative process is
refining those raw ideas, polishing them into something special.
Later in this chapter we’ll be creating a 5 + 5 Dungeon, a
simple recipe you can follow to create a great adventure.
Following this recipe, you will naturally boil your
brainstorming down, selecting the five or ten best ideas you
had for dungeon rooms. Even when you start designing larger

dungeons, though, it will still be a good idea to sort the wheat
from the chaff and focus on your best stuff.
Before you toss out the rooms that didn’t make the cut, though,
see if there’s a way to combine those ideas with the rooms you
chose. Remember that you want your rooms to have multiple
points of interest, and the interactions between different
elements—whether planned ahead of time or emerging from
the actions of the PCs—will add depth to the dungeon
experience. Rooms are cooler with combos.

MAPPING

All you need to make your own dungeon map is some paper and a
pencil. (Graph paper is ideal, but even that’s optional.)
Alternatively, there are a lot of different software tools you can
easily search for online and use for dungeon mapping, with options
ranging from the utilitarian to the opulent. This software is
particularly useful if you want to create a map that you can scale up
and use as a battlemap, either online or with miniatures at the table.

Whichever mapping method you choose, however, you’re going to
want to start simple. We’re going to sketch a connection map.
The basic idea is that, without worrying about precise
measurements or geometry, you’re laying out the rough
arrangement of the rooms and how they connect to each other. In
some cases, you’re not even concerned with individual rooms,
instead grouping rooms together that you know will be clustered in
the final dungeon and for which you’re primarily interested in how
that cluster will be linked to the rest of the complex.
Working with this sketchy connection map makes it a lot easier to
experiment, make mistakes, and shift things around. It’s not, of
course, a binding contract: As you begin working on your final map,
you’ll almost certainly find that stuff continues to shift and change
as you refine and hash out the details. But by figuring out the broad
strokes first, you’ll save yourself a lot of tears and wasted time later.
Once you’ve got everything in roughly the right place, you can
start work on the final map. Graph paper is your best option here,
and the first thing you’ll want to do is set a scale. For a dungeon,
you’ll generally want to use a scale of either 1 square = 5’ x 5’ area
(which will translate directly to a battlemap if you choose to use
one) or 1 square = 10’ x 10’ area (which will let you fit larger
complexes on a single sheet).
If your dungeon is a building or other structure, like a ship or the
body of a dead god, you may want to start by sketching in the
outline of the floorplan. More often than not, though, I’ll just pick a
spot on the page and start drawing: toward the center if the PCs are
entering via staircase; toward the edge if it’s the mouth of a cave or
the front door or something like that.
As you’re drawing, there are a lot of ways to make a map pretty,
but the most important thing, in my opinion, is getting a map that
works. For your walls, you don’t need anything more than simple
black lines, and you can use a handful of other simple symbols, as
shown in the Map Key Symbols on page 103, to add any additional
utility you might need.

Make sure to number your rooms. It’s generally good practice to
keep the numbers of rooms near each other in the dungeon close to
each other in the key, too, since it will make it easier to reference
things during play, but you can use whatever sequencing makes the
most sense to you.
Later, when you start making larger dungeons with multiple
levels, you may want to experiment with alternative numbers using
level prefixes—e.g., A-13, C-34, 4-46, 5-3, etc. These will, once
again, make it easier for you to reference your key during play. (It
also means that if you decide to add a new section to Level D, it
won’t cascade into your numbering on Level F.)
Once you start making dungeons with multiple levels, also make
sure to label your stairs and other level connectors, indicating
what level and room they go to. Believe me when I say that the last
thing you want to be doing in the middle of a session is flipping
through your maps, trying to figure out where the stairs on Level 3
go to.

KEYING

As you’re drawing, of course, you’ll be pulling the ideas from your
brainstorming sheet, creating the corresponding rooms, and adding
them to your maps. You’ll also likely be discovering new ideas as
you go! Putting pencil to paper and developing your sketchy
concepts into something concrete is going to get your creativity
flowing. Follow that flow, adding details to existing rooms or
entirely new rooms as the inspiration strikes you.
Either way, make sure you’re keeping notes. You might do this
directly on your brainstorming sheet or connection map, but while
mapping I’ll often have my laptop on the table next to me with the
dungeon key open in a word processor. I don’t recommend trying to
write down the full key as you map. I find it more rewarding to stay
focused on each task, and you’re likely going to be revising stuff as
you work on the map anyway. But what I will do is number the
rooms, transfer notes from my brainstorming documents, and jot
down any other details that occur to me while mapping.

This means that by the time I’m done mapping, I already have a
functional outline of the entire dungeon. The next step, of course, is
to fill in the key.
DUNGEON MAP KEY SYMBOLS

KEYING: DUNGEON ROOMS

While working on your dungeon key, use the format described in
The Anatomy of a Room on page 38, and shown in Mephits &
Magmin for each room:
The room’s name, a quick reminder of the room’s purpose and
content

Boxed text, an initial description of the room

Reactive skill checks, providing additional description in
response to a skill check
Room elements, describing contents of the room in detail

This format gives you a container to pour your ideas into and tries
to give you the tools to organize your notes so that they can be
easily referenced and used while playing the game. But you
shouldn’t feel constrained by it. For example, if there’s a room that
doesn’t have any reactive skill checks in it, don’t feel like you need
to force one in. You definitely don’t.
In keying the dungeon, it can be useful to think in terms of
featured rooms and scenic rooms. A good rule of thumb, in fact, is
to have a roughly even split between the two.
Featured rooms are the meat of the dungeon. They’re where
most of the action will be and where you’ll be putting most of your
coolest ideas. To design an awesome featured room, start by making

sure that it includes multiple elements—the stuff that either requires
or rewards the players for doing more than just looking at it.
I, personally, have a rule of thumb to include at least three
interactive elements. By including multiple elements you encourage
the group to split up and check out different stuff at the same time.

SETH (RANTHIR): I’m going to look through the papers on the
desk, see if I can figure out what they’ve been researching here.
SARAH (TEE): I’ll check out the chests. Make sure they’re not
trapped.

JASON (DM): Go ahead and give me an Intelligence
(Investigation) check for that. Dave, what’s Agnarr doing while
they do that?
DAVE (AGNARR): I’ll cautiously open the wardrobe.

It can be tempting to put just one cool thing in a room and
declare it done, but if each room only has one interactive element it
will often cause the group to default to having one character
become The Guy Who Checks Out the Room. (In D&D, it’s usually
the rogue.)
Not every single player needs to be engaged in every single room.
(That would be overkill, honestly.) But if you offer multiple options
in each featured room, break things up a bit, and get more people
involved, then over the course of the entire scenario it’s likely that
everyone at the table will feel engaged with the exploration of the
dungeon, and that will improve the experience for the whole table.
Not just because it’s fairer for everyone to have a turn but also

because it will give an opportunity for everyone to unleash their
creativity.
Scenic rooms, on the other hand, are the ones that basically
break this rule of thumb. They often don’t have any interactive
elements. If they do, then it’s probably just one that’s easily
resolved. They’re the rooms you look at and swiftly pass through on
your way to the featured rooms.
You can perhaps think of them as “empty rooms,” but I find this
label to be more deceptive than revealing. You might occasionally
have a legitimately barren chamber, but for the most part these
rooms aren’t boring. They can—and should!—still have cool stuff in
them, even stuff that’s of vital importance to the scenario. Examples
include
a fossilized dinosaur on display,

a tapestry revealing the history of the ruined monastery,

a trail of blood leading to a murder victim in the next room,
strange runes floating in midair, or

the invisible sensor of a clairvoyance spell.
These rooms offer a moment of appreciation or analysis, after
which the PCs can quickly move on, because while scenic rooms
aren’t necessarily empty, what they provide is negative space—a
contrast to the featured rooms; a moment of calm to emphasize the
frenetic chase; the unsurprising baseline that allows true surprise to
exist. If every time the PCs opened a door in the dungeon there was
something shocking or amazing behind it, the players would quickly
grow numb to the experience. You need the quiet to give meaning
to the loud, and that’s what scenic rooms offer.
AWESOME DESCRIPTIONS
Whether a room is featured, scenic, or maybe somewhere in
between, you’ll need to describe it. There are a few rules of thumb I
find useful when trying to create awesome descriptions.

Three of Five: Think about your five senses. Try to include at
least three of them in your descriptions. Sight is a gimme and Taste
will rarely apply (although sometimes you can taste the air), so that
means picking a couple out of Hearing, Smell, and Touch. (It can be
useful to remember that you don’t actually have to touch something
to intuit what it might feel like if you did. Touch can also include
things like wind and temperature.)
Including the full sensorium of the characters will help to
immerse the players in the game world. If you feel like getting
fancy, consider other senses, such as:
balance (vestibular sense)
movement (kinesthesia)

temperature (thermoception)
pain (nociception)

ultrahuman (provided by magic or technology; e.g., a detect magic
spell or night vision goggles)
You can get a lot of mileage here by just listing things in the scene
—a wardrobe, a bookshelf, a goblin—and dropping a descriptive tag
on each one while following the Three of Five rule.
Two Cool Details: Try to include two irrelevant-but-cool details.
These are details that aren’t essential to the encounter or room or
NPC, but are still nifty and distinct. It’s the broken cuckoo clock in
the corner, the slightly noxious odor with no identifiable source, the
graffiti scrawled on the wall, or the bioluminescent fungus.
These “superfluous” details help the world feel like a real place, a
place where people live and things exist that aren’t centered on the
PCs’ experience. Plus, you never know when a clever player will
find some insanely creative way to use these details to add
something truly special to the game.
Three-by-Three: By rule of thumb, each featured room should
have three elements. Describe each of those elements with at least
three details. (So it’s not just “a bookshelf.” It’s a “tall bookshelf in
the corner, its shelves crammed with scrolls and books.”)

For a scenic room, you can simplify this down a bit by just
including three details total—either of the room in general if it’s
relatively barren, or of its primary point of interest. Whatever
works.
More so than the other guidelines I’m suggesting here, this one is
likely to lead you astray if you treat it as too much of a holy
commandment. The point, though, is to get you into the ballpark of
effective detail. You want to take the generic (“there’s a bookshelf”)
and bring the world to life by helping the players to imagine a
specific bookshelf in a specific space. On the other hand, you don’t
want to overwhelm the players and exhaust them with needless
exposition. The three-by-three guideline encourages you to (a)
prioritize the most important elements of the room and (b) give
each of those elements the focus it deserves. Of course, there will be
the occasional epic room with more than three things you need to
establish, and maybe in those rooms you dial back the number of
details per element to keep your initial description manageable.
All of this is an art, not a science.
EXITS & DIMENSIONS
There are a couple of essential substrates when describing dungeon
rooms. First, you need to establish the size and shape of the room.
You’ll likely find that this needs to happen at or near the beginning
of your description, providing a blank slate that you—and your
players’ imaginations—will fill with each additional element you
detail.
The dimensions can be clinical (“The room is 40 feet long and 20
feet wide”), but this is often not required. “Large chambers,” “small
rooms,” and the like will be quite common. Sometimes you can get
away with establishing size in a more descriptive way—e.g., seeing
“a comfortable study” or “a typical bedroom” or “a modest kitchen”
will similarly cement the scene.
Although it doesn’t have to be mentioned every time, don’t forget
the third dimension: Have cramped, low ceilings and breathtaking
vaults that vanish into the darkness above the PCs.

Second, make sure you mention all the exits from the room.
Remember that the core structure of a dungeon adventure is to “do
stuff in a room until you run out of stuff to do, then pick an exit and
go to the next room.” It’s vital for the players to know what their
navigational choices are … and surprisingly easy to forget the doors
because you’re focused on all the cool stuff inside the room.
For clarity, I recommend grouping all the exits together (“There’s
a set of double doors on the far side of the room, an archway to the
right, and a little tiny door—only about three feet high—on your
left”). I’ve found it usually works best to either incorporate these
into the description of the room’s dimensions (“You see a large room
with a door on the opposite side”) or to list them at the end of your
description, where recency bias will help your players keep track of
their options.
KEEP IT PITHY
Having just dropped a big ol’ list of things to include in your
descriptions—cool details and exits and dimensions and three-bythree and three of five—it’s a good time to paradoxically point out
that length is your enemy when it comes to room descriptions.
Players have a limited attention span, they can only keep track of so
many things at one time, and, most importantly, they want to be
doing something, not listening to exposition. In fact, the more
effective and evocative your descriptions are, the more your players
will be champing at the bit to start doing stuff in response to them.
(That’s kind of the whole goal of an awesome room description.)
So keep it pithy. What you want is a handful of evocative images,
providing just enough seed and scaffold that the players will
perform creative closure and conjure the totality of the scene in
their own minds. (If I describe “bookshelves crammed with tomes
and scrolls,” I don’t need to describe every book. Each player will
fill those shelves all by themselves.) This not only prevents the
players from “tuning out” a long description, but the act of closure
itself will draw them into and immerse them in the game. They
become silent partners in the creation of the world, and thus
become invested in it and captured by it.

OUT OF THE BOX DESCRIPTIONS
The trap of boxed text is that it can create a subconscious belief that
you describe a room up front and then, after that, the players are
just taking actions within the pre-established environment.
But that’s an artificial dynamic. It’s much more effective to let the
details of the setting continue flowing through the description of the
action: the crunch of broken glass beneath their feet as they move
across the room. The coppery smell of blood as they draw near the
corpse. The sudden chill from the wind whipping through the
shattered window.
This can also be useful to keep in mind if you’re struggling to
keep your room descriptions pithy: The impulse to crowd too much
stuff into your boxed text is partly driven by a perceived need to
describe everything as thoroughly as possible. But once you realize
that the room’s description will continue beyond the boxed text, it
becomes a lot easier to say, “I’ll save this bit for later.”
Often you can include these additional details in your notes by
incorporating them into the interactive elements in the room.
THAT’S A LOT OF THUMBS
You may have noticed that the phrase “rule of thumb” got used
quite a bit while we’ve been discussing room keys and descriptions.
How many thumbs do I have, exactly?
Hopefully enough thumbs to really emphasize that these are all
guidelines. They’re tips that will help you unlock your imagination
and bring your world to vivid life. If you treat them like a
straitjacket, though, they’ll do the opposite. The important thing is to
do what’s right for the current scene and what’s most effective for
you and your players.

KEYING: DUNGEON FEATURES

Whether it’s an abandoned dwarven city, a border fortress, or a hive
of giant bees, a particular dungeon will typically have traits or
features shared by many or all of its rooms. For example, the
honeycomb material that makes up the walls of the beehive or the
blue glowgems, faint and oft-cracked with age, that illuminate the
halls of Khunbaral.
You could, of course, include these elements in every room key
where they’re relevant, no matter how many room keys that might
be, but this is a lot of duplicated effort and wasted space, and it can
actively debilitate the utility of a room key by cluttering it up with a
lot of extraneous noise. When looking at the description of a room,
you want the big, important stuff to pop out at you. You don’t want
it buried under mundane or routine details.
The Dungeon Features section of the key is designed to
conveniently summarize these common elements of the dungeon’s
rooms, while keeping those details separate from the individual
room keys. Common things to describe in your dungeon features
include:
Illumination

Ceiling Height
Walls
Doors

But you shouldn’t feel limited to these categories. If a dozen
different rooms in your dungeon have large, identical clockwork
spheres floating in the middle of them (for whatever reason), it may
be appropriate to describe them in detail in your dungeon features.
In larger dungeons, you might have several distinct sections (the
castle vs. the dungeon beneath it; the caves vs. the submerged
tunnels; the dwarven armories vs. the fungal farms). You might
want to include a separate set of Dungeon Features for each section,
or your single Dungeon Features section might just distinguish each
section appropriately. (You can see an example of this in the

Mephits & Magmin adventure on page 48, where the ceiling height
of the tunnels and finished areas are different from each other.)
However, don’t fall into the trap of trying to capture every nuance
of, for example, ceiling height in your dungeon features. The point
is to capture material that is broadly true in your dungeon so that
you don’t have to copy-and-paste that material into every key entry.
If a particular room or door is different from the dungeon’s norm,
there’s no need to make a big deal out of it: Just describe it
normally in the key.
This also means that it’s frequently not necessary to include every
category of information in your Dungeon Features section. If there is
no common type of door or ceiling height in the dungeon, for
example, that’s just fine.

KEYING: CORRIDOR THEMES

So you have a dungeon map depicting rooms that are linked to each
other either directly or via corridors. And you have a dungeon key
that describes the rooms.
But what about the corridors?
Corridors can, of course, be any number of things: hallways,
tunnels, courtyards, passages, shafts, stairs, etc. Because they
typically don’t appear on the dungeon key, however, they can often
default to blank ciphers or generic mush—just empty expanses of
gray stone or featureless utility spaces.
To avoid this, of course, you could just add every hallway to your
key. In practice, however, this becomes quite laborsome and tends
to bloat your dungeon key in ways that aren’t particularly useful.
Instead, you can add a Corridor Themes section to your dungeon
key. The goal here is to provide a palette you can draw from to
flexibly describe hallways on the fly as the PCs pass down them. For
example, in a haunted house your corridor theme might be
torn red carpets
a painting with eyes that follow you

broken furniture

cobwebs
broken glass on the floor
creaking floorboards

In a megacorp’s skyscraper, on the other hand, you might have
potted plants

security cameras
motivational propaganda posters

color-coded section stripes on the wall
navigational signs
touchscreen directories
maintenance drones
vending machines

Brief bullet points giving plug-and-play options you can drop in
might be all you need, or some of these elements might need
additional explanation (e.g., how the color-coding in the arcology
works). You could even key these elements to a random table if
you’d like to procedurally generate your descriptions of PCs
creeping between rooms. Whatever works for you and for the
dungeon.

HOMEBREW KEYS VS. PUBLISHED KEYS

This whole time I’ve been telling you to write down your key, but
what does that actually look like?
You might think that looks like the keys you see in published
adventures, but that’s not entirely accurate. A published key, like
the one you used while running Mephits & Magmin, may show you
the general form and the type of content you might prep for your
own dungeons, but it’s also far more verbose and polished.

This is because when I, for example, wrote Mephits & Magmin, I
needed the key to communicate my intentions to you. You obviously
don’t live inside my head, and so I had to clearly explain not only
what I was putting in the key, but also, to at least some extent, why
I was putting it into the key. There are also certain standards of
style and grammar that one simply expects in a professional
publication.
KEYING A HALLWAY
“But I have a reason to key this specific hallway!” Great. Do it.
Corridor themes are a way of focusing your prep, but if you
have some specific need that’s better served with a different
tool, you should follow that need.
One-off traps located in hallways are a good example of this.
Special doors that need to be resolved before entering the room
on the other side are another (whether they’re trapped, cursed,
or just have a magic mouth that asks you riddles).
When you’re keying a dungeon for yourself, on the other hand,
you don’t need to explain yourself clearly to someone else. You want
to put together complete, well-organized notes for your future self,
but you are, ultimately, talking to yourself.
For example, take a look at the key for Area 1 of Mephits &
Magmin on page 50. If I were keying that same room for use in my
personal game, it might look something like this:
AREA 1: CAVE ENTRANCE

rocky outcropping
cave entrance in the middle of a slag of broken rock
three mounds of mud visible

Wisdom (Perception)-DC 15: Spot mud mephit moving. DC 14
Arcana/Nature=mud mephits.
4 mud mephits, one hiding in tunnel. Ambush as PCs enter
cave.
Intelligence (Nature)-DC 12: Cave is a lava tube. Very old.
You can easily see the rough simplicity here. I already know what
the cave entrance looks like in my own head, so I only need a brief
list of the major points to refresh my memory, and from that I can
weave a full description at the table. Similarly, I know why I’ve
placed the fourth mephit inside the tunnel, so I only need a brief
reminder (“ambush as PCs enter cave”) to orient me.
The particular details of the version of the key you see here won’t
necessarily be ideal for you, either. For example, you might like to
pre-script more of the boxed text. On the other hand, maybe you
wouldn’t feel the need to write down the Wisdom (Perception)
check to spot the hidden mephits. (That is, after all, the standard
mechanic for doing so.)
The point is that you’re writing your key for an audience of one:
yourself. If you write it accordingly, without belaboring unnecessary
details or polishing your presentation, you’ll not only save prep time
but you’ll also likely end up with a better key that’s easier to use.

COMBAT ENCOUNTER DESIGN

Combat is an important part of many roleplaying games, and while
creating scenarios you’ll often find yourself supplying bad guys for
the PCs to punch, stab, eviscerate, or otherwise dispatch with
physical violence. The trick with designing these combat encounters
is that you want them to be difficult enough that the players feel a
risk of failure, but not so difficult that the PCs can’t possibly win.
For D&D, the Dungeon Master’s Guide includes detailed guidelines
for creating Easy, Medium, Hard, and Deadly encounters. You’ll
often find similar guidelines in other RPGs, too. These guidelines are
useful, but it’s also important to understand their limitations.

Encounter guidelines can only take into account the known abilities
of an NPC and compare them to the abilities of a typical group of
PCs. But the potential encounter space for an RPG is effectively
infinite and limited only by circumstance and imagination, and
there are a wide variety of variables that will affect the actual
difficulty of any specific encounter:
The players’ tactical decisions

The tactical decisions you make for the NPCs
The PCs’ abilities
The PCs’ equipment
The size of the battlefield
The terrain
The luck of the dice

And so forth. In my experience, the best an encounter design
system can do is ballpark a specific encounter’s difficulty and
outcome. Which, to be clear, is still incredibly useful.
Because of this, however, there’s a principle of encounter design
that I think you’ll find useful whether it’s your first RPG, the first
time you’re running a new RPG, or even just the first time you’re
running for a new group of players: When it comes to encounter
difficulty, you have to miss by a lot and for a fairly long time for
“too easy” to ruin your campaign. On the other hand, you only need
to miss once and by very little for “too hard” to kill all the PCs and
end your campaign immediately.
In other words, as you’re wrestling with encounter difficulty, aim
low. You can always dial it up over time to find the sweet spot for
your group.
The entertainment value of a combat encounter doesn’t entirely
derive from the risk of absolute failure in any case. For example,
PCs come equipped with lots of cool toys. It’s fun to use your
awesome powers and abilities to good effect, even if you’re just
tossing minions around on your way to the big boss.

Of course, if every fight is trivial the fun will wear out pretty
quickly. But you only need the challenge of a fight to be high
enough that there are consequences for making bad tactical
decisions. The possibility of a bad decision will incentivize players
to find the good decisions and to feel rewarded when they do.
There are entire books written on strategy and tactics, and an
encyclopedic discussion of the topic is probably somewhat beyond
the scope of introductory adventure design. But there are a few
tricks you can use to get the ball rolling.
First, look at the stat blocks in the encounter. What abilities does
the opponent have? Then think about how those abilities could be
enhanced through the use of terrain. This isn’t limited to fantastical
abilities, either. If an opponent has a potent ranged attack, for
example, could they be positioned in a way that would make it
difficult for the PCs to engage them in melee (e.g., on an upper level
or on the opposite side of a chasm)? What are the opponent’s
strengths? How can those be enhanced? What are its weaknesses?
How can those be protected?
You can either answer these questions based on the map you’ve
already designed, or you can flip it around and make sure to design
your rooms so that your bad guys can take tactical advantage of
them. (Don’t worry. The players will figure out how to turn the
tables and use the terrain to their own advantage soon enough.)
Second, build encounters that include multiple stat blocks. Not
just goblins, but:
goblins and ogres
goblins and blink dogs
goblins and tieflings
goblins and owlbears

Déjà vu, right? This ties conveniently into the principles we’ve
discussed for creating your scenario concept, but you can also use
one-off companions, pets, and the like to spike individual
encounters. You can also include multiple stat blocks using variants

of the same creature type. These might be extraordinary individuals
(e.g., a goblin magi or chief), but can also be larger divisions within
a society or species (e.g., goblin shadowstalkers vs. blood warriors).
Having two different stat blocks in the same encounter
automatically gives the players a meaningful choice in target
selection regardless of the specific tactical situation: If you’re
fighting six blood warriors, it doesn’t matter which one you hit first.
If you’re fighting three blood warriors and three shadowstalkers, on
the other hand, you’ll have to figure out which one needs to be
prioritized.
Multiple stat blocks also give you, as the DM, the ability to
combine the abilities of those opponents in interesting ways. Six
blood warriors can do what blood warriors can do. But if they form
a defensive line blocking the corridor and the goblin magi lays
down a grease spell that forces the PC melee fighters to make
Dexterity saving throws while fighting on the front line, then
fighting the blood warriors has instantly become a novel tactical
dilemma for the players to solve.
I’ve generally found that you get most of the potential benefits
here when you add the second stat block. Although much larger
encounters could certainly benefit from three or four or even more
stat block varieties, this quickly becomes complexity for the sake of
complexity, resulting in diminishing or even negative returns.
Novelty in general can often be overrated here. Yes, it can be
exciting to get a constant stream of new stuff, but it also comes at a
cost and can even backfire.
The reason for this is mastery: As you spend more time playing
goblin shadowstalkers, for example, you will quickly become
familiar with their mechanics. You’ll memorize their AC and attack
bonuses so that you don’t have to keep looking them up all the time.
This will speed up the pace of combat and free you to focus on
improving other aspects of play. You’ll also be learning how to use
the shadowstalkers’ abilities to their best effect, improving your
tactical mastery, and finding new ways to challenge the PCs.

Even more importantly, the players will also be mastering the
shadowstalkers. They’ll be learning what they can do and figuring
out the best way to, for example, guard against their shadow step.
They’ll start casting protection from poison spells to give them an
advantage against their asp-tipped blades.
If every single goblin in your dungeon is a special snowflake with
a package of unique abilities that aren’t shared by any other goblin,
neither you nor your players would get the pleasure of learning
what a goblin can do and then applying that knowledge.
Chess doesn’t become a more interesting game if you only play it
once and then toss it aside for another game; it becomes less
interesting because you never learn its tactical and strategic depths.
A constant, never-ending stream of novelty doesn’t make for a richer
experience. It flattens the experience.
Of course, if the only thing the PCs ever fought were goblin
shadowstalkers, the shadowstalkers would soon wear out their
welcome.
Fortunately, you can have the best of both worlds. As we’ve
already seen, you can get a lot of variety—while also leveraging
mastery—by combining a small variety of stat blocks into a bunch
of different combinations over the course of a dungeon: A goblin
magi with shadowstalkers will have a different tactical impact than
a goblin magi with a squad of blood warriors, or blood warriors and
shadowstalkers together, or any of the three in a squad by
themselves.
And then, when the PCs move on to a new scenario or the next
level of a larger dungeon, you can mix things up with a fresh
selection of foes.
WHAT ABOUT A RANDOM ENCOUNTER TABLE?
If you’re eager to add random encounter checks to your dungeon
procedure, you’ll need to build a random encounter table for your
adventure. You can skip ahead to Random Encounter Tables in

Advanced Dungeons on page 160 for a step-by-step guide to
designing one.

5 + 5 DUNGEONS

At this point you’re hopefully bubbling over with ideas for what
your first dungeon will be, but it might still feel a little
overwhelming as you try to figure out how to take all of this stuff—
scenario concepts, keys, maps, encounters, dungeon features, oh my!
—and develop it into a playable adventure.
To get started, therefore, I recommend creating a 5 + 5 Dungeon.
The 5 + 5 Dungeon is an adventure recipe. These recipes work a
lot like any other recipe: They detail a proven template for a
successful adventure and a list of required ingredients. Simply
provide the adventure ingredients, follow the recipe to add them
to your adventure, and you’ll be good to go!
STEP 1: THE SCENARIO CONCEPT
As with any dungeon, you’ll want to start your 5 + 5 Dungeon with
a strong scenario concept: location, denizens, and goal. What type of
dungeon is it? Who will the PCs be confronting there? What are the
PCs trying to do?
We discussed how to find inspiration for your scenario concept on
page 94.
STEP 2: DUNGEON FEATURES & CORRIDOR THEMES
Take a blank page—whether that’s paper, in your word processor, a
link in your campaign wiki, or whatever else works for you—and
write “DUNGEON FEATURES” at the top of it. Then grab another
one and label it “CORRIDOR THEMES.”
If there are details that you immediately think should be added to
these lists, you should go for it. But your primary goal right now is
to give yourself a space to jot down notes and features that occur to
you while keying.

Additional details on dungeon features can be found on page 111,
and corridor themes are on page 112.
STEP 3: FIVE FEATURED ROOMS
Your 5 + 5 Dungeon will include five featured rooms. Create:
1 challenge (see here)
1 fight (see here)
1 twist (see here)

1 reward (see here)
Pick a second challenge, fight, twist, or reward.
So, for example, you might have a dungeon with two fights, a
challenge, a twist, and a reward. Or two rewards, a fight, a twist,
and a challenge.
These room archetypes are described on pages 125 to 136.
THE FIFTH ROOM
Having a fifth room that doubles one of the others is a way to
mix things up so that your 5 + 5 Dungeons all feel a little
unique from each other in pacing and structure. You don’t want
your adventures to feel rote or predictable, even if the players
only notice it subconsciously.
The fifth room also gives you an opportunity to tailor content
to a PC who might not have a lot to do in the rest of the
dungeon. Or, alternatively, to give the whole group an extra
helping of the game play you know they like the most.

5 + 5 BRAINSTORMING
As you’re brainstorming for your 5 + 5 Dungeon, you’ll likely end
up doing steps 2 and 3 at the same time. Heck, you’ll probably end
up doing a good chunk of your brainstorming during step 1. That’s

okay. The adventure police are not going to kick down your door for
skipping around in whatever way makes sense to you: The 5 + 5
Dungeon recipe is flexible. And I’m pretty sure the adventure police
don’t even exist.
STEP 4: SCENIC ROOMS
Next, add five scenic rooms to your dungeon. Scenic room
archetypes are described on page 123.
Having a total of ten rooms in your 5 + 5 Dungeon (five scenic
rooms plus five featured rooms) is designed to pace the dungeon
and provide enough material for a typical four-hour session of play.
STEP 5: MAPPING & KEYING
Review the tips and tricks for mapping on page 100, creating a
connection map to work out the relationships between your scenic
and featured rooms before executing your final map on graph paper.
Give the players interesting navigational choices to make by
including
forks in corridors,
rooms with more than one exit,
secret doors and passages, and
crossroads.

The even balance between scenic and featured rooms is designed
to give the players room to explore, so don’t clump all the scenic
rooms together in one half of the dungeon and all the featured
rooms together in the other half. But you also don’t want to just
alternate between scenic and featured rooms, because that will
become very predictable for the players.
STEP 6: FINISHING TOUCHES
With your map and key done, revisit your corridor theme and
dungeon features. Clean up your notes and add any additional
details to finish fleshing them out.

The last thing to consider is the scenario hook: Why do the PCs
want to explore this dungeon and how do they learn of its
existence?
A few widely applicable scenario hooks are as follows:
Someone hired them to go to the dungeon and do something.
The PCs found a treasure map or heard locals talking about
something valuable in the dungeon.

The PCs were attacked and tracked their attackers back to the
dungeon.
For your first few adventures, as with Mephits & Magmin, you
may want to start the adventure in medias res: At the beginning of
the session, the PCs are standing at the dungeon entrance and you
briefly explain how they got there and what their goal is. But, when
you’re ready, it can also be a good idea (and quite fun!) to actually
play through these events.
If you’d like to get more ambitious with your scenario hooks,
check out Extra Credit: Scenario Hooks on page 498.

DUNGEON ROOMS: SCENIC

Scenic rooms, as we’ve discussed, are designed to be passed through
with minimal interaction. If the PCs stop to examine anything at all,
it should be quickly resolved and they will be on their way again.
While a scenic room can be pedestrian, mundane, or even
completely empty, don’t hesitate for a moment to fill it with eye
candy. Keying a scenic room can often be about identifying the “one
cool thing” it contains, with such features serving as landmarks,
inspiring awe, or even invoking terror. (Or all of the above.)
THEMED

Dungeons have themes—of place, character, concept, ideology,
mood, or composition. The themed room establishes, develops, or
manipulates those themes.
At the most basic level, simply look to your scenario concept:
How can the themed room reflect the location, denizens, or goal? If
the PCs are exploring a gothic mansion, this could be a dining room
with strange décor or a bedroom draped in black veils. If the bandits
keep a pack of trained wolves, this could be their empty kennels. If
the party is here to steal Lord Denton’s gold, then it might be the
sitting room where he has proudly displayed his old prospecting
map.
In this way the themed room can also act as foreshadowing or
provide clues for what the rest of the dungeon might contain.
UTILITY
If you think of the dungeon as a real place, then there are often
rooms that should logically just exist. The bandit fort should have
barracks; the abandoned dwarven city’s forges should be long cold;
the haunted zeppelin should have ghosts on the flight deck.
Such rooms can also serve as the set pieces for challenges, fights,
or the like. But, if not, they can (and often should!) be included as
scenic rooms.
FANTASTIC FEATURE
Magic makes all things possible. Take the opportunity to imagine
the impossible and feature it in a scenic room, evoking a sense of
wonder in the players as they explore your setting.
Fantastic features can include stuff like:
a levitation sculpture formed from floating amethysts

magical paintings that come to life
an oracular spirit frozen in a block of rune-carved amber
a tree with metallic leaves
a room where all the furniture is limned in faerie fire

a taxidermied unicorn
a waterfall of black acid

a room of magical portals leading to other rooms in the dungeon
an observatory that shows the sky of some other alien world
a shrine dedicated to unknown gods

This isn’t limited to fantasy games, of course. Science fiction,
horror, and other speculative genres all offer a palette for creating
the exotic and awe-inspiring. In fact, you could interpret this more
broadly as an opportunity to highlight your chosen genre.

DUNGEON ROOMS: CHALLENGE

A dungeon should be about more than just fights. (We’ll get to those
in a moment.) There are many other challenges that can be
featured, and including stuff that can’t be automatically responded
to with eldritch blasts and pointy steel will encourage the players to
creatively engage with the adventure and actively think about what
their course of action should be. In fact, challenges can be most
effective when they’re presented in the form of a dilemma—a tough
choice between two options.
TRAP
A trap is often seen as the default non-combat challenge in a
dungeon. Like combat, a trap threatens the PCs with damage or a
debilitating effect, often blocking their journey until they have
figured out how to bypass or overcome it.
We discussed how to design and run traps extensively in the last
chapter. See Running Traps on page 87.
ENVIRONMENTAL
Hazardous environments—volcanic eruptions, toxic gas, pools of
acid, rotten floorboards, rock slides, etc.—usually work like traps,
but there are other forms of environmental challenge, too.
Examples of environmental challenges could include:

a broken bridge over a vast chasm

debilitating heat that exhausts over time unless preventative
measures are taken
force fields blocking a hallway
a tall cliff that must be climbed
a polluted river that needs to be cleaned

needing shelter during a sudden blizzard
swimming across a rapids-filled river

navigating through an area of magical darkness
a drawbridge that needs to be lowered to access the castle
Environmental challenges evoke the dungeon location, making it
an active part of play instead of just scenery that the group glides
past.
SKILL
You will, of course, use skill checks throughout the entire game,
including when you’re resolving other types of challenge rooms.
Sometimes, however, it can be useful to think of challenges from a
skill-first perspective, if for no other reason than that it allows you
to use the list of skills in your game of choice as a source of
inspiration.
A good skill-based challenge, however, isn’t just about targeting
the character’s skill. It’s also about the player’s skill. Much like a
trap, if a challenge simply boils down to the DM telling the player
to, “Make such and such a skill check,” the player rolling the dice,
and the outcome being declared, that’s hardly exciting or engaging
game play.
Ideally, you want to present a situation in the game world that
challenges the player to figure out the solution before executing it
(with a successful skill check or otherwise). It’s even better if the
player is able to create their own solution to the problem. Complex
challenges that require several steps or simultaneous problems to be
overcome are also a great way to increase interest.

PUZZLE
Riddles, ciphers, logic puzzles, and similar challenges are another
great way of engaging player skill, but they can be tricky to pull off
successfully.
First, puzzles often require someone to have just the right bit of
insight to solve them. This can make them quite fragile in practice,
and if none of the players can figure out the solution to your puzzle,
the entire session can grind to a painful and frustrating halt.
To avoid this, puzzles should almost always be optional. Instead
of blocking access to the next section of the adventure, for example,
the puzzle can instead grant access to an optional reward. For
puzzles that do give access to the next section of the adventure,
make sure to include alternatives. If you have a door that can be
opened by answering a riddle, for example, then you might include
an alternative route that will force the PCs to face something
dangerous. Or simply make sure that the PCs can also hack the door
open with their axe or cast a knock spell to get through.
Players may also want to use a skill check to simply have their
characters solve the puzzle for them. From a certain point of view,
this makes sense (“My wizard is much smarter than me!”), but it
tends to defeat the reason for including the puzzle in the first place.
Instead of providing the solution on a successful check, consider
giving the player a hint to help them solve the puzzle. Clues to a
puzzle’s solution can also be hidden in other rooms of the dungeon,
allowing clever players to solve the puzzle directly, while others
piece it together through exploration.
In order for many types of puzzles to be solvable by the players,
though, they may need to be able to actually see what their
characters see. Puzzles, therefore, often benefit from prepping
physical handouts.
There are many different forms that a puzzle can take:
a riddle posed by a sphinx
an encoded letter that must be deciphered

a shattered clay tablet that must be pieced back together

a set of colored statues that must be arranged on plinths
according to the color wheel
a maze the PCs must successfully navigate

a lock with a combination the PCs must figure out
a secret message that’s been encoded on the gravestones in a
cemetery
flashes of light containing a hidden message in Morse code

four shrines each containing a statue dedicated to one of the four
elements; the PCs must expose each statue to the appropriate
element

a room in which only specific tiles on the mosaic floor are safe to
stand on
SOCIAL
In a social challenge, the PCs have to accomplish their goals by
interacting with the NPCs in the dungeon. That might be the bad
guys of the scenario, but there will often be other characters in the
dungeon, creating a wide variety of possible social interactions.
In practice, a social challenge may devolve into combat.
Conversely, there are many would-be combat encounters that can be
bypassed with clever diplomacy. This is a good reminder that these
room archetypes are not hard-and-fast categories. There’s a lot of
overlap in what you design, and the really great rooms will, in any
case, invite the players to think outside the box and create their own
solutions, taking the dungeon in directions you never could have
anticipated.
Examples of social challenges include:
The palace majordomo expects a bribe.
The undead courtesan doesn’t realize that she’s long dead.

Another faction in the dungeon must be convinced to help the PCs
defeat a common foe.

The bandit king will help the PCs, but only if they do something
morally questionable.
The PCs are interrogating a prisoner.
A rival band of adventurers could share what they’ve learned
about the dungeon, if the PCs can make it worth their while.

Two NPCs have a feud and they want the PCs to adjudicate it.
The PCs convince the “bad guys” that they’ve been tricked into
attacking innocents.
The bandits mistake the PCs as being emissaries sent by the local
necromancer—can they keep up the bluff and avoid detection?
A devil attempts to trick the PCs into signing a contract for their
souls.
ROLEPLAYING IS EVERYTHING
Some DMs will refer to social challenges as “roleplaying
challenges.” Personally, I try to avoid this because it creates the
impression that “roleplaying” is only the bit of the game where
your character is talking.
Roleplaying, though, is much more than that. It’s about playing
a role. It’s about making choices as if you were your character.
Combat, for example, isn’t the place where you should be
hitting the pause button on roleplaying. Exactly the opposite, in
fact. Combat is where your character is making life or death
decisions. It’s the ultimate crucible where character is tested
and defined. Think about movies like Saving Private Ryan, Bullet
in the Head, Black Hawk Down, or Avengers: Infinity War.
This extends to the entire dungeon. There aren’t “roleplaying
rooms” and “not roleplaying rooms.” Every single room is a
chance for players to express themselves and develop their
characters.

DUNGEON ROOMS: FIGHT

Rooms with a fight archetype are designed to be resolved with the
combat mechanics. The vast panoply of possible opponents, which
can be mixed together in any number of combinations, creates an
almost infinite variety of encounters, while the formal combat
mechanics found in most roleplaying games create a comfortable
familiarity and security in running them at the table.
Check out Combat Encounter Design, page 115, for an in-depth
look at designing these encounters.
GUARDIAN
A guardian encounter seeks to protect something—a room, a
treasure, a character, the entire dungeon, or maybe just
itself/themselves. You can probably think of this as a “typical”
combat encounter. There’ll be a bunch of opponents in a room and
they’ll stand and fight until the fight is done.
SENTRY
A sentry encounter, on the other hand, is designed to raise the
alarm. Rather than standing and fighting, a sentry will attempt to
run and fetch help, ring a bell, activate an alarm spell, or the like. A
common variant is for some opponents in the encounter to stand
and fight while others run to raise the alarm.
A sentry room will generally be designed as an easier encounter,
giving the PCs a chance to stop the alarm from being raised if they
can act quickly, stealthily, and/or decisively.
When designing a sentry encounter, of course, you’ll want to give
some thought to what the consequences will be if the alarm is
raised.
MOOKS
Mooks are henchmen, foot soldiers, minions, petty street gangs, and
similar fireball fodder. They’re the guys Jackie Chan or John Wick
throw around to fill the scene with furious action and look like badasses. Such encounters shouldn’t be completely trivial in an RPG,

but these are the easy fights that the PCs will usually steamroll
(unless they suffer a spate of ill fortune or have already been badly
injured). That’s okay! Easier fights not only provide a change of
pace, the contrast between Mook encounters and Guardian or Boss
encounters will also make the tough fights feel tougher.
In more advanced dungeons (see here), Mook encounters also
make great reinforcements that can be summoned by Sentry
encounters and similar alarums.
MOOKS ARE EVERYWHERE
Mook-type opponents, of course, can be used in any combat
encounter, not just Mook encounters. In Guardian and Boss rooms,
they provide ablative shielding and crank up the action. They can
also make good Sentries, with the PCs needing to mow them down
before they can scatter and alert the big bads.
BOSS
Bosses are the big, significant bad guys. There are lots of different
concepts for bosses—end bosses, mini-bosses, optional super-bosses,
puzzle bosses, recurring bosses, dual bosses, summoned bosses,
staged bosses—but the key thing is that these are the tough fights.
They feature an opponent with a stat block that’s a whole lot nastier
than everybody else in the dungeon, and the PCs are going to have
their limits tested in the fight. (Unless, of course, they get clever
about things.)
Boss encounters should usually feature other opponents in
addition to the boss. In most roleplaying games, having four, five, or
six PCs all gang up on a solo opponent usually doesn’t make for a
great encounter. There are exceptions, but even if the action
economy of having a bunch of PCs all focus fire on a single
opponent doesn’t turn the boss into a mook, the tactics of such an
encounter are rarely interesting. (PCs with melee attacks will just
swarm the boss and then the rest of the fight turns into a dicerolling slog.)

Since the boss is the most dangerous combat encounter in the
area, it’s not unusual to assume that they’re the one in charge. But
that’s not necessarily true—they might be the real leader’s
champion, enslaved demon, loyal sister, summoned creature, or any
number of other possibilities.
It’s also easy to make the opposite assumption: If someone’s in
charge, then they must be a boss (i.e., bigger and stronger than
everybody else). That’s also not necessarily true, either. In Mephits
& Magmin, for example, Asuvius has essentially the same stat block
as the other magmin.
Bosses are cool, but they’re not a necessity. Don’t feel as if you’re
obligated to include them in your adventure. It’ll make them feel
even more special when you do want to use one.

DUNGEON ROOMS: TWIST

A complication, a surprise, an inversion of expectation. As the
players fall into a rhythm and start to feel as if they’ve got
everything figured out, a good Twist room will throw them for a
loop and force them to actively reengage with the dungeon until
they can get back on top of things again.
TRICK
A good trick room appears to be one thing, but is actually another:
A shrouded maiden chained to the wall is actually a medusa,
waiting to strike.
An illusory feast is disguising food that is actually rotten and
disgusting.

A fake treasure is used to lure the PCs into a trap.
A lowly servant seems ready to turn on his cruel masters but is
actually the bandit king in disguise.
A rotating room designed to disorient the PC and thwart their
mapping.
Escher-like chambers with non-Euclidean geometry.

A false door leaves the PCs trapped.

Teleportation areas seamlessly move the PCs to a different
location in the dungeon.
A treasure map shows a false version of the dungeon’s layout.
A “ghost” that is actually just an elaborate hoax.

In some cases it’s the whole dungeon that’s a trick, and this room
is actually the revelation of what’s really going on. This is the
moment when the PCs realize that the goblins are actually the good
guys and the villainous villagers tricked them, or that the legendary
treasure they seek has been cursed and the entire dungeon is a
prison seeking to keep its great evil contained.
SECRET AREA
Secret rooms make for great bonus areas, while secret corridors can
provide shortcuts through the dungeon or allow PCs to outflank
their enemy’s defenses.
REMIX
Take one of the other rooms in the dungeon and find a way to twist
it or invert it, so that the players will be able to leverage their
experience with the other chamber while simultaneously needing to
puzzle out the differences. (Or vice versa, since they may often be
able to encounter the rooms in either order.)
If the other room was scenic, then perhaps this room only
superficially appears the same while actually concealing some
hidden danger (e.g., the suits of armor in this hallway are animated
and will attack intruders). If it’s a challenge, then the solution that
worked in the other room won’t work in this one (e.g., a waterfall
cascades down the rocks here, making them slippery and more
difficult to climb; or there’s a riddle that seems identical if you don’t
listen carefully, but it requires a different answer). If it’s a fight,
then the terrain is radically different or perhaps the enemies have a
unique set of abilities, spells, or magical items (e.g., surprise
flamethrower!). And so forth.

COMBO
Take two different room archetypes and combine them together in
one room. (This can include other Trick room archetypes.)
When looking for a combo, try to find a room that’s greater than
the sum of its parts. Fortunately, you may be surprised at how often
this just sort of automatically happens as a result of putting two
different things in the same place: Ogres in a trapped room can use
that trap to their advantage, while ogres assaulting the room where
the PCs are trying to get across a chasm immediately add the
pressure of time to the skill challenge.
Another thing to keep in mind when building a combo is that the
two elements can be tightly interwoven. Rather than just having a
boss and a puzzle in the same room, for example, you could have a
boss who is a puzzle—e.g., they can only be harmed if exposed to
sunlight.
UNEXPECTED ENDING
A very specific type of twist is the unexpected ending, when the PCs
think they’ve wrapped everything up but things suddenly slip away
from them.
This might be the revelation that the ogres were working for
Prince Rupert the whole time, revealing the true boss that they still
need to defeat! Or maybe they discover that the princess they
sought to rescue is actually being held in a different château,
creating a link to their next adventure.

DUNGEON ROOMS: REWARDS

Rewards! Why are we even in this dungeon stabbing and shooting
and blasting things? The loot!
Some rewards will be purely mechanical in nature (e.g.,
experience points), but most will be grounded in the narrative of the
game world. Some of these will be mechanically tokenized to one
degree or another (gold pieces, blessings, charms, and epic boons in
D&D, for example), whereas others will flow entirely from and be

significant only because of the fictional reality of our characters,
including their goals, aspirations, and fears.
TREASURE
Wealth! Some treasure is useful in its own right, while other
treasure will give the PCs funds to pursue their dreams and achieve
their agendas:
Glittering piles of gold and silver coins
Marvelous magic items
Sparkling gems and precious jewels
Beautiful works of art
Historical artifacts
Antique furniture
Lost technology

Rare books and manuscripts
Armories filled with weapons
Valuable trade goods

While coinage is simple, making treasure more specific can make
it memorable and feel more special while also inviting the players to
come up with clever ways of using or leveraging the treasure. The
process of liquidating treasure can also be used as the hook for
future scenarios, while putting treasure in a bulky form can make
the process of actually removing it from the dungeon a unique
challenge in its own right.
CLUE
The room’s reward might be a vital piece of information. This clue
might reveal something about another room in the dungeon (e.g.,
there’s a secret passage in the library or the shadowstalkers are
vulnerable to sunlight). Alternatively, it might be the scenario hook
for a whole new adventure (e.g., a treasure map revealing the
location of another dungeon).

SANCTUARY
This place provides a place of safety within the dungeon where the
PCs can safely rest or find some other form of respite. Examples
include:
a secret chamber the denizens of the dungeon are ignorant of

a room that can be made secure if magical wards are activated
a sanctified chapel shunned by the undead
a mystic font that provides magical healing
the clan caves of friendly goblins who welcome the PCs

False sanctuaries can offer an interesting twist, but they generally
work best if it’s possible for the PCs to realize the truth before being
caught off guard.
BOON
These rooms contain some resource or benefit that will aid the PCs.
These advantages can be generic in nature (PCs can always use
another potion of healing), but are often more compelling if they’re
more specifically tied to the present scenario. For example:
potions of fire resistance in a dungeon filled with magma mephits
a blessing, charm, or other supernatural gift

a potential ally who might be willing to fight alongside the PCs
a silver salve for the eyes that can reveal which goblins have been
corrupted by the shadow maggots
uniforms that the PCs can use to disguise themselves as guards

The effectiveness of many boons may be limited to the current
scenario, but others may persist long after the scenario has come to
an end.
SCENARIO GOAL
This room contains whatever it is that the PCs are trying to achieve
or retrieve in the dungeon.

It’s not unusual for this to be a room with a combo twist,
combining the scenario reward with a guardian or challenge that
must be overcome to claim it. (But it’s also possible those
protections are in the next room over and this room simply serves as
the denouement of the adventure.) Scenario twists may also mean
that the scenario goal isn’t what the PCs thought it would be when
they first entered the dungeon.
In other cases, the scenario goal might be one and the same as
overcoming some other room type. (For example, defeating Prince
Rupert in combat or cleansing the goblins’ water supply as a skill
challenge.) You can consider that sort of goal to be a combo twist if
that’s useful to you, but I wouldn’t worry too much about trying to
achieve some sort of perfect classification.
Along these same lines, it’s not unusual for a scenario goal to be
one of the other reward types: claiming the Sword of Fatherfall
(treasure), finding the map revealing the location of the Lost City of
Shandrala (clue), bringing the refugees to a place of safety
(sanctuary), or waking the Sleeping Knights to join their crusade
(boon).

RUN YOUR SCENARIO

Now that you’ve created your first scenario, it’s time to bring it to
the table and share it with your players!
For the most part, you’re going to find that this works almost
exactly like the first dungeon scenario that you ran. (Except you
created it!) To incorporate the new techniques from the How to Run
a Dungeon chapter, start by making a copy of the Dungeon Running
Sheet. Then, a few hours before the game is scheduled to start, take
a few minutes to review the dungeon turn, dungeon actions, and
random encounter checks.
If you’re feeling overwhelmed, remember that you don’t need to
add all these procedures in at once. For example, you could use
dungeon turns but wait before introducing random encounters.

If you have several hours to play, the players will likely finish
your entire dungeon. But if not, that’s okay! When it’s getting close
to the time you need to quit playing, find a good stopping point
(ideally one where everyone is eager to see what happens next!) and
then schedule another session when everyone can come back and
finish the adventure!

… AND FOR YOUR NEXT ADVENTURE

Now that you’ve created and run your first dungeon, you may be
wondering, “What comes next?” The most immediate answer to that
question is likely, “Do it again.”
Dungeon crawl scenarios are also known as location crawls, and
as we’ve seen, these locations can be almost anything. The 5 + 5
Dungeon recipe is also very versatile, allowing you to pour almost
any idea you might have into a tried-and-true formula. So there’s no
reason you shouldn’t keep running these adventures while you and
your players grow more comfortable with the game. It really is
possible to run an entire campaign armed with nothing more than
these simple dungeons.
Once you’ve become comfortable and confident, though—or
maybe even a session or two before that happens—you’ll eventually
want to start expanding your adventures beyond the confines of the
5 + 5 Dungeon. To do that, we’ll begin by taking our dungeons to
the next level. (If you’ll pardon the pun.) The Advanced Dungeons
(see here) and Dynamic Dungeons (see here) chapters will give you
a lot of new tools and options for this, but don’t feel like you need
to use them all at once! With each new adventure you create and
run, pick and choose what you want to explore next.

ADVANCED DUNGEONS

Dungeons come in a variety of sizes. The 5 + 5 Dungeon recipe in
the last chapter creates a fairly typical example, with enough
content to fill roughly four hours of play—one or two sessions for a
typical group.
Micro-dungeons are smaller, with only one or two featured
rooms and a similar number of scenic rooms. Probably no more than
five rooms at most. These dungeons lack the dynamic elements and
opportunities for exploration found in larger dungeons. (In most
micro-dungeons, you probably don’t even need to bother using
dungeon turns.) But the great thing about a micro-dungeon is that it
can be incorporated into a larger adventure without taking up a full
session.
A large dungeon, on the other hand, is at least three times the
size of a typical 5 + 5 Dungeon. Large dungeons will have at least
thirty rooms or so, and often even more than that. A lot of published
dungeon adventures feature large dungeons, with the expectation
that exploring the dungeon will take up several sessions of play.
The key difference of the large dungeon, however, is not simply
its size or playing time. It’s the expectation that clearing the
dungeon will require multiple expeditions. In other words, the PCs
will enter the dungeon, explore a portion of it, but then be forced to
retreat (or otherwise find respite) for a long rest and resupply,
returning to the dungeon later to renew the exploration in a new
expedition.
This core concept of visiting and revisiting the dungeon—as
opposed to simply bulling your way forward until you reach the
“end”—fundamentally changes the pace of play. Which is good,
because the simplistic “kick down the door” style of play, where the
PCs systematically go from one door to the next clearing each room
they find, can become terribly monotonous in larger dungeons.
To run a successful large dungeon—and, indeed, what makes a
large dungeon a special experience—the players have to be able to
make strategic choices using the knowledge they’ve gleaned from
previous expeditions to improve their chances of success on their
current expedition. This means some combination of the following:

Having goals other than “kill all the monsters.” Because RPGs
often have detailed combat systems, it can be easy to default to
“clear the dungeon” as a default goal, particularly for a dungeon
adventure. But if the goal is just “kill all the monsters,” then most
of the strategy goes out the window and the PCs are reduced to
mindless drones kicking down every door. We’re ahead of the
game here, because we already discussed setting dungeon goals
in our scenario concept (see here).
Having non-linear, xandered dungeon design (see here). If
there’s only one route through the dungeon, then it’s impossible
for the PCs to learn the dungeon geography and make strategic
choices. This also defaults the dungeon back to “kill all the
monsters” (because there’s no way for the PCs to strategically
avoid any of them).
Having varied experiences in the dungeon, not only because
variety is the spice of life but also because it will provide
strategic choice. (“I’d rather try to ride the rapids of the Dark
River than fight the orcs” is a richer choice than “I’d rather fight
the goblins than fight the orcs,” although there’s nothing
inherently wrong with the latter by any means.) Using a mixture
of different featured rooms (see here) and reaction checks (see
here) will go a long way here.
Having the dungeon come to life as an active environment.
This makes each expedition into the dungeon a fresh and slightly
different experience, as the PCs make strategic choices in an
evolving fog of war and can directly apply the lessons learned—
particularly geographic lessons—from previous expeditions in
new contexts and in response to new challenges. To achieve this
effect, we’ll start by using random encounters (see here),
restocking procedures (see here), and updating the dungeon key
(see here). Then, when you’re ready to take these techniques to
the next level, you can check out Dynamic Dungeons (see here).

Some of these are, as you can see, things you’re already doing.
The rest of this chapter, and the next, is going to give you the tools

to do everything else.
EXPEDITION-BASED PLAY
The basic dynamic of expedition-based play is that the party
gathers a set of resources and then goes forth to pursue a goal.
(In other words, they plan the expedition and then go on the
expedition.) This goal might be something generic (e.g., “Get as
much gold as possible”) or it might be something terribly
specific (e.g., “Get revenge by slaying Orok the Minotaur”).
Some of the resources gathered for the expedition will be
mechanical in nature (e.g., hit points, spell slots, etc.), but it’s
likely that the PCs will also gather other resources (e.g., magic
potions, rations, ammunition, etc.). Either way, the PCs will
expend these resources over the course of the expedition until
they run out of resources, at which point they will have to
withdraw to some form of base camp at which they can
replenish their resources in preparation for their next
expedition.
What makes expedition-based play interesting is that the
players are trying to maximize the return on their investment.
In other words, they want to achieve as much as possible—to
get the most gold, to clear out the maximum number of Orok’s
minions, to achieve as many milestones as possible on the way
to their goal—with the resources that they have. This creates a
crucible in which their strategic and tactical decisions become
extremely meaningful and, therefore, extremely interesting.
To make expedition-based play really work, you want a cost
associated with abandoning the current expedition and starting
a new one. This is often the money spent on new supplies, but
it can also be in the difficulty level of getting back to the point
where they left off (which can be achieved in dungeon

scenarios with random encounters and restocking, as discussed
later in this chapter).
Beyond the large dungeon, there is another category: the
megadungeon.
There are three defining characteristics of the megadungeon, each of
which is only tangentially related to its size:
It must have enough content to support a full campaign. (For
D&D, we might say that it has to be able to support two full tiers
of play, with each tier being roughly five levels.)
It must be large enough that “clear the dungeon” cannot be an
achievable goal. In other words, you can play the entire
campaign in the megadungeon and, when you are done, the
megadungeon will still be there, waiting for you (or someone
else) to continue exploring its depths.

It must, in some way, contain multiple “scenarios.” This usually
takes the form of either having multiple distinct goals that can be
independently, or semi-independently, pursued in the
megadungeon and/or having disparate factions, each of which
controls a chunk of the dungeon and poses a unique collection of
challenges. (In some ways, you can even think of the
megadungeon as being made up of a number of individual
dungeon experiences that are simply connected or intermeshed
with each other.)
The earliest D&D campaigns, including those that existed even
before D&D did—like Dave Arneson’s Castle Blackmoor and, later,
Gary Gygax’s Castle Greyhawk—were originally megadungeon
campaigns. They provide a surprisingly robust and diverse play
experience, emphasizing a goal-oriented style of play, and, like
dungeons in general, are not limited to underground warrens: They
could be a derelict, alien colony ship in a science fiction game or a
vast garden maze in Wonderland.

The tools you’ll use to run a megadungeon will mostly be the
same as the ones you’ll use for large dungeons, although the scope
and scale of the megadungeon may, as we’ll see, alter your best
practices a bit.
LEAVING THE MEGADUNGEON
Although a megadungeon can support an entire campaign, that
doesn’t mean it needs to be the entire campaign. It can be quite
useful to break up the megadungeon experience with other
scenarios. There are a number of ways you can set this up, but a
fairly straightforward method is to just include clues in the dungeon
that point to adventures outside of the dungeon. Treasure maps are
a great way to do this!

CUSTOMIZING THE DUNGEON TURN

As you become more comfortable running your dungeons and begin
exploring a wider array of dungeon types, one of the first things you
may want to start experimenting with is the dungeon procedure
itself.
As an extreme example, you might have a dungeon that’s
completely abandoned, perhaps protected only with ancient booby
traps or with guardians that are all automatons limited to individual
rooms. For such an adventure, you might not want to use dungeon
turns at all. Dungeon turns, after all, are designed to track time and
trigger effects, like random encounters, accordingly. If a dungeon
doesn’t have any time-based effects or pressure, there may be no
advantage to mucking about with the extra bookkeeping of the
dungeon turn.
The point is that there’s nothing sacrosanct about the default
dungeon turn procedure. It’s not the One True Way™ of running a
dungeon. It can—and should!—be modified.
Encounter frequency is a good example of this. The default
encounter check is 1 in 1d8, but maybe you’re running an adventure

in an abandoned city in the middle of the desert and you really
want to emphasize how barren and desolate the location is. In that
case you might decide to only check for an encounter every other
turn, or make a 1 in 1d12 or 1 in 1d20 check instead.
Conversely, if you were running an adventure in a highly secured
goblin fortress with regular guard patrols, you might want to crank
up the rate of random encounters. Or make a second encounter
check each turn specifically for the guard patrols.
Similarly, you can vary the encounter frequency and/or the
encounter tables used depending on where the PCs are located in
the dungeon. (This can, for example, create high-risk areas. It could
also create less populated regions where the PCs might be able to
risk taking a rest.)
You can also bias reaction checks. For example, rolling 2d6 + 2
for a reaction check would eliminate the possibility of dungeon
denizens immediately attacking the PCs on sight. Conversely, a 2d62 check would increase the average hostility of the dungeon. You
could also create custom tables and checks to achieve whatever
spread of probability feels appropriate.
In addition to encounter checks and reaction checks, you might
introduce custom checks for the dungeon. For example, in the
faerie warrens of the Snow Queen you might have a 1 in 6 check
each turn to see if blizzard conditions begin. If the PCs have left
corpses lying around, you might do a 1 in 8 check each turn to see if
they’ve been discovered (and an active search for intruders has
begun). And so forth.
Although the list of dungeon actions is fairly comprehensive for
the typical activities of adventurers, your players are creative and
the characters they’re playing are unique, so it’s quite possible
they’ll come up with some new exploration technique and start
using it regularly. If that’s the case, you may find it useful to
formally create a new dungeon action to handle it.
You can actually find an example of this way back in the original
1974 edition of D&D: Some characters had the ability to use ESP
(extrasensory perception) and would attempt to detect the thoughts

of monsters lurking around corners or on the far side of doors or
walls. Doing so was time-consuming, however, requiring a dungeon
turn.
More accurately, it required a quarter-turn. You can similarly
introduce half-turn and quarter-turn actions (with characters
being able to take two of the former or four of the latter each turn).
This will obviously increase the amount of bookkeeping you need to
juggle during play, but you may find that it’s worth the extra
complexity to be able to handle a broader range of discrete actions
with greater precision within the dungeon turn structure.
Personally, I don’t. But that’s really the point: You should play
around and find what works for you, for your group, and for the
adventure that you’re designing.

REWRITE THE RECIPE

Having a flexible, tried-and-true adventure recipe like the 5 + 5
Dungeon in your pocket is always useful, but it’s still just one recipe.
You don’t have the same thing for dinner every night, right? So as
you grow more familiar and comfortable with the dungeon
experience, you should feel empowered to start experimenting with
the recipe.
The ultimate goal, really, is to move beyond the 5 + 5 Dungeon
recipe entirely. With practice, you’ll eventually reach a place where
you can confidently create dungeons without any guidance at all,
just following the whim of your creative muse. As you’re looking for
your first steps along that road, however, you might want to start
out by tweaking the recipe a little bit here and there, just to see
what happens. (Add a little paprika to the egg salad, y’know?)
You could vary the number of rooms, maybe dropping rooms
from the recipe until you’re left with a fast-paced micro-dungeon
that the PCs can perform a fast hit-and-run on. Or you could add
extra rooms, perhaps to make the warlord’s headquarters feel more
important than the regional outposts the PCs have been chewing
their way through.

You can also play around with the archetype ratio. Maybe this
dungeon is tightly packed with featured rooms and fewer scenic
rooms, making it more of a 7 + 3 dungeon. (Or vice versa.) You
could double or triple up certain archetypes—having more fights or
more challenge rooms than usual—while dropping others.
Will you make mistakes while doing this? Absolutely. But you’ll
also learn a lot. Every dungeon you create and run will teach you
new lessons about dungeon design, about the game you’re playing,
and about what you and your players like.

DUNGEON LEVELS & THE 5 + 5 SEGMENT

As you begin designing larger dungeons, however, the 5 + 5
Dungeon recipe can still come in useful, because you can
conceptualize the dungeon as a collection of 5 + 5 Dungeons. Each
set of rooms becomes a segment, and these 5 + 5 segments can be
linked together in any number of ways.
A fairly straightforward method of doing this is to simply make
each 5 + 5 segment a separate level of the dungeon. Larger
dungeons frequently have multiple levels like this, with both
dangers and treasures traditionally increasing the deeper one delves.
Separate levels also often provide a natural demarcation between
different sections of the dungeon, which neatly correlates with the
idea of using separate 5 + 5 segments for each level. In other
words, even though there may be limited connections between
them, you can often think of each level as a “separate” dungeon,
making it much easier to organize and run them.
Once your dungeon has multiple levels, of course, you’ll need to
find ways to connect them so that the PCs can move up and down
between them. There are, fortunately, many different types of level
connectors you can use.
STAIRS
You know what stairs are. Let’s not be silly. But there are so many
different types to consider! Straight, spiral, L-shaped, U-shaped, and
helical. And that’s before you get really exotic with split stairs,

invisible stairs, folding stairs, inverted stairs, non-Euclidean stairs,
and anything else you might imagine of a fantastical nature.
SLOPES
Similar to stairs, but without the stairs. This sounds simple enough,
but in the absence of stairs, a long and gentle slope can transition
PCs between levels without them necessarily realizing they’ve
shifted elevation.
CHUTES
Vertical passages that cannot be traversed on foot. Chutes require
either climbing or flight.
LADDERS
Like a chute, but with a climbing aid already onsite. Variants of the
ladder include ropes, poles, pre-driven pitons, and antigravity fields.
TRAPDOORS
Trapdoors may lead to stairs, slopes, chutes, or ladders, but they
may also taunt PCs from the middle of a ceiling or drop down
directly into a lower chamber.
WINDOWS
Imagine a window looking down into a lower level of the dungeon.
(Perhaps with something looking back up at you!) You could also
have a vertical dungeon in which the PCs could fly up and find an
alternative entrance to an upper level by smashing through a more
traditional window.

TELEPORTS
Teleportation effects allow for rapid transit through larger dungeon
complexes, but they also have the potential to leave PCs disoriented

until they can figure out where they are at the other end. Teleports
can notably be either one-way or two-way.
TRAPS
Pit traps that drop PCs into an underground river three levels below.
One-way teleportation traps that leave them unexpectedly stranded
in a far corner of the dungeon (or staring at a familiar entrance, all
their progress lost). Greased slides that send them shooting down to
lower levels. Moving walls that shove them off subterranean cliffs.
Traps that force the PCs to enter a new level are usually designed to
be one-way trips, but sometimes resourceful characters can find a
way to reverse the journey nonetheless.
MULTI-LEVEL CHAMBERS
Large, vertical chambers can contain entrances leading to different
levels within the dungeon. For example, one might imagine
subterranean gorges or cliffs. Or an obsidian pyramid squatting in a
massive cavern, its steps leading to a burial chamber connecting to
an upper level.
ELEVATORS
In their most basic configuration, elevators are chutes with a selfpropelling means of passage, but taking a page from Star Trek‘s
turbolifts or Wonka’s Chocolate Factory suggests that elevators don’t
always have to be limited to a vertical plane. Others may require
the PCs to provide the means of propulsion. (A grinding wheel?
Magical fuel? Blood sacrifices? Mystic keys?) Another common
variant is the “sinking room,” reminding us that fantasy elevators
don’t need to feel like the Empire State Building, and may not exist
to serve the interests or comforts of their passengers.
BASKET & PULLEY
These are similar to elevators in their operation, but have the
distinction of allowing their passengers to directly observe their
surroundings for the duration of the trip. (The small size of the

“basket” might also suggest that entire adventuring parties may not
be able to take the journey at the same time.)
ETHEREAL TRAVEL
Sections of the dungeon may be designed such that normally solid
obstacles (like the floor) can be moved through by way of the
Ethereal Plane (or similarly transdimensional/non-Euclidean
egress).
RIVERS
A natural variant of the slope. If the river runs flush with the walls,
however, getting back upstream may require some tricky swimming.
(And if it runs flush with the ceiling, navigating the river may
require some deep breaths.)
UNDERWATER
In the real world, the fluid level in any connected system has to be
the same, which means that underwater journeys will be most useful
in moving PCs to different sections of the same level (or, at least,
different “levels” on the same horizontal plane). However, magic,
alchemy, steampunk technology, and science fiction gravity
manipulation can all provide any number of airlocks and semipermeable barriers allowing for underwater dives to the depths of
an otherwise dry dungeon.
Or possibly the PCs will be responsible for flooding those lower
levels when they breach a sealed door. (In a minor way if they’ve
just swum down a stagnant, submerged shaft. In a major way if they
dump an entire subterranean lake into the eighth level of the
dungeon.)

5 + 5 VALLEYS
Another classic formula for linking 5 + 5 Dungeon segments is
the 5 + 5 Valley: The PCs enter a valley, gorge, canyon, or the
like and they see that it’s lined with caves. There might be
three or six or twelve different caves, and each cave is a 5 + 5
Dungeon.
Many, but probably not all, of these cave mouths can be linked
to each other via underground tunnels and secret passages,
forming a much larger complex than is at first apparent.
One of the great things about a 5 + 5 Valley is that it really
emphasizes the importance of player choice in a compact
environment: They can see all of those cave entrances and it’s
entirely their choice which one they’re going to explore first.
They are masters of their own destiny.
This also makes it a good idea to distinguish at least some of
the cave entrances from each other so that the players have
some meaningful basis for making that decision. (If they don’t
have any way of distinguishing the cave entrances, it’s basically
just random.) That might be bloodstains, a foul smell
emanating from the mouth of the cave, strange pictorial
decorations, heads of the last party of adventurers foolish
enough to come this way displayed on spikes, an incomplete
treasure map, or any number of other possibilities.
COLLAPSED PASSAGES

A variant on the chute, stairs, shaft, slope, or passage. Or, rather,
where there used to be a chute, staircase, shaft, slope, or passage. Its
former existence may be obvious or it may be obfuscated, but it’s
going to require some excavation before the passage will be usable
again.
A common variant on this theme is the doorway that has been
deliberately bricked up or plastered over. It’s not unusual for such
passages to be obvious from one side but not the other.
TRANSPORT
Think Charon on the River Styx. Or harpies willing to carry women
(or men disguised as women; their eyesight is very poor) up a shaft.
Or a PC being sucked bodily into a fist-sized ruby, which is then
carried aloft by a silver raven. This form of connector has an
essentially limitless variety, but the basic idea is that the PCs are
being transported through the agency of an NPC or monster.
BEING SWALLOWED
“The cave is collapsing!” “This is no cave.” Esophageal jaunts to the
lower reaches of the dungeon should probably be used sparingly,
but will certainly be memorable when employed. (The vomitous
method of ascension is less pleasant, but no less memorable.)
BRUTE FORCE
Tunneling through walls using a stone shape spell. Levitating or
flying through “unreachable” vertical passages. Using gaseous form
to traverse “impassable” air vents. Blind or scry-prepped teleports.
Casting etherealness to phase through solid stone. This category is
basically a catchall for any and all methods PCs might use to find
paths where no paths were meant to be. This isn’t something you
can plan for (although you might encourage it by giving the PCs
maps as part of their treasure), but you should try to keep in mind
that they’re not cheating when they do it.
This attitude may be easier to hold on to, of course, if the
dungeon already has multiple paths to success designed into its nonlinear structure.

XANDERED DUNGEONS

To understand the importance of non-linear dungeon design, we
need to start by looking at the exact opposite—the linear dungeon.
Imagine a dungeon in which each room has exactly one entrance
and one exit. The size of the dungeon doesn’t really matter, because
it’s going to play the same way no matter what: You enter Room A,
then go through the only exit into Room B, then Room C, Room D,
and so on forever.

The sequence in which you encounter these rooms can never be
changed. More importantly, if you enter a room with an obstacle,
you have no choice but to overcome that obstacle before you can
continue exploring the dungeon: You can’t find an alternate route.
Or seek out resources that might help you. Or forge an alliance with
the beleaguered kobolds on Level 2 to help you overthrow the
tyrannical goblin gloomcaster!
Lost in this linearity is the true spirit of exploration. Such a
dungeon acts as a road. It’s a route planned by another. And
whereas Lewis and Clark were explorers, when I head down I-94, I
am merely a driver.
Also lost is the entire strategic component of the game, and with
it a great deal of the player creativity and spontaneity that make the
very best experiences at the gaming table. In many ways, in fact, the
players are no longer playing the game: They’re often reduced to
just doing what you tell them to do.
This, in turn, will put an enormous amount of pressure on you as
the dungeon master! If you’re going to force the players to do
specific things in a very specific order, then you’d better make sure

you literally never make a mistake. You give them a puzzle they
can’t solve? Or a monster that, for whatever reason, proves too
difficult for them to defeat? Then they’re stuck. The entire
adventure breaks.
But if the PCs can choose a different path? Then getting stuck in
Room B isn’t a problem. They can retreat, circle around, rush ahead,
go back over old ground, poke around, sneak through, interrogate
the locals for secret routes … The possibilities are endless because
the environment isn’t forcing them along a predesigned path. The
group instead becomes actively engaged in making the dungeon
their own, and through it all, instead of experiencing the canned
script of a theme park ride, they are living the thrill of true
exploration and discovery.
These complex, interwoven adventures are known as xandered
dungeons—dungeons that, being built on a non-linear foundation,
can support complex, creative, and strategic play. Designing such a
dungeon can seem daunting at first, but the reality is that xandering
a dungeon can be done by simply applying a few straightforward
techniques. Some of these techniques are designed to create
complex geographic scenarios (out of which meaningful choices can
naturally arise). Others are designed to confuse the players’
mapping of the dungeon (or, more generally, their understanding of
how the dungeon is structured). The point is not necessarily to
create a maze-like environment (although it can be) but rather to
create an environment of sufficient complexity so that the “hand of
the author” is obfuscated.
A xandered dungeon doesn’t just lack an intended path, it is
incapable of having one. This not only implicitly tells the players
that their choices are meaningful (because they are the ones charged
with creating their path), it also deepens the illusion of the game
world as a real place. Although the xandered dungeon is no more
difficult to run than any other dungeon, the emergent complexity of
its non-linear design will take the adventure in directions that you,
as the DM, could never have anticipated. Seeing this and knowing it

to be true, the players will perceive the things happening in the
game as being “real” events, not scripted contrivances.

XANDERING TECHNIQUES

The techniques used to xander a dungeon are a diverse collection,
ranging from those commonly and often used to the rare and exotic
options that are likely to define a dungeon experience. They should
not be mistaken for a features checklist. Your goal is not to cram
them all into every dungeon that you create. In fact, that may create
such a clamor that it will be difficult for the players to hear any
signal through the noise.
Instead, the next time you sit down to create a dungeon, consider
picking one or two of these techniques and really focusing on them.
You can go further, actually, and narrow your design theme down to
a specific, flavorful variant of a particular technique.
For example, perhaps the PCs are exploring an ancient city
studded with arcane brass elevators. Operating the elevators
requires inputting specific strings of strange symbols on keypads,
which correspond to the level the occupants wish to go to. The PCs
will be able to learn various symbol combinations via exploration or
experimentation. These would be a very specific example of an
unusual, discontinuous level connector (see here).
Whether common or exotic, the structural theming of the chosen
techniques will give the players something to latch on to. As they
figure out “how this dungeon works,” a very different form of
dungeon mastery will emerge, along with the satisfaction of being
able to use their knowledge to unlock secrets, gain strategic
advantage, solve puzzles, and avoid potential pitfalls.

LOOPS
Branching paths in a dungeon allow for choice but are still
functionally linear in their design. (In practice, the PCs will follow a
branch to its end, backtrack, and then go down a different branch.
But each branch still presents an independent linear experience.)
Where things start to get interesting is when you grab a couple of
those branches and hook them together into a loop so that Room A
leads to Room B that leads to Room C and so forth until you
eventually end up back in Room A. These loops are the basic
building blocks for xandered dungeons: They provide meaningful
strategic and tactical choices, make exploration impactful, and allow
PCs to find alternative routes around or through potential threats.
LOOPS WITHIN LOOPS: One loop is nice. It lets you approach
the goblin caverns from both directions. But it’s really when you
have multiple loops intersecting each other—loops within loops—
that truly dynamic navigation becomes possible in the dungeon.
MULTIPLE ENTRANCES
Multiple entrances give the PCs an immediate strategic choice as
they approach the dungeon complex. Hidden secondary entrances
also reward exploration both inside and outside the dungeon,
allowing for favorable approaches and quick escapes. Each entrance
allows the PCs to engage the dungeon in a different way, creating
unique experiences.
In terms of structure, multiple entrances effectively create an
additional “loop” through the surface above the dungeon.

MULTIPLE LEVEL CONNECTIONS
If there is only a single route leading to the next level of the
dungeon, then the complexity of the current level is collapsed into a
chokepoint. But if you introduce multiple connections between the
levels of a dungeon, you create a synergy between complex level
designs. Just as you create new structural loops by including
multiple entrances to the dungeon, each additional connection you
draw between levels creates new looping paths through the
dungeon.
DISCONTINUOUS LEVEL CONNECTIONS
In a linear design, the levels of a dungeon must proceed in their
predetermined order. Level 1 leads to Level 2. Level 2 leads to Level
3. Level 3 leads to Level 4.
But once you introduce multiple connections between levels, you
are free to have some of those connections skip levels. For example,
there might be a chute on Level 1 that takes you down to Level 3.
Or a hidden tunnel on Level 4 that takes you back to the surface a
half mile away from the dungeon’s main entrance.
From the players’ perspective, these discontinuous connections
obfuscate the geography of the dungeon. They know the chute goes
down … but does it go down to the same level as the stairs they
found earlier? This sort of confusion turns the navigation of the
dungeon into a puzzle to be solved. Will the maps they’re making at
the bottom of the chute connect to the map they made after going
down the stairs? Can they use what they learned via one route to
inform their explorations along another?
SECRET & UNUSUAL PATHS
These are fairly self-explanatory. They reward curiosity and
exploration, and secret and unusual paths can also breathe fresh life
into areas of the dungeon that have already been traversed.
Examples include:
camouflaged doorways
caved-in tunnels

traps that drop you to lower levels
archaic teleportation systems that must be decoded

rope bridges that cross over caverns that can be explored from
below
submerged bypasses connecting two seemingly unrelated lakes
Here, too, you will benefit from the non-linear design of the
xandered dungeon: Because there are other viable paths for the PCs
to explore, you can include truly esoteric, unusual, and flavorful
paths that may be missed by the unwary (and, therefore,
appreciated all the more by those who do discover them).
SUB-LEVELS
The distinction between a “level” and a “sub-level” of a dungeon is
somewhat arbitrary, but perhaps the defining characteristic is that it
departs from the main “sequence” of the dungeon. It may be smaller
than the other levels of the dungeon, difficult to reach, or both. As
such, sub-levels serve as boulevards of discovery or elaborate
shortcuts (or both).
Like discontinuous level connections, a sub-level interferes with
the players’ ability to intuit the structure of the dungeon. (“Wait …
is this the fourth level? Then where were we before?”) Your maps
and keys for the dungeon are all neatly numbered and organized for
ease of use and reference, but there should usually be nothing neat
or easy in exploring the dark places beneath the earth.
DIVIDED LEVELS
Similar to the concept of the sub-level is the divided level. While
existing within the main “sequence” of the dungeon, a divided level
cannot be completely traversed without going through the levels
above it or below it.
For example, on the third level of the dungeon you might find two
staircases going down to the fourth level. But on the fourth level
itself, there will be no path that connects the two staircases. (Or, if
there is such a path, it may be incredibly well hidden or difficult to

traverse.) The only way to get from one staircase to the other is to
either go back up to the third level or, alternatively, go farther
down and work your way back up. In your notes, such a level might
be labeled as Level 4A and 4B.
MINOR ELEVATION SHIFTS
When the PCs come to a staircase they may naturally assume that
they are going up or down to a new level of the dungeon. But by
including minor elevation shifts within the topography of a single
dungeon level, you can confound these expectations. For an extreme
example of this, look at the map on the next page.
In addition to short stairways and misleading slopes, you can also
include tunnels that loop under each other while technically
remaining on the same “level” of the dungeon in your map and key.
It’s also important to “think vertically” within rooms as well,
including a variety of ceiling heights, balconies, galleries, and the
like.
These techniques aren’t just a matter of confusing your players’
mapping. Once again, you’re disrupting their ability to deduce the
organization of your maps by analyzing the reality of the game
world. The entire concept of a dungeon “level” is really just for your
convenience as a DM; by understanding that and including things
like minor elevation shifts, you’re creating a world that not only
seems more dynamic and complex but actually is more dynamic and
complex.
Basically, don’t fall into the trap of thinking that because your
map is two-dimensional it means that the world should be twodimensional.

MIDPOINT ENTRY
You can also complicate the players’ approach to a dungeon by
creating immediate bilateral exploration. In other words, PCs
entering a dungeon are usually only faced with one navigational
question at the macro level: “How do we get down to Level 2?”
But if the PCs are instead entering in the middle of the dungeon
(even if they don’t realize that’s the case)—with levels above and
below them—then they’re first faced with a tougher question:
“Which way do we go?”
Note that this decision point is similar to the one faced by PCs
who have “skipped” a level as a result of a discontinuous level
connection. It’s also similar to the situation faced by PCs who have
taken advantage of a hidden entrance leading to a lower level of the
dungeon.
The distinction of the midpoint entry is that it’s the expected,
default entry point to the dungeon.

XANDERING IN PRACTICE

We’ve mostly been discussing xandering in the context of large
dungeons with multiple levels, but these principles are just as
valuable in making smaller dungeons, too. In fact, a smaller scale
can make the choices offered by xandering clearer and more sharply
focused for the players.
There can also be an impression that xandering the dungeon is an
artificial conceit—something that has to be “forced” into a scenario.
But in my experience exactly the opposite is true. Think about the
house where you live, the office building where you go to work, or
the mall where you do your shopping. Do any of these spaces have
only one possible entrance? Are they linear strings of rooms that can
only be entered in sequence? Prisons, banks, museums, schools. The
world around us is intensely xandered, and effortlessly so.
There are dangers, though, in overly xandering a dungeon.
There’s a point at which endless loops and countless connections
within the dungeon result in meaningless choice instead of
meaningful choice, and the goal is not that you should never use
branching paths or create chokepoints for accessing the lower levels
of the dungeon. Rather, such features should be used purposefully
instead of by default. Xandering techniques should be used for
specific effect, and you should beware the featureless sprawl of
looping corridors that can result from careless excess.
Here are a couple useful self-checks you can use.
DIFFICULT VS. EASY
Looking at your map, there should be areas of the dungeon that are
difficult to reach and areas that are easy to reach. I don’t just mean
isolated secret rooms (although there’s nothing wrong with those),
but rather large, significant regions of the dungeon.
In making this assessment, you’re diagnosing whether you’ve
made the dungeon too boring by making the choice of path through
the dungeon irrelevant. You want the dungeon to benefit from being
interconnected, but if everything in the dungeon trivially connects
to everything else then navigation becomes meaningless.
FAR VS. NEAR

Similarly, have the interconnections made your dungeon too
shallow? Look at where the PCs will be entering the dungeon. There
should be areas of the dungeon that feel far away from these
entrances. If everything in the dungeon feels equidistant, break
some of those connections or delve a little deeper in your design.
Note that “near” and “easy to reach” portions of the dungeon
aren’t problems to be eliminated. What you’re looking for is an
effective balance in the mix between all four of these design
elements (difficult, easy, near, and far).
DUNGEON LANDMARKS
The complexity of a properly xandered dungeon can leave
players feeling adrift, with one corridor of gray stone blending
seamlessly into every other. In some cases, this can be a
deliberate design decision and used to good effect, but most of
the time it’s more of a bug than a feature.
The solution is to include big, notable landmarks. When lost,
stumbling across a known landmark can help to reorient the
group. More importantly, such landmarks will help the players
form their mental map and, thus, their understanding of the
dungeon.
If you’re designing a dungeon with lots of unique, interesting
features, this will largely just take care of itself: The players
will glom on to whatever details particularly resonate with
them, and use those details to guide themselves. (On the other
hand, it can never hurt to do another quick pass through your
design and add in a few deliberate landmarks: a large
bloodstain. A unique statue. A room of strange runes.)

RANDOM ENCOUNTER TABLES

Random encounters are useful in any dungeon, but they become
particularly vital in large dungeons, where the conceit of monsters
all quietly waiting in their rooms for the PCs to show up can become
painfully apparent. Having integrated the encounter check into our
dungeon turn (see here) and discussed how to run encounters when
they’re generated (see here), it’s time to look at how you can create
your own random encounter tables.
The size of a random encounter table can vary quite a bit, and is
fairly dependent on the dungeon (or the section of the dungeon)
that you’re designing it for. I’ve designed dungeons that have four
entries on their random encounter table and I’ve designed dungeons
that have a hundred different encounters, although somewhere
between six and twenty encounters is far more common.
Once you know how many encounters will be on the table, you
just need to assign an appropriate die type. This is usually pretty
straightforward: If you’ve got six encounters, roll 1d6. If you’ve got
twenty encounters, roll 1d20. If you’ve got five encounters, then
either eliminate one (so you can roll 1d4), add one (so you can roll
1d6), or have one of the encounters occur on multiple dice results
(e.g., both 5 and 6).
If you’d like some encounters to occur more frequently than
others, you can either use a larger die type and assign those
encounters to multiple results or you can roll multiple dice in order
to generate a bell curve of probability (and then assign your
frequent encounters to the middle of the chamber). You can search
online for the probability of any combination of dice, but as an
example of what I mean, see the following page for the probability
table when rolling 2d6.

2D6 PROBABILITY TABLE

You can easily see how the encounter assigned to a roll of 5
(11.11%) is roughly four times more likely to occur than an
encounter assigned to a roll of 2.
Since the ends of this table become very unlikely to occur, it’s not
unusual for me to construct a table like this:
2D6

ENCOUNTER
PROBABILITY

2-3

8.33%

4

8.33%

5

11.11%

6

13.89%

7

16.67%

8

13.89%

9

11.11%

10

8.33%

11-12

8.33%

This still provides a bump for the encounters at the center of the
curve, but it evens out the odds of the least likely encounters. (Plus,
nine total encounters is a perfectly nice number of encounters to
have for a dungeon. Often more than enough.)
The real secret, though, is that you don’t really need to worry
about it that much. When in doubt, just use a flat die roll and call it
a day.
Far more important are the encounters you’re actually stocking
the table with. You can either prep bespoke encounters or
procedurally generated encounters.
Bespoke encounters, broadly speaking, are prepped just like any
other encounter in the dungeon: They are specific creatures who are
doing specific, predesigned things. For example:
COMPETITIVE ORCS: These five orcs are heading to the archery
range. Each is boasting about how well they will shoot and
making bets about which of them will score the most “eyeholes.”
(It appears their archery targets are made from skulls.) They are
accompanied by two goblins who are overburdened carrying
their bows, arrows, and other equipment. The group makes their
Dexterity (Stealth) and Wisdom (Perception) checks at
disadvantage due to their vociferous arguing.
Such encounters are less flexible and, once encountered, are
usually used up. (The PCs are not going to just keep encountering
more orcs arguing about their archery performance.) They are also
time-consuming to create and often result in a lot of wasted prep

(since you will likely end up creating bespoke encounters that don’t
get used).
The advantage of a bespoke encounter, however, is that it’s plug
and play. By spending the time to design the details of the
encounter before play begins, you don’t need to improvise those
details during play. Bespoke encounters also allow you to encode
specific rituals, events, or routines into the life of the dungeon.
Procedurally generated encounters, on the other hand, provide
you with the raw building blocks of an encounter, but then require
you to improvise the specific encounter based on the current
circumstances of the PCs and what’s happening in the dungeon at
that moment. (See Running Random Encounters on page 80.) If you
roll an encounter with “1d6 orcs + 1d4 goblins,” for example, then
those orcs might be on their way to the archery range; but they
could also be overseers escorting goblin miners to their duties or a
guard patrol or chefs delivering food to the mess hall.
Because these encounters can, in practice, be any number of
things, they are usually not used up. You can keep rolling “1d6 orcs
+ 1d4 goblins” forever, and each time the encounter can be
something fresh and new.
One common error, however, is to assume that this means
procedurally generated encounters can’t feature specific, named
NPCs. This is not the case. You could easily include a procedurally
generated encounter like “Warchief Skaglock + 1d4 orcs” on your
random encounter table, with the specific details of how and why
the warchief is being encountered being determined during play.
Whether using bespoke or procedurally generated encounters,
you’ll generally want to keep the difficulty manageable—what D&D
refers to as an Easy or Medium encounter. Random encounters, by
their nature, are generally scene setters, not the big finales.
This is easy to do if the encounter has a set number of monsters
(e.g., “five orcs and two goblins”). If you want to randomize the
number of creature encounters, it can get a little trickier.
1. Choose the creature type (e.g., orcs).

2. Determine how many of those creatures would qualify as an Easy,
Medium, and Hard encounter for the PCs. (With five 3rd-level
PCs, for example, these would be encounters with two orcs, four
orcs, and six orcs.)
3. Identify a dice range that fits your vision for the encounter. It can
cover the Easy and Medium ranges but should ideally not drift
into Hard unless it has a low probability of happening. If you’re
using multiple dice with a bell curve, I would generally try to get
the middle of that bell curve lined up with a Medium encounter.
(For our orcs, 1d4 or even 1d4 + 1 would seem to work well.)
If the encounter includes multiple creature types, this obviously
gets even trickier to juggle. I usually find it easiest to divide the XP
budget between the two creature types first and then determine the
appropriate range for each creature type.
Another option is to include combined encounters on your
encounter table. A common example is, “Roll again twice.” If you do
this, you’ll want to make really sure your encounters are landing in
the Easy/Medium range, because when multiple encounters
combine they’ll end up in Hard (and you don’t want them routinely
drifting into or past Deadly). Alternatively, keep your encounters
entirely in the Easy range, but make it very common (or even the
default) to combine multiple encounters.
The great thing about combined encounters is that they add an
even greater dynamic range to what can be procedurally generated:
Orcs + goblins inspires one encounter; orcs + pseudodragon a
different one.
WHERE DO THESE MONSTERS COME FROM?
When you roll up a random encounter in the dungeon, where
are these monsters coming from? I mean, it’s a fantasy game, so
they might be literally materializing out of thin air, but that’s
not likely to be a common scenario.

Option #1: They’re the monsters that appear on your dungeon
key; they just happen to be wandering around at the moment.
So if the PCs kill five orcs in a random encounter, then you
should delete them from a keyed encounter. (It can be useful to
list which keyed areas the random encounter “belongs” to on
your random encounter table.) If all the orcs in the dungeon
have been killed, then there are none to be randomly
encountered and you can ignore those results.
Option #2: There’s a separate pool of “wandering monsters”
who are just assumed to be moving around the dungeon at any
particular time. When the PCs kill five orcs in a random
encounter, delete them from the wandering monster pool. If the
pool runs out of wandering orcs, then you could either choose
to source them from keyed areas or, once again, ignore those
encounters.
Option #3: Wandering monsters are either not tracked or they
are explicitly “bonus” encounters. In a larger dungeon
(particularly a megadungeon), they might just be passing
through the area. In other situations you might rationalize the
variation in local population as drones returning to the hive or
some similar explanation. It’s also possible to just embrace the
quantum uncertainty: There is no definitive answer for exactly
how many goblins or giant bees or whatever live here until the
dice determine it through the course of play.

RESTOCKING THE DUNGEON

Let’s say that some people move out of their house. That house
won’t stay vacant forever, right? It probably won’t even stay vacant
for long.
That’s just what you’d expect from a real, living world.
Similarly, when the PCs clear the gibbering-mouther infestation
out of the Rainbow Grotto, they leave behind a perfectly nice set of

caves that could later be reinhabited by
tiefling bandits,
goblin nomads,

a fairy incursion from the Feywild,
a pack of blink dogs, or
giant fireflies.

Each poses an entirely new problem for the PCs to deal with.
But why would you do this? Why not create an entirely new
dungeon for every scenario?
First, you’ve got a perfectly good map of the Rainbow Grotto.
Reusing it can save you a bunch of work. This makes restocking a
particularly great option if your game starts in a couple of hours and
you haven’t had time to prep anything yet.
Second, the persistence of the world—and the consequences of the
PCs actions—will make the events of the campaign feel more real.
(If the PCs had taken the time to properly dispose of those gargoyle
corpses at the ruins of the cathedral, then the necromancer never
would have moved in and made gargoyle zombies.)
HELLO, NEIGHBOR!
Restocking a dungeon doesn’t always mean a new threat
moving in. In one of my campaigns, for example, the PCs
cleared out a haunted château and then took possession of the
property. They weren’t sure what to do with it, but a few
sessions later they’d become allies with a group of knights who
were suddenly being wrongfully hunted as outlaws. The PCs
offered the château as a hideout, and it soon transformed into
the headquarters for the rebellion.
You could similarly imagine a friendly elementalist moving into
the ruined tower outside the village and fixing it up. Or the

PCs’ smuggler friends using the old goblin caves to stash their
goods.
These benevolent repurposings are equally effective at making
the world feel like a real, persistent place where the PCs’
actions are meaningful and impactful.
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, it’s fun. Restocking a
linear dungeon with new monsters is often boring because you’re
just repeating the same mandatory grind. Restocking a non-linear
dungeon, on the other hand, gives the players a chance to leverage
their existing knowledge of the dungeon in myriad ways. (“Oh! I
know where we can set up an ambush for these goblins! Remember
that ledge where the tieflings were hiding?”)
Restocking a regular or micro-dungeon, while it can save you
some work, is largely similar to creating a whole new scenario.
Since the PCs will have likely “finished” the dungeon during their
first visit, they’ll have no reason to return, so you’ll need a fresh
scenario concept and scenario hook to pull them back in.
With bigger dungeons, on the other hand, restocking can become
part of the scenario. Because the PCs are making multiple
expeditions into the dungeon, the dungeon can evolve and change
between each expedition. This can be useful in large dungeons, but
really comes into its own with a megadungeon, where it becomes an
integral part of breathing life and fresh scenarios into the dungeon
environment. It also prevents, in combination with random
encounters, a “return to save point” mentality where the PCs, after
retreating from the dungeon, are free to just pick up from where
they left off, encouraging them to push forward and make as much
progress as they can on each expedition.
When thinking about restocking, I find it useful to break the
dungeon into zones. Methods for doing this can include:
Segments. If your dungeon is a collection of 5 + 5 Dungeon
segments, then you can treat each segment as a separate zone.

Levels. Each level of the dungeon can be treated as a separate
zone. If this ends up being too large to be useful, you could break
each level into quadrants (or some similar regular division).

Chokepoints. Look for the points in the dungeon that form
bottlenecks. The area between two or three chokepoints can form
natural zones, defined at least in part by the defensibility of those
rooms.
Lairs. In your original key, where were the different factions of
monsters living? Even once these have been cleared out (or
abandoned by their original inhabitants), they’re likely still
logical places for new creatures to potentially take up residence.
But the most important thing is that the dungeon’s zones make
sense to you. Not every room in the dungeon needs to belong to a
zone and, indeed, the zones may change and shift over time, but
there will be an internal logic to the dungeon and, once you
understand it, the zones will usually become obvious to you.
With your zones identified, you’ll make restocking checks. You’ll
usually make a check between each expedition into the dungeon,
but at your discretion you might also make a check if the PCs take a
long rest inside the dungeon.
The next thing to determine is which zones to check. There are
three options:
Empty Zones. Any zone that has been completely cleared by the
PCs (e.g., there are no denizens left in it) can be checked to see if
it becomes reinhabited.
Disrupted Zones. Check any zones the PCs entered or passed
through during their last expedition, including those that are still
inhabited (suggesting reinforcements, etc.). You might check only
disrupted zones (including empty zones the PCs entered), or you
might check disrupted zones in addition to all empty zones.
All Zones. Alternatively, you could check every single zone in the
dungeon, but this is usually not a good idea. It’s time-consuming
and will often result in the dungeon filling up with monsters at a

silly/ruinous rate. In addition, constantly churning, replacing, or
changing content that the players haven’t even seen yet is a waste
of time. (If they haven’t been to Level 5 of the dungeon yet, it’s
virtually always fine to leave everything down there in a state of
stasis until the PCs actually arrive and start interacting with it.
You can imagine that there’s a constant flurry of activity down
there just out of sight; but whatever you designed for Level 5 will
be the current state of things the first time the players arrive.)
As you check the zones, you can start with custom restocking.
This basically means doing cool stuff that spontaneously occurs to
you and/or developments that proceed logically from the events of
the game. For example, the PCs have been attacking the goblin lairs
on Level 2, and you think to yourself, “The goblins would probably
try to get help. Maybe they could hire some of the lizardmen
mercenaries from Level 4?” (Or from the far side of the mountain.
Restocking will often come from outside the confines of the
dungeon. It’s also quite possible that these lizardmen didn’t
previously exist in your campaign notes, but now you’ve created
them because you needed an answer to the question, “Where could
the goblins go for help?” This is one of the ways that restocking can
provide depth to your game world.)
You can also think of this as unprompted stocking, but that’s not
strictly accurate because it’s being prompted by literally everything
that happens during your game.
Once you run out of clever (or obvious) ideas, you can switch to
procedural restocking. As with random encounter checks, you can
customize your restocking procedure in a bunch of different ways,
but here’s a basic version you can start with:
1. Make a restocking check for each zone by rolling 1d8. A roll of
1 indicates that the zone will be restocked.
2. Roll on a stocking table to determine what denizens the zone
will be stocked with. Place these denizens where you feel it’s
appropriate. (If you don’t have a stocking table, you can often

use the random encounter table for the dungeon to similar effect.
Alternatively, just pick an appropriate denizen.)
3. Add appropriate minor treasure to the zone (usually carried by
the new denizens). Then roll 1d8, adding a major treasure on a
roll of 1. (Some games will have systems for randomly generating
treasure, in which case you can use those. If not, you’ll have to
create bespoke treasure hordes using your best judgment.)
A common variant to this procedure is to make a zone-based
check to see if the zone should be restocked, but then making
stocking checks and/or treasure checks for each individual room. (If
you generate treasure in an unoccupied room, that usually means it
will be hidden or secured in some way.)
But why use procedural stocking at all? Why not just have events
in the dungeon proceed logically? Well, what I like about stocking
checks—just like random encounters—is that they act as improv
seeds. It can be a little too easy to just say that nothing will happen
in an empty dungeon zone. The procedural stocking will provide the
push to keep things in motion and inject the unexpected into your
creative process.
POOR MAN’S STOCKING TABLE
As I mentioned, procedural stocking is a lot easier if the game
you’re playing includes stocking tables—i.e., tables for
randomly generating dungeon denizens and/or treasure.
Unfortunately, there are many RPGs that lack these tools.
With a little effort you can create your own tables for any
game, but I’m quite lazy, so there are a couple of improvised
techniques I’ve used to good effect.
First, you can often use a random encounter table to similar
effect. If possible, I usually get better results from going one
step up from whatever I’m trying to stock. For example, if I’m
restocking a dungeon level, I could use the random encounter

table for that level, but I might get better results if I were to
randomly choose a dungeon level’s encounter table to roll on
or, instead, use the wilderness encounter tables (see here) for
the region the dungeon is located in. (These options allow the
region around the area I’m restocking to influence the
outcome.)
Second, you can transform almost any monster book into a
random table by randomly rolling a page number and, if
necessary, then randomly choosing a monster on the matching
page. (Online dice rollers make it easy to randomly generate a
number in any given range.)
In games like D&D, which can have opponents spread across a
wide range of difficulties, you probably don’t want to randomly
select any creature, but it’s usually pretty easy to narrow the
range. In D&D, for example, you can use the “Monsters by
Challenge Rating” list, select a target challenge rating, and then
randomly select a monster from the list. For a broader range,
choose a target challenge rating (usually two CRs lower than
the average party level) and then roll 1d3-1d3 to select a
specific CR.
The Dungeon Master’s Guide also includes a list of creatures by
terrain type, which can be used to similar effect.

UPDATING THE DUNGEON KEY

Updating the dungeon key is often done hand in hand with
restocking: As new denizens move into an area, they’ll clean up the
wreckage left in the wake of the PCs, reset the traps, change the
décor, set up a dark fane harnessing necromantic energies to open a
nethergate to the Null Realms … you know, the usual.
But updating your key is also about reflecting the actions of the
PCs. It is the wreckage they leave behind—the bodies, the graffiti on

the walls, the smashed doors, and looted tombs. It’s a reference so
that, when they circle back through this area again, they can see the
impact that their actions have had.
During play, I find it useful to quickly jot down notable additions
or changes to the key right in my notes. In some cases, this
marginalia is sufficient by itself, but I usually find it useful to spend
a couple minutes after a session briefly reviewing everything that
happened and making sure I’ve taken notes on everything relevant.
When the required notes exceed the marginalia, I’ll prep a
scenario update, which works kind of like a diff file. This
document just lists each altered room of the dungeon and the things
that have been changed in that room. For example, if the PCs were
in Area 5 of Mephits & Magmin (see here) and they looted the
Stygian crystals, I’d write something like:
AREA 5
crystals looted
You don’t need to get any more complicated than that. The idea is
that you can check the diff file, see that the crystals have been
removed, and then modify your description of the room while
primarily referring to the original key entry.
(Mephits & Magmin is a small enough dungeon that I probably
wouldn’t need to actually do this, but it serves as an easy example.
And if some new denizens were to move into the dungeon in the
future, perhaps it would be relevant!)
Maintaining a collection of these diff files for your various
dungeons and dungeon levels may be the beginning of maintaining
a campaign status document. For more information and best
practices for these, check out the extra credit on page 448.
A more comprehensive option is to create a new dungeon key.
I’ll generally do this only if the diff file is chewing up too much
space or has become too onerous to use smoothly and accurately.

Basically, though, you just take your notes from the diff file and
rewrite the key, creating a completely fresh document that’s more or
less indistinguishable from a brand-new adventure.
For example, using the same update to Area 5 of Mephits &
Magmin, I might rewrite the key for that room as:

AREA 5: VOLCANIC CRYSTALS

At one end of this long chamber there is an archway in one corner
and a large tunnel slanting down from the opposite corner.
The far end of the chamber from these passages is filled with a
huge, crystalline growth. Although it appears a number of crystals
have been damaged, there are still hundreds of individual crystals in
the mass, each glowing with a spectral, greenish light that casts
strange shadows down the fissured walls.
INTELLIGENCE (INVESTIGATION)-DC 12 (FOOTPRINTS)
A close inspection of the floor may reveal that there are small,
humanoid footprints that have been burned into the surface. They
are difficult to make out against the dark stone and crisscross each
other countless times, but clearly pass through the entrances to Area
4 and Area 8. (They do NOT pass into Area 6, which is unknown to
the magmin.)
GM Note: These footprints are made by the magmin. They are not
found in the lava tubes, where the undisturbed volcanic rock is
solid enough to not be disturbed by them.
INTELLIGENCE
(INVESTIGATION)-DC
15
(CONCEALED
PASSAGE)
Although it is not immediately apparent, one of the fissures in the
south wall is actually large enough to squeeze through, allowing
characters to crawl through to Area 6 with a successful DC 12

Dexterity check. (This check is made with advantage if the character
is not wearing armor.)
CRYSTALS
A DC 12 Intelligence (Nature) check indicates that these are
volcanic crystals, while a DC 15 Intelligence (Alchemist’s Supplies)
check reveals these crystals have been adulterated with Stygian gas,
granting them their strange illumination and also making them a
valuable catalyst for various alchemical procedures. It appears that
all of the crystals with adulterations strong enough for alchemical
work—several dozen in all—have been removed.
GM Note: The crystals were harvested by Asuvius and, later, the
Red Elk adventuring party.
WALLS
Close inspection of the walls will reveal that they were not carved
but rather somehow melted into their current configuration.
Compare this to the original key entry on page 56 and note the
subtle differences. Obviously, it’s quite common for dungeon rooms
to have much more radical changes: The crystals were completely
smashed apart and scattered across the floor, the narrow entrance to
Area 6 has been blasted open, or the magmin have draped the body
of the PCs’ dead companion over the crystalline mass as a warning.

STARTING A MEGADUNGEON

Large dungeons aren’t that different from single-session dungeons,
and it’s pretty easy to slowly expand your dungeon scenarios as you
explore their new dynamics.
A megadungeon, on the other hand, can feel like a completely
different beast altogether. Enough adventures to fill an entire
campaign? A dozen or more levels? Hundreds of rooms? How can
you possibly come to grips with all that?
The secret is that you don’t have to. You really only need to prep
enough of the megadungeon to run your first session. Then you can

expand the megadungeon only as you need to, slowly delving
deeper and deeper into the netherworld.
The generic rule of thumb is that you should start by prepping the
first three levels of your megadungeon, but I find it useful to
understand why that’s a good rule of thumb: You want enough
material that the PCs aren’t likely to simply skip their way into an
area you haven’t prepped in the first session.
In short, take a look at your maps and assume a worst-case
scenario in which the PCs make a beeline directly from the entrance
to the nearest set of stairs, then from those stairs to the next. In a
single session, it’s likely they’ll chew through a dozen rooms or so.
You’ll want a healthy margin of error, though, just in case, so
assume they might make it through a couple dozen. How far can
they get?
For your first session, the answer is likely to be, “Somewhere on
the third level.” (Hence the rule of thumb.) In practice, they
probably won’t. But they could. And sometimes they will. Even if
they don’t, knowing what the next chunk of the dungeon contains is
usually valuable context for running the current chunk of dungeon
(e.g., the goblins can talk about the lizardmen mercenaries on the
next level).
Where this analysis becomes even more useful, though, is after
the first session. Look at how far the PCs penetrated last time.
Assume that they continue their exploration of the dungeon from
that point and ask yourself, once again, “How far can they get?”
That’s the chunk you need to prep next, and you can continue biting
off chunks of the dungeon like this until, sooner than you might
think, you’ll start hitting sessions where the answer to “How far can
they get?” is “No farther than I’ve already prepped.” And that’s a
great moment, because it’s at that moment that the megadungeon
settles down and you’ll find the momentum of the campaign driving
itself forward, with you only needing to apply the slightest bit of
steering to keep things rolling.

MEGADUNGEON LEVELS = DIFFICULTY
In the traditional megadungeon, each level would correspond
to a matching level of difficulty. So the first level of the
megadungeon would have challenges appropriate for 1st-level
characters, the second level would have challenges for 2ndlevel characters, and so forth.
There’s no reason to strictly adhere to this concept, but it’s not
a bad guideline—for both practical and thematic reasons—that
the deeper you go into the megadungeon, the more difficult
and dangerous it will become. This can give you guidelines for
the types of creatures to be found on each level, and it’s also a
useful limiter when you’re prepping your megadungeon starter:
Even if the 1st-level PCs want to do (or, through dumb luck,
stumble into doing) a speedrun down to the third level of the
dungeon, they won’t be able to make much progress down
there against high-CR challenges (and would be well advised to
retreat and spend some time exploring the upper levels).
Going in blind as you create your megadungeon and kind of
exploring it the same way the PCs will (so that, for example, you
don’t know what’s on Level 6 until your maps delve down to that
depth) can be a lot of fun, but you can also lay out a grand plan of
your megadungeon, even if you’re prepping it in chunks.
The most basic way to do this is to list the levels of the
megadungeon. For example:
Level 1: Goblin Warrens
Level 2: Lakes of the Sahuagin
Level 3: Nothic Druids
Level 4: Chaos Caverns

Level 5: Hobgoblins & Hell Hounds
Level 6: The Nymphaeum Gates

Level 6A: Mastaba of the Mephit Lords
Level 7: Four Elemental Sacraria
Level 8: Sepulcher of Gloom

From this list you could even sketch a rough side view of the
dungeons, using xandering techniques to rough out the connections
between levels.

DYNAMIC DUNGEONS
We’ve added scale and complexity to our dungeons, but that’s not
the only way to add depth to a scenario. We can also create
dynamic dungeons in which the denizens actively respond to what
the PCs are doing.
One of the great things about a location crawl is that each keyed
area is effectively “firewalled.” By default, the only thing you need
to think about while running the scenario is the room that the PCs
are currently in. This makes running a location crawl incredibly
easy, because everything you need can be right at your fingertips.
The drawback, of course, is that this results in a very static
scenario. If the PCs are fighting the goblins in Area 43, it feels like
the goblins in Area 44 should hear them and come rushing over to
help their compatriots. But because they’re behind the firewall—
because the DM is only focusing on Area 43—they don’t.
So you think to yourself, “Okay. When there’s a fight, I should
scan nearby rooms to see if there’s anyone who might hear what’s
happening.”
And if you’ve gained enough experience as a DM, and if there are
only one or two rooms nearby, you can probably make that work.

It’s definitely harder—you’re having to flip back and forth between
different room keys—but it’s manageable.
But what if there are more than a couple rooms? What if there are
five or six or ten rooms within potential earshot? And what if,
instead of being Areas 43 and 44, right next to each other in your
notes, they’re Areas 43, 44, 52, 53, 57, and 84?
Oof. That’s getting a lot harder to juggle, and we’ve just gotten
started. So far we’ve only considered the simple case of having the
bad guys hear the fight and then come rushing to help. What if the
modron in Area 57 decides the most logical course of action would
be to fetch additional reinforcements? Where would it go to find
them? Now you’re not just flipping around trying to find nearby
denizens to activate, you’re flipping through the whole dungeon
trying to figure out where the nearest barracks is. And what would
the response of the goblins in the barracks be? And what other areas
will they affect or be affected by?
You can see how quickly this becomes completely untenable, even
for the most experienced DMs. To run truly dynamic dungeons and
bring them to life, we can’t just try to run all the rooms in the
dungeon at once. The firewall is too valuable. Instead, we need a
fundamentally different approach and a new set of tools to make it
work.
We’ve actually already taken our first steps in this direction by
using random encounters, and these will remain a useful part of our
arsenal even as we add more weapons to it.

ADVERSARY ROSTERS

It’s virtually impossible to keep track of all the denizens in a
dungeon of even moderate size because the information describing
them has been scattered across the key and embedded into dozens
of room descriptions. We do this because we think of the denizens
as “belonging” to a particular room. They’re “the goblins in the
library” or “the security guards in the ops center.”

Of course, our whole goal with a dynamic dungeon is to not have
the denizens tied down to a specific room. We want them free to
move around the dungeon and respond to events in the way that
real people do. So what we need is a different way of keying
denizens and tracking them in the scenario.
We can do this with an adversary roster, a list of the dungeon
denizens separate from the room key. If we were to build a roster
for Mephits & Magmin, for example, it would look like this:
EXAMPLE MEPHITS & MAGMIN-ADVERSARY ROSTER
ACTION GROUP

AREA

4 mud mephits

Area 1

2 smoke mephits +
1 steam mephit

Area 2

Work Crew: 2
magmin + 2 mud
mephits

Area 8

2 magma mephits

Area 9

Asuvius + 2 magmin
+ 2 smoke mephits

Area 10

Steampowered
Construct

Area 10

NOTES

(moving between
Areas 8 & 10)

(needs to be fully
charged)

If you’re using an adversary roster, the denizens listed on the
roster should NOT be included in the location key. In practice, you’ll
have the adversary roster on a separate sheet of paper—ideally
placed off to one side for easy reference—and use it to keep track of
where the adversaries are. For example, when the PCs enter Area 9,
you’d flip to the room key but also cross-reference the adversary
roster, see that there are two magma mephits there, and add them
to the room description.

More than that, you can use the adversary roster to move
denizens around the dungeon in real time. Maybe the steam mephit
in Area 2 flees the PCs and bolts to Asuvius in Area 10 to report the
intruders. You notice the work crew cycling between Area 8 and
Area 10, so you have Asuvius call them over as they deliver their
elemental seeds and send them out as a patrol to locate the PCs.
Or maybe something completely different. These aren’t scripted
events. The point is that the adversary roster empowers you to
actively play the dungeon in response to the PCs’ actions.
This does increase the complexity of running the scenario, but it’s
not the exponential, cascading increase that we saw earlier. You’re
no longer strictly looking at the current room key, but rather than
trying to juggle five dozen location keys all at once, you can
generally limit yourself to looking at just the current room key and
the adversary roster. In other words, two discrete chunks of
organized information instead of a chaotic multitude.
THE FOG OF WAR
One pitfall you can fall into when using an adversary roster is
having everybody in the dungeon immediately swarm the PCs.
Sometimes that’s the logical outcome of the PCs’ actions and
that’s fine. (They’ll quickly learn to take approaches that don’t
result in that outcome and retreat and regroup if it does.) But
you should bear the fog of war in mind: Even if the PCs attack
one action group, it doesn’t necessarily mean that everyone in
the location will immediately know what’s happening, and
even if the alarm does go up, some action groups may be
assigned to guard other areas or simply have no idea exactly
where the crisis is happening.
The adversary roster gives you the opportunity to roleplay the
entire dungeon. Seize that opportunity! Really think about
what each denizen—or group of denizens—knows, and what
they would do with that knowledge.

The fundamental building block of the adversary roster is the
action group. You rarely want to track every single individual in
the dungeon separately, so you group them together for easy
management. (Although some of your action groups can, of course,
consist of a single individual if that’s appropriate.) Most of the time,
an action group will consist of all the adversaries in a single location
at the beginning of a scenario, but sometimes you’ll want to take a
particularly large group and split them into smaller units. You can
think about this in purely utilitarian terms: Do you think that the
group is likely to split up and take independent action? Then it
should be two action groups.
For example, if you’ve got twenty orcs bunking in the barracks,
you might split them up into four action groups with five orcs each
so that they can split up or be sent as guards to different areas of the
compound.
For ease of use and reference, you can also label and/or number
each group. A label is mostly useful as a keyword and reminder: If
you see a Death Squad and a Perimeter Guard on your adversary
roster, it’ll be a helpful reminder of how each group will behave and
respond.
ACTION GROUP STAT SHEETS
You might find it useful to prep stat sheets for some or all of your
action groups. Just put the stat blocks for all the denizens in the
group on a single sheet of paper. When the PCs run into an action
group, simply grab the matching stat sheet for easy reference during
play. That way you won’t need to flip back and forth between
multiple pages in your books and notes—all the information you
need will be right at your fingertips.
ACTION GROUP TYPES
Action groups tend to fall into one of four types, defined by their
typical behavior. Classifying them like this on your roster will make

it easier for you to quickly figure out how each group should behave
during play.
Patrols make regular circuits through a location. This can be
indicated by keying their route (Patrol Areas 1, 5, 7, 8, 9, 2, 1). In
some cases, I find it useful to create a separate Patrol Roster (if
there are multiple patrols or if their routes are particularly
complicated for some reason).
Mobile groups are the default. These are keyed to a specific
location, but are generally willing and able to respond to the
activities of the PCs.
Mostly Stationary groups, on the other hand, are unlikely to
leave the area they’re keyed to. This might be a choice on their part
(they won’t respond when the alarm is raised for whatever reason)
or it may not (they’re dire wolves locked in a kennel). Adversaries
waiting in ambush are another common example of this type.
Because there is the possibility for these action groups to become
mobile (e.g., someone releases the dire wolves), however, I will
include them on the adversary roster, but indent their entries to
clearly distinguish them from more active elements.
Stationary adversaries will never leave the location they’re in. As
a result, these adversaries are NOT included on the roster and,
instead, still appear in the room key. (Because they will only be
encountered in that location, there’s no reason to clutter up the
roster with them.) This might include literally immobile creatures,
those simply uninterested in the rest of the complex, or creatures
that are sealed away until the PCs disturb them (at which point, if
they aren’t immediately destroyed, you might choose to add them to
the roster).
These distinctions—particularly those between Mostly Stationary
and Stationary—are purely utilitarian. They don’t represent some
deep or universal truth about the game world. Think about how you
want to use a particular group of adversaries during play and then
classify them appropriately. (If it turns out you were wrong, it’s easy
enough to just ignore the indentation, right?)

ADVANCED ADVERSARY ROSTERS

I recommend running some typical dungeons using the basic
adversary rosters described above to get a feel for how they can be
played with at the table. Then you can add in some of these
advanced options when you need them.
VARIABLE AREAS
Action groups don’t need to be limited to a specific area. The feudal
lord might be in his throne room or his bedchambers. A wizard
might be studying in the library or working in his laboratory. An orc
sergeant might rotate through the barracks of his minions.
ROSTERS ON THE MAP
In addition to the roster, you can also lay the dungeon map out
in front of you like a table mat. (You could even print the roster
on the same sheet as your map if there’s room.)
If you’ve numbered your action groups, you can now grab
matching tokens, put them on the map, and manage your
adversaries in real time. Just move them around the map as the
situation demands.
(Numbered counters are fairly easy to find. You can also make
your own by printing out numbers and affixing them to
washers or quarters or the like.)
If you’re using a virtual tabletop, it can be even easier to set
this up: If you do the prep work to place all of your monsters
on the scenario map before play begins, you can just zoom out
and manage them in real time.
There are a few ways to show this on the adversary roster:

Area 21 or Area 40. Here you simply list the options and can
choose whichever one feels appropriate or dramatic during play.
(Or, perhaps, they’ll just be in whatever area the PCs affect or
explore first.)
Area 21 (1-2) or Area 40 (4-6). The location is randomly
determined, in this case by rolling 1d6.
Area 21 (day) or Area 40 (night). The group’s location is
dependent on the listed circumstances. A division of night and
day is common.
A trap to avoid falling into here is attempting to minutely script
every detail of the daily lives of every NPC. You really want to focus
on establishing a typical starting condition for the location and let
all those minor details flow out during play, using variable areas for
NPCs only when it’s particularly significant.
Another thing to keep in mind is that you can often simulate the
activities of a compound without complicating the roster. For
example, if the guards at the front gate of the mansion work sixhour shifts and then get relieved, you probably don’t need to include
all four shifts of guards. Functionally speaking, the mansion has one
guard (although the name of that guard might be different
depending on what time of day the PCs show up).
NOTES/FOOTNOTES
You can include additional information or cross-referencing by
adding notes as a third column on your adversary roster, using
footnotes, or both. This can include:
Adversaries carrying a specific piece of equipment. (This is useful
when you have a bunch of cultists all using the same stat block,
but only some of them—or one of them—is holding the Red Key
of Hrathlar. Otherwise, of course, you’d just list their common
equipment in their stat block.)

Brief tactical notes. (Stuff like “can be telepathically summoned
by the mind flayer” or “will usually wait to launch prepared
ambush” or “can see through walls.”)
If they’ve been classified as Mostly Stationary, why they’ve been
classified that way (sleeping, in ambush, indifferent, etc.).
Other notes regarding their activities (polymorphed to look like
prisoners, playing poker, torturing Sebastian, etc.).

I generally use a notes column if the notes are brief enough to fit
on one line. I use footnotes for longer stuff, or if they only apply to
individual characters in larger action groups.
MULTIPLE ROSTERS
For some scenarios, you may want to prep multiple rosters. For
example, you might have one roster for Day and another for Night.
Or a Normal status and an Alert status.
Creating multiple rosters is usually only worth the effort if the
location radically shifts as a result. If the differences are minor or
isolated to a handful of characters, then you can probably stick to
using conditionals for individual action groups. It’s also useful to
double-check and make sure there’s some sort of player-facing
significance to the different roster states. If the players are unlikely
to ever notice the difference between Lord Duchamp’s Mansion in
the Morning and Lord Duchamp’s Mansion in the Midafternoon,
that’s probably a good indication that you only need one roster that
captures a “good enough” estimation of a typical day at Lord
Duchamp’s mansion.
SPLIT ROSTERS
There’s a practical limit to how large an adversary roster can
become. Once you get a sufficiently large number of action groups,
it becomes difficult to manage them. Personally, I find that number
to be around 15 to 20 (and by the time I reach 25, I’ve usually
reached my limit). Your mileage may vary, but there’ll eventually be
a breaking point.

Larger complexes can sometimes be broken down into smaller
sections to make them manageable. (You could have different
adversary rosters for each level of a dungeon, for example, if there’s
limited movement between the levels.) There can also be conceptual
breakdowns that you can use to divide your adversary roster into
more usable chunks. (For example, you might separate the VIPs
from the Security Patrols, making it easier to spot and use the active
response teams.)
ROSTERS & RANDOM ENCOUNTERS
In location crawls, I will generally choose to use either random
encounters or adversary rosters, but not both. After all, I don’t need
to randomly determine if the security guards stumble on the PCs if
I’m tracking the precise location of the security guards in real time.
For smaller location crawls, I usually prefer adversary rosters. It’s
just more fun and, in my experience, more effective to actively play
the entire scenario with real-time strategy. When a location becomes
large enough that the adversary roster becomes unmanageable,
though, I’ll often swap back to random encounters as a more
efficient way of modeling the dynamic life of the complex.
Hybrid approaches, where you use an adversary roster but also
make random encounter checks, can also be useful, particularly in
situations where you’re using split rosters. For example, if the PCs
are on Level 4 of a large dungeon and you’re using a split adversary
roster that only includes the monsters on that level, you might use a
random encounter check with a low encounter chance to generate
any monsters “passing through” from another area of the dungeon.
An example of another hybrid approach from my own campaign
was the Bloodpool Labyrinth. In this dungeon there were a limited
number of monstrous patrols, but the focus of the scenario was on
navigating the labyrinth and its many nonmobile hazards keyed to
specific rooms. As a result, I chose to run the patrols using a random
encounter table instead of trying to track them in real time.
One thing to keep in mind is that random encounters put pressure
on the PCs. If you find that pressure fading away because your

adversary roster is too passive, you can also use a random encounter
check to prompt you, on a successful check, to have one of the
action groups become active (i.e., move to a new location). You can
also design patrols into your adversary roster, moving them along
their paths once per dungeon turn at the same time as (or in place
of) your encounter checks.
ROSTER RESTOCKING
Using adversary rosters can also make it fairly trivial to restock your
dungeons (see here) as the denizens are killed, replaced, or retasked. Because you’ve separated the denizens from the key, you
don’t need to go through and re-key every room to update the
denizens. You can just create a new adversary roster, often using the
exact same key (with perhaps minimal changes to reflect other
changes to the complex).
PASSIVE LOCATIONS
As a final note, adversary rosters are a technique for locations with
active bad guys. Not every dungeon needs a roster. Sometimes the
PCs really are cracking open dusty tombs that have lain undisturbed
for centuries and they have only themselves to blame when they
awaken the eldritch horrors within. Variety is the spice of life, and
good scenario design is often about finding the right tool for the job.

DYNAMIC ENCOUNTER DESIGN

Once you start running dynamic dungeons, you’ll need a different
methodology for encounter design.
When you’re running static dungeons with isolated encounters,
you need each individual encounter to be challenging in its own
right. Because the players are more or less free to reset their
resources after each encounter, every fight needs to push the PCs to
the brink and threaten disastrous defeat, because what would be the
point otherwise?
When you’re running a dynamic dungeon, on the other hand, the
primary challenge comes not from the tactics of the individual

encounter (although those are still important), but from the strategy
of the entire dungeon. It’s not enough to win the battle; you have to
win the war. It’s a richer and deeper style of play.
A core concept here is combining encounters. An obvious
consequence of running a dynamic location with adversary rosters
or similar tools is that multiple action groups can join a single
encounter. If you design each action group as if it were a skin-ofyour-teeth static encounter, then when two or more of those action
groups merge into a single dynamic encounter, they’ll annihilate the
PCs.
What you generally want instead are action groups that, if
encountered alone, are relatively easy encounters, but that can
become increasingly dangerous encounters if they are allowed to join
together. This means that you, as the DM, don’t need to pull the bad
guys’ punches, which, in turn, creates a strategically interesting
scenario, baking in the default strategic goal of “don’t let them gang
up on us.” (This is a fairly basic goal, but one that invites multiple
potential
solutions
depending
on
circumstance—stealth,
overwhelming strikes, negotiation, etc. And it forms a firm
foundation on which more complicated strategic goals can be built.)
Here are the principles of dynamic encounter design:
You rarely want an encounter with One Big Bad Guy™. (These can
be a nice change of pace, but single opponents are difficult to
keep balanced and tactically interesting against a gaggle of PCs.)
It’s better to have encounters with lots of opponents in order to
provide tactical complexity.
Encounters with a single action group will likely have little
immediate risk, but they still require some strategic ablation of
resources. (The PCs should lose a few hit points, need to cast
some of their spells for the day, etc. In other words, these
encounters should be able to wear them down over time.)
Two or three action groups should be able to join together and be
a challenging encounter, but rarely a risky one.

If four or five action groups join together, the PCs should still be
able to win the fight, but it may be touch and go and/or require
some clever thinking by the players. (You’ll be helped here
because such encounters often develop over time, with the fourth
or fifth action groups joining in the middle of combat, which
means the PCs won’t be facing all the bad guys at the same time.)
What you can see from these principles is that a dynamic dungeon
empowers you to have a larger range of potential encounters
(ranging from the easy to the extremely difficult) without any of
those encounters becoming meaningless filler.
Exactly how these principles will apply in a specific roleplaying
game will vary depending on exactly how that game is designed. In
the current edition of D&D, it boils down like this:
Most of your action groups should be designed as Easy
encounters, spiked with the occasional Medium action group. A
ratio of 2:1 or 3:1 is probably right most of the time.
Use Hard action groups sparingly. (The key thing to remember is
that a couple of Hard action groups joining up together can very
easily become an ultra-lethal encounter.)

Deadly action groups should almost never be used. You’re almost
always better off letting such encounters emerge from the
strategic flow of the scenario. (But this does mean that when you
roll out the very rare Deadly encounter, particularly in nondynamic situations, you’ll get real bang for your buck.)
If the game you’re looking to apply these principles to gives you
concrete guidelines for gauging difficulty, you can probably use
those as a basis for dialing in the encounter design that you need. If
it doesn’t, then you may need to do some experimentation to figure
out what easy, challenging, and potentially overwhelming
encounters look like and the various ways you can split them apart
into effective action groups.

As always, your group’s mileage may vary. Clever and resourceful
players, in particular, may find ways to dominate your dungeons. If
that’s happening regularly at your table, feel free to crank things up
a bit until you find the sweet spot for you and yours (keeping in
mind, as always, that you have to miss by a lot and for a fairly long
time for “too easy” to ruin your campaign). It may also be useful to
remember that successfully slipping through a situation unscathed
that you know could have turned into a complete clusterfuck can be
a thrilling, edge-of-your-seat experience in its own right. (And a
perhaps welcome change of pace from all the clusterfucks that will
inevitably happen in other scenarios.)
One of the key things to really grok about a dynamic dungeon is
that, to at least some extent, it gives the players a degree of control
over the encounters they face. With sufficient strategic cleverness,
they can even “design” their own encounters—keeping encounters
easy by preventing action groups from joining up, luring enemies to
locations of their choosing, and so forth. This is very different from
a static dungeon where the encounters are locked to specific rooms
and you, as the DM, are solely responsible for designing every
aspect of them. In a dynamic dungeon, it’s not your job to crush the
PCs; it’s your job to set the stakes high and give them the
opportunity to screw up and push themselves to the breaking point.
PRECIOUS ENCOUNTER DESIGN
Some RPGs are not designed for strategic-based play and,
therefore, struggle with dynamic encounter design. These are
sometimes referred to as tactics-based or tactical RPGs, and you
can usually identify them because they provide mechanics that
trivially allow the PCs to fully restore their resources at the end
of each fight. (The game becomes tactics-based because,
mechanically at least, it’s designed to isolate each encounter
with no long-term strategic impact as a result of how a
particular encounter is resolved.) The fourth edition of D&D,
unlike other versions of the game, was designed like this.

The problem is that without the strategic ablation of resources,
encounters that don’t carry some significant risk of wiping out
the PCs become meaningless (since any losses incurred will just
reset when the encounter is finished). Conversely, of course,
encounters that are too difficult and would wipe the PCs out
remain nonviable. The result is that tactical RPGs have a very
narrow and very specific difficulty that has to be hit with every
single encounter, and this is simply incompatible with having
multiple action groups fluidly moving around and combining
with each other. When your encounters are balanced on a
knife’s edge, unexpected reinforcements are always ruinous.
If you’re running a tactical RPG, therefore, you won’t be able to
use dynamic dungeons. Such games instead focus on precious
encounter design, in which enemies and terrain are carefully
designed in static, prefabricated packages to create maximum
tactical interest. The better tactical RPGs will give you
guidelines on how best to do that for their specific mechanics.

1ST–LEVEL FRAGILITY
When running dynamic dungeons in D&D, something to be
particularly conscious of is the fragility of 1st-level characters.
Their limited resources combined with the high probability of
any single hit reducing them to 0 HP (or even killing them
outright) makes them particularly vulnerable to the large
groups of opponents that are usually desirable in action groups.

For a 1st-level adventure, I recommend using only Easy action
groups with one or two opponents. Alternatively, simply limit
your scenarios to static dungeons until the PCs level up.

DUNGEON FACTIONS

Many dungeons will be the demesne of a single faction:
The caves where the Skullface goblins live

The grotto fortress of the drow
The mansion belonging to the Donatello crime family
The hive filled with giant bees
The sunken reef villa of the sahuagin lord

Such dungeons are referred to as lairs. You might run into the
occasional prisoner, dissatisfied minion, or competing party of
adventurers within such dungeons, but for the most part everyone
you meet in a lair is working for the same “team.”
Other dungeons, however, aren’t so simple. Within their vaulted
halls, there are multiple factions at work. It’s possible that they’re
working together in a temporary alliance or living with some rickety
détente, but it’s also possible that they’re actively hostile with each
other—Montagues and Capulets, drow and svirfneblin, liches and
beholders, Eloi and Morlocks.
Adding faction means adding action. A lair will usually settle
down into some form of status quo, its denizens going through their
normal routines. Just living their lives. But once you add multiple
factions—once you add giant wasps to the giant beehive—the
conflict and competing interests between those factions will drive
events forward.
Having multiple factions also means opportunity. They give the
PCs a chance to sow division, forge alliances, seek refuge, play both
ends against the middle, and otherwise take advantage of the more

complex strategic tapestry afforded by the fault lines between
factions.
As play continues, the PCs’ actions will disrupt whatever balance
of power previously existed in the dungeon. Between sessions, as
you’re doing your restocking checks and updating your dungeon
key, the factions become a framework for figuring out what happens
next.
“Okay, the PCs killed seventy percent of the orc population on
Level 3. Who can take advantage of that, and what will the Orc
King’s response be? Actually, wait, they just killed the Orc King.
Have the orcs broken up into factions? Could the Red Prince”—I just
made that name up, potentially personalizing one of the nameless
orcs on the adversary roster—“have allied with the goblins on Level
2 to push his claims? How will the other orcs feel about being asked
to coexist with lowly goblins? Will they turn to the Voodoo
Necromancer of the Southern Hills”—a character I just made up out
of whole cloth—“who was once the Orc King’s adviser?”
That’s 15 seconds of brainstorming. Follow it up with a few
minutes of actual prep and you’ve got orc-and-goblin warbands with
faces painted bright crimson squaring off against orc warriors
’roided out on alchemical strength boosters wearing the bone
fetishes of the Voodoo Necromancer. It doesn’t even really matter if
the PCs don’t get directly involved in the actual politics here: Even
if they just slash their way through these orcish factions, they’ll
recognize that the dungeon has changed in their absence and get
some unique and interesting hacking out of it.
CREATING FACTIONS
For each faction in the dungeon, you’ll want to prep the
faction roster,

faction territory,
faction agenda, and
faction reaction.

The faction roster is simply part of the dungeon’s adversary
roster, identifying the dungeon denizens who belong to or are
closely allied with the faction. You may find it convenient to prep a
separate roster for each faction, or, depending on the dungeon, you
may find it better to indicate each action group’s faction alliance in
the notes column of a single adversary roster.
The faction territory is simply whatever section of the dungeon
the faction controls. I often find it useful to color-code each faction,
and then outline each territory in the matching color. In some cases,
I find it can be clearer to make a copy of the dungeon map and
literally color in each faction’s territory.
Not every section of a dungeon needs to belong to one of the
factions. In fact, having no-man’s-lands between the factions can be
quite effective. It gives space for nonaligned denizens to lurk, for the
PCs to find sanctuary, and/or for the factions to fight each other.
Giving each faction a faction agenda—something they
specifically want or want to achieve—will provide a motivation for
their actions, and thereby help inspire you in figuring out what
those actions should be.
The faction reaction is how they will likely respond to the PCs.
Remember reaction checks? This is the same thing: Immediate
Attack, Hostile, Cautious/Threatening, Neutral, or Amiable. By
default, in fact, this will be determined by the random chance of the
reaction check the first time the PCs encounter members of the
faction. (First impressions are very important!) Alternatively, you
could preset each faction’s reaction as part of your prep. (The gricks
will attack on sight and the goblins are Hostile, but the kobolds are
Cautious and the dark dwarves are Neutral.) An option that splits
the difference is to give each faction a bias to their reaction check.
Of course, over time, the actions of the PCs may influence and
change the faction reaction to them.
RANDOM FACTION CONFLICT
With your factions in place, you may find it useful to use a
procedural content generator to develop the relationships between

factions over time. As always, your personal inspiration should take
precedence, but if you find yourself looking for a little inspiration,
you can follow this procedure between sessions.
You’ll first need to construct a random faction table for your
dungeon. To do this, simply list the factions in your dungeon and
assign an appropriate die. There are three additional entries that can
be fun to add to this table:
Wandering Adventurers, representing any competing
adventuring groups that might also be exploring the dungeon.
Outsiders, providing a prompt that some faction outside of the
dungeon has become interested in its affairs. (This could be a
completely new faction, in which case you’d obviously need to
create it. Alternatively, it might be some other faction that’s been
established in a previous adventure, binding the campaign
together.)

Roll Again Twice, creating the possibility of multi-party faction
conflicts.
With your random faction table in hand, use the following
procedure:
1. Make a faction conflict check by rolling 1d6. A roll of 1
indicates that conflict has broken out between the factions.
2. Determine the factions involved by rolling twice on your random
faction table. (If you roll the same number twice, either reroll or
assume some sort of civil strife.)
3. Roll on the faction conflict table on the next page to determine
the outcome of the conflict.
Finally, interpret this result and translate it into the appropriate
updates to your adversary roster and key.

Stalemate Skirmish: The factions are largely unaffected by
the conflict. Their defensive positions may have been reinforced,
or you may wish to subtract one or two members from one of
their encounters or action groups. (The conflict may leave them
ripe for alliances against their recent foes, or leave a chamber
showing recent signs of conflict, or a couple of new graves have
been dug in the cemetery at the entrance of the dungeon.)
Faction Damaged: A damaged faction has suffered losses equal to
roughly 25 percent of their strength. (You might eliminate entire
encounters or action groups, or perhaps subtract 1d4 members
from each encounter or action group for that faction.)
Faction Crippled: A crippled faction has suffered losses equal to
roughly 50 percent of their strength. (This makes it very likely
that entire action groups have been lost. Consider also modifying
their territory, or leaving chunks of it undefended.)

Faction Destroyed: A destroyed faction has been eliminated.
Their lair may lie empty, be occupied by the other faction
involved in the conflict, or restocked randomly. Their population
has been killed, driven off, or enslaved.
Factions Unite: The two factions have allied with each other.
(One of their leaders may have been killed or subjugated, uniting
the factions under a single leader. Or the alliance may be for
some short-term goal. Or the populations might be fully
intermixed between their lairs.)

EXAMPLE: FACTION CONFLICT

Like a random encounter check, the output of random faction
conflict is designed to be flexibly and creatively interpreted. Let’s
take a look at what it might look like in practice if you rolled a
successful faction conflict check.
Determine Factions: I roll 1d12 twice, generating 6 and 8. That’s
the Asmodean Hobgoblins and the Court of Waves.
Determine Outcome: I roll 1d8 and get 5. That’s Both Factions
Damaged.
Interpret Results: I know that the hobgoblins have been in
conflict with the sahuagin lakefolk. The sahuagin have been able
to use their water magic to ward against the hobgoblin fire magic
and hell hounds. So there are a couple possibilities here: I could
imagine the sahuagin going to the Court of Waves and making
pledges of fealty to the feyish powers in exchange for their
assistance against the hobgoblins. Or, alternatively, the
hobgoblins could be the supplicants to the Court, asking them to
use their powerful elemental magic to create a destructive tidal
wave in the sahuagin’s underground lakes that would ruin their
defenses.
The latter seems more intriguing to me. (You could easily decide
otherwise or come up with some other explanation entirely.) But
how did this result in the hobgoblins and the Court of Waves ending
up damaged? Hmm … What if the ritual went horribly awry,
unleashing uncontrolled elementals who ran rampant through the
Courts and slew the hobgoblin leaders who were in attendance for
the ritual?
Now you’ve got a leadership crisis on Level 5, blasted chaos on
Level 7, and rampaging elementals added to the random encounter
tables throughout the entire dungeon.
See how easy this is? Let’s do it again.
Determine Factions: I roll 10 and 6. That’s Wandering
Adventurers and the Asmodean Hobgoblins again.

Determine Outcome: I roll 7 for Both Factions Destroyed.
Interpret Results: This one is pretty easy to figure out. A group
of adventurers (or perhaps mercenaries hired by the sahuagin?)
invaded Level 5 and wiped out the still highly disorganized
hobgoblin cultists. Ironically, the surviving adventurers were then
killed by one of the rampaging elementals.
Let’s go one step further here and suggest that sahuagin wavecasters have descended into the now-abandoned hobgoblin warrens
and are trying to pacify the rogue elemental.
I think you can see how this simple system can be used to add a
little quick spice to a large dungeon or megadungeon between PC
visitations.

NOW YOU ARE
THE MASTER!
You’ve learned a lot! And, if all’s gone well, you’ve run your first
adventure. Ideally, you’ve run several of them. You’re starting to get
comfortable as a DM, and you’ve started experimenting with larger,
more complicated, and more dynamic scenarios.
What’s next?
That’s up to you!
The location crawls you’ve been running so far are an incredibly
versatile scenario structure, and you’ll find them cropping up in
almost every adventure you ever run. (It turns out no matter where

you go … there’s a location.) But it probably won’t surprise you to
learn that they’re not the only scenario structure. There are many
other types of adventures to be had!
The rest of this book is an instruction manual for several different
scenario structures you can use to prep and run these adventures:
Mysteries (see here)

Raids and Heists (see here)
Urban Adventures (see here), including urbancrawls, social
events, and conspiracies
Wilderness Adventures (see here), including hexcrawls and
pointcrawls
You’ll likely recognize many of these concepts from the movies,
books, graphic novels, and other media you enjoy. If there’s one that
looks particularly exciting or enticing to you, you can skip straight
to that section.
Alternatively, you might want to check out the Extra Credit
section at the back of the book. These specialized tools and
techniques can be added to your game at any time, and will often
enhance many different scenario structures. So you should feel free
to reach out and grab anything that looks useful whenever the fancy
strikes you:
Creating Your Campaign (see here), including how you can find
players, pitch your game, create characters, and learn new
roleplaying games.
Campaign Status Documents (see here), a tool for organizing
your campaign notes.
The Open Table (see here), an alternative way of running a
campaign that can make playing an RPG as easy as a board game.
Quick-and-Dirty Worldbuilding (see here), with guidance for
the essential material you need to start running games in a world
of your own creation.

Running Combat (see here), a grab bag of tips and tricks for
improving your combat encounters.

Scenario Hooks (see here), aka how you get the players to play
your adventures.

Supporting Cast (see here), another grab bag of tools and tricks
for creating and running memorable NPCs.

Splitting the Party (see here), or what to do when the PCs want
to do multiple things at the same time.
Of course, you can also just keep reading the book from cover to
cover by simply turning the page! That’ll work just fine and nobody
is going to stop you.
Whichever path you choose, remember the most important lesson:
Have fun!

ROLEPLAYING GAMES WERE born in the dungeon, but they
didn’t stay there for long. In 1981, Chaosium, Inc., published Call of
Cthulhu, an RPG based on the horror fiction of H. P. Lovecraft in
which the players took on the roles of investigators seeking to
unravel eldritch mysteries.
Call of Cthulhu wasn’t the first time someone had run a mystery
scenario in an RPG, but it was the first time an RPG had been made
in which mysteries were the primary focus. The hobby has never
looked back, and you can find mystery scenarios almost everywhere
you look.
This is likely because mysteries are an incredibly versatile
scenario structure. Your mind might immediately leap to Agatha
Christie whodunnits, the flair of Holmesian deductions, or the antics
of private detectives in film noir, but as the example of Call of
Cthulhu demonstrates, that’s really only scratching the surface.
You’ve got police procedurals ranging from the lurid sensationalism
of the CSI franchise to the gritty realism of The Wire, but you’ve also
got newspaper dramas like All the President’s Men or Spotlight,
political thrillers, spy stories, legal thrillers, and conspiracy fiction,
to name just a few. Mysteries creep in around the edges of epic
fantasy (“What exactly is this magic ring the halfling found?”) and
superhero comics (Batman is the world’s greatest detective), and
they’re the basis for any number of pulp adventure stories: Who’s
rustling the cattle? Where is the Spear of Destiny? Why did this
strange island suddenly appear in the middle of the Pacific Ocean?
What happened to Will Byers?
Mystery scenarios, of course, work differently from dungeon
scenarios. Where the dungeon is made up of rooms connected by
corridors, the mystery is made up of scenes (or nodes) connected by
clues. To unlock the power of the mystery scenario for our
campaigns, we’ll first have to understand how these new tools work
at the table and in our prep.

SCENES
One of the things that makes a dungeon easy to run is that, in the
dungeon, every moment of the experience is usually (a) relevant, (b)
interesting, and therefore (c) part of the game.
If you try to do the same thing outside of the dungeon, though,
it’s usually a car wreck.
GM: Okay, what are you doing now?
PLAYER: Let’s head over to the Courvier Estate in the Nobles’
District. I want to see what Lady Isabella has to say about this.
GM: How are you getting there?
PLAYER: We’ll ride our horses.

GM: Okay, you get your horses out of the stables and begin riding
up Moonlight Lane. You reach the T-intersection with
Guildsman Road. Do you want to go right or left?
PLAYER: Left.
GM: Okay, you go another block down to Almond Street. Which
way do you want to go?
PLAYER: Straight.

That’s obviously not right, is it?
You could similarly imagine trying to navigate through a forest by
describing every tree or trying to stake out a tavern to see if Lord
Arundel will show up in disguise only to have the GM describe
every single person who walks in or out of the tavern for six hours.
What this should probably look like instead is something like this:
PLAYER: Let’s head over to the Courvier Estate in the Nobles’
District. I want to see what Lady Isabella has to say about this.

GM: Okay, when you arrive at the Courvier Estate, you are
ushered into Lady Isabella’s private study. A few moments later,
she comes sweeping into the room. “What do you want? I’m
very busy.”
Or, alternatively:
PLAYER: Let’s head over to the Courvier Estate in the Nobles’
District. I want to see what Lady Isabella has to say about this.
GM: (rolls some dice) As you’re heading up Guildsman Road toward
the Nobles’ District, an arrow suddenly flies past Natasha’s head
before skipping off the cobblestones. Her horse whinnies in
alarm. Give me initiative checks!
In both cases we’ve skipped over the boring bits and jumped
ahead to the next interesting bit.

EMPTY TIME

We refer to the boring bits as empty time. The stuff that happens
during empty time isn’t necessarily irrelevant or unimportant, it’s
just that the characters aren’t making meaningful choices during
that time. The choices that the PCs are making during empty time
either won’t change the outcome, they’re not choices that we, as
players, are interested in, or both.
For example, a badly injured character might need to undergo
weeks of physical therapy at Lincoln Memorial to recover or a group
of galactic diplomats might need to travel for days through
hyperspace to reach the capital of the Seven Star Imperium. These
are not unimportant tasks—the injured character must do the
therapy to recover and the diplomats may be rushing to prevent an
interstellar war—but unless we’re interested in roleplaying specific
moments in the struggle of therapy or exploring inter-character
drama in the quiet moments on board the starlight courier (and we
very well could be!), the ultimate outcome of recovery or arrival at
the foreign capital is a foregone conclusion and the intervening span
is empty time.

The interesting bits, on the other hand—the fight that crippled the
character, the negotiations with the Seven Star Imperium—are
scenes. They float like islands in the sea of empty time, and they’re
connected by intention.
In fact, I find it easiest to identify empty time—the bit we skip
over—by looking at the players’ current intention. What is it that
they want to do? The intention creates a vector. All you need to do
is look along that vector and ask yourself, “Where’s the next
meaningful choice?”
For example, the PCs’ intention is to go to the Courvier Estate.
Is the choice of route significant?
Maybe it is! Maybe that ambush only happens if the PCs go up
Guildsman Road. If they take the scenic route along Old Dragon
Gorge Road instead, they’d avoid the ambush and arrive at the
Courvier Estate without incident. (Or maybe with a different
incident.)
But more likely the choice of route isn’t significant. Almond
Street? Walnut Street? Macadamia Way? It doesn’t matter. It’s not a
meaningful choice, so we can skip past it and continue following the
vector until we find a choice that is meaningful.
Broadly speaking, if the PCs declare an intention, they’ll either
achieve that intention (e.g., they reach the Courvier Estate and
speak with Lady Isabella) or they’ll encounter an obstacle. Following
the vector, we could imagine it being interrupted in any number of
ways:
They get ambushed on the way.
The bridge over Dragon Gorge has been washed out and they’ll
need to take a different route (or help repair the bridge).

The Nobles’ District has been quarantined due to an outbreak of
arcano-plague.
The doorman at the Courvier Estate refuses them entry.

Lady Isabella is not home at the moment because she’s attending
a meeting of the Lords’ Council to discuss the recent outbreak of
war in the Lowlands.
Spotting interruptions like these in a vector may be based on what
you know about the world and its current situation. (For example,
you know that insectoid assassins have been hunting the PCs. Or
your notes indicate that the Dragon Gorge bridge was washed out
during the flooding caused by the recent siege of the Aquanautic
Titans. Or it’s just logical that the PCs would be challenged by a
noble’s doorman.) But it can just as easily be a moment of creative
inspiration as you hear the players declare their intention and
immediately think, “Wouldn’t it be cool if they got ambushed by an
insectoid hit squad?” or “I think it would be fun to roleplay a scene
with that ornery Courvier doorman.” You might even have a
random encounter check or similar mechanic that would
systemically inject interruptions.
More often than not, though, you’ll find that vectors take you all
the way to their destination without interruption: If the PCs want to
do research at the library, they’ll arrive at the library. If they want
to meet with an NPC, they’ll find the NPC. If they want to go back
to the dungeon, they’ll get there and start delving.
CONTEXT IS MEANINGFUL
Something that can be easy to forget is that a choice can be
meaningful even if it only changes the context of an outcome.
For example, maybe the PCs are going to get ambushed by
insectoids no matter what route they choose to the Courvier Estate.
(Because an insectoid scout is lurking outside of their inn and will
summon the assassin swarm when they see the PCs leave.) But this
can actually make the choice of route meaningful, because an
ambush on Guildsman Street would be framed differently than one
along Old Dragon Gorge Road!

Deciding when context is or isn’t sufficiently meaningful is, of
course, more art than science.

TRANSITIONS

Having identified the empty time and, therefore, what the next
scene will be, how do we actually transition from the current scene
to the new one? What does “skipping the empty time” actually look
like?
The first option is a sharp cut. You simply jump directly from the
current scene to the beginning of the next scene.
PLAYER: Let’s head over to the Courvier Estate in the Nobles’
District. I want to see what Lady Isabella has to say about this.
GM: Okay, we cut to all of you waiting in Lady Isabella’s private
study. The door slams open and she comes sweeping into the
room. “What do you want? I’m very busy.”

This uses the language of film, and you may even find it useful to
literally say things like, “We cut to …” But you’ll see the same
technique in every storytelling medium, from novels to comic books.
The current scene is done; let’s move directly to where the next
interesting bit is.
A softer option is abstract time. It generally takes the form of an
eliding narration. Stuff like, “Several days pass as you cross the
Great Plain …” or “You leave the Docks and head across town …”
PLAYER: Let’s head over to the Courvier Estate in the Nobles’
District. I want to see what Lady Isabella has to say about this.

GM: Okay, you leave the Hogshead Tavern and head up Guildsman
Street into the Nobles’ District. After a brief and somewhat
rancorous exchange with the doorman at the Courvier Estate,
you’re ushered into Lady Isabella’s private study. A few

moments later, she comes sweeping into the room. “What do
you want? I’m very busy.”
I frequently default to this style because it never fully disengages
from the players. With practice it becomes easy to read a table’s
reaction to eliding narration and “know” when you need to drop out
of it and back into a scene. In other cases, the players will just speak
up and tell you. (For example, maybe the players would actually
like to ask the doorman a few questions while he’s escorting them to
the study.)
The advantage of sharp cuts, on the other hand, is a punchier
pacing and the ability to put really strong frames on the scenes you
choose. (More on that in a moment.)
A blended approach is also possible, featuring a sharp cut to a
point much closer to the new scene and then using eliding narration
to set the scene up.

This blended approach can give you some flexibility in setting up
the given circumstances of the scene—i.e., the stuff the players need
to know in order for the scene to make sense—and also gives the
players an opportunity to course correct how their characters would
enter the scene. (“Wait! I don’t want to knock on the door. I want to
sneak in and surprise Lady Isabella!”)

FRAMING THE SCENE

There are a bunch of different ways you can think about setting up
or “framing” a scene, but it largely boils down to rapidly
establishing the initial moment of the scene (the who, what, where,

and when) and then giving things a short, sharp push to put things
in motion.
Start by identifying the agenda of the scene. This is essentially
why you chose this scene. What was the meaningful choice you
identified? Why is it important? Why do we care? Agendas don’t
have to be incredibly clever or of earth-shattering significance, but
there has to be some sort of reason for why we’re playing out the
events of this scene.
Consider what a scene without an agenda looks like:
PLAYER: Let’s head over to the Courvier Estate in the Nobles’
District. I want to see what Lady Isabella has to say about this.
GM: Okay, we cut to: Guildsman Street. You’re riding your horses
toward the Nobles’ District and you’re approaching Walnut
Street. What are you going to do?
PLAYER: Ride straight through the intersection.

End of scene.
Without an agenda—without a reason to focus on the events at
the intersection of Guildsman and Walnut—that’s clearly a waste of
time.
You can think of an agenda either in terms of the scene’s stakes
(literally what’s at stake in the scene) or as a question that the
scene is going to answer.
For example, imagine that the PCs are about to encounter an ogre.
The agenda might be:
Can the PCs kill the ogre? (At stake are the lives of the PCs and
the life of the ogre.)

How are the PCs going to get past the ogre? (This makes the scene
more open-ended. It might still be resolved through combat, but
that’s not the only possibility.)
Can the ogre convince the PCs to help him fight the goblins? (This
is a completely different scene!)

Other agendas might include:
Can Antoine stop the angry mob from burning down the
necromancer’s tower?
Can Hammett find the bloodstained glove?

Will LaPadite betray the Jewish family living in his secret attic?
Will Annie take the heroin?

How much of Case’s sanity will be lost gazing through the portal?
These are not, it should be noted, questions that you need to
know the answer to. Quite the opposite, in fact. You’re playing the
scene to find the answer, and you can only find it in collaboration
with your players. By creating the scene together and seeing what
happens.
As you play the scene, in fact, you may discover that it’s actually
about a completely different question than you thought. (You
framed the scene as, “Can the PCs kill the ogre?” but then the bard
starts seducing the ogre.) That’s okay. More than okay, in fact.
Those often end up being the very best scenes.

RUNNING AWESOME SCENES
The trick to running an awesome scene is making sure that the
agenda of the scene can’t be trivially resolved.
Think about a combat scene. Most RPGs feature a big, robust
combat system, and so a combat scene is rarely trivial to

resolve: The players have to make lots of meaningful tactical
choices and figure out how to maneuver their way to victory.
Once you start framing non-combat scenes, however, they can
easily end up being short and unsatisfying: The PCs have an
objective. They briefly interact with the environment or an
NPC. And then the scene is abruptly done.
What the scene needs is an obstacle that will block the PCs
from achieving their objective. (A combat scene, you’ll note,
inherently provides this obstacle: the bad guys you need to
defeat.) You’ll get even better results if there are multiple
objectives, multiple obstacles, or both. If there are multiple
objectives, you can get a lot of mileage by setting up the scene
so that they conflict with each other (and, therefore, also
become the obstacles of the scene).
In framing scenes, we talked about identifying the vector of an
intention and looking at the point where that vector intersected
an obstacle. You can (and should!) continue that into the scene
itself: The PCs can’t just jump directly to an “I solve the
problem” die roll. Instead, they’ll need to take some
preparatory actions to establish an unobstructed vector to the
thing they want.
Example 1: You want to shoot Victor at his club. But you can’t
just drive up outside the club and shoot him. You’ll have to
start by finding a way to get inside (sneaking or fast-talking
your way past the bouncers or casting a teleport spell), then
track him down, and then take your shot.
Example 2: You want to convince Michael to sell you the data
chip. But first you need to get him to admit that he has it. Then
you’ve got to convince him that there’s another way to save his
sister. And then you’ve got to convince him that you’re offering
him something worth the risk.

The great thing is that you don’t even need to know how these
obstacles will be overcome. Instead, just set up the obstacles:
Michael doesn’t want to admit he has the data chip.
Michael needs it to save his sister.

Michael has hidden the data chip in a locker at the bus
station.
It’s up to the players to figure out the solutions!
(Not every scene needs to be awesome, though! Don’t push it.
Sometimes you really do want to just get in, answer a quick
question, and get out.)
THE BANG
Now that you know what the scene is about, you need the bang—
the explosive moment that forces the PCs to start making
meaningful choices (or at least provokes them with the opportunity
to do so), propelling the scene into motion. In that explosion, a bang
defines the agenda of the scene and reveals it to the players.
This is the arrow in the wall or the noblewoman barging through
the door and demanding answers. It’s the torches of the mob coming
over the hill or the Nazi knocking on your door.
The design of your bang will usually have a big impact on how
the scene plays out. For example, consider a scene where the PCs
encounter an ogre. Does the scene start when the ogre jumps out
and snarls in their face? Or when they’re still approaching its
chamber and they can hear the crunching of bones? Or when they
see a goblin strung up on a rack with its intestines hanging around
its ankles … and then the deep thudding of heavy footsteps fills the
corridor behind them as the ogre returns for its meal?
Other bangs might look like this:
You return home, but your wife isn’t there. As you enter your
bedchambers, you see a large bloodstain on the ground.

You’re riding through the Blue Hills when the sun sets and the full
moon begins to rise. In the distance, you hear the howl of wolves.
The howls are getting closer.
You rip open the envelope. There is only a single sheet of
parchment within, and there are no words on it. Only a single,
large, black spot.

Choosing the “right” bang is often more art than science, but a
rule of thumb I’ve found useful is the quicker you get to the bang
and the larger the number of interesting choices that can be made in
response to the bang, the better the bang is.
With that being said, while bangs launch scenes, that doesn’t
always mean that they’re the first thing that happens in a scene. It’s
often useful to give yourself a little breathing room to establish the
scene before kicking things into high gear. Consider the letter with
the black spot, for example. You could cut from some previous scene
directly to the PC ripping open a letter they received, but it might
be more effective if you took a step back and, for example,
described the messenger arriving to hand the letter to the PC (or the
PCs finding the letter lying on their bed or slipped into their pocket
or whatever the delivery mechanism might be) and then letting the
player announce that they’re opening the letter.
In fact, bangs can often land better if you’ve properly set the
scene. If the players are confused or trying to get their bearings in
the new scene, they may not be able to understand the full
importance—and, therefore, the full impact—of the bang.

SETTING THE SCENE: LOCATION &
CHARACTER

Now that you’ve framed the scene, you need to fill the frame with
all the specific details that will bring that scene to life. My
philosophy is to take all the elements of the scene—the who, what,
where, and when—and fill those elements with all sorts of toys that
both you and the PCs can play with. Once again, the more flexible

these toys are, the more useful they become and the more potential
the scene will have. If you include something that only has one
potential use, that’s good. But an element that can be used in eight
different ways? That’s S-tier.
The good news is that you don’t need to make eight different
plans for how to use an element. In fact, you almost certainly
shouldn’t. The priority is just including stuff that’s fun to play with.
Even better, your players are a gaggle of creativity, and if you let
them, they’ll take even the most boring stuff and spin it in ways you
could scarcely imagine. So as you’re filling the frame, remember this
all-important maxim:
You may know where the scene begins, but you don’t know where it
ends.
You’re not writing a book or filming a movie. Unlike a traditional
author, you may know where you’re starting, but you’ve got no idea
where the journey will end. That can sound intimidating, but in
practice it’s liberating. You just need to set the pins up. Your players
will be the ones to knock them down.
As you’re setting things up, the location is the When and Where
of the scene. It’s the immediate environment for the actions of the
scene and it can range from the claustrophobic (“the back room at
the Red Hand”) to the absurdly panoramic (“racing down the dusty
slopes of Olympus Mons”).
We talked about how to describe a room in Keying: Dungeon
Rooms (see here) and the truth is that a dungeon room is often just
a hyper-specific type of scene, so pretty much all of that advice also
applies when you’re describing other scenes:
Three of Five

Two Cool Details
Three-by-Three

And just like a dungeon room, you want to keep all of this as
pithy as possible.

The other major elements in the scene are the characters, the
Who of the scene. I find it useful to think about the characters in a
scene in three categories: leads, features, and extras.
Leads are the major characters in the scene. They’re the
characters who are most affected by the agenda of the scene or who
are capable of having the greatest impact on the agenda of the
scene.
Features are the supporting cast of the scene. They wield
influence over the leads or provide crucial information or are
important resources in whatever conflict is being fought.
Extras are scene-dressing. They might be taken hostage or
appealed to for mob justice, but they can usually just be thought of
as part of the location instead of as active agents in the scene.
PCs in a scene are almost always leads. You may find it useful to
think of some PCs as being the leads in the scene and other PCs as
features (because the agenda of the scene is primarily of interest to
the former and of less interest to the latter), but if you’ve got a
scene where none of the PCs are leads, you might want to take a
moment and triple-check what you’re doing. Unless you’ve got some
amazingly good reason for sidelining the PCs, it’s almost always a
good idea to find a way to reframe the agenda of the scene so that
it’s about the PCs.
The only situation in which I would consider framing a scene in
which the PCs aren’t leads is one in which the PCs are deliberately
choosing to not participate. For example, maybe they’re
eavesdropping on a conversation. (But even then, I’d double-check
to make sure that a secondary agenda in the scene isn’t about the
PCs avoiding detection. And then triple-check to make sure that the
scene isn’t really about something like “Will the PCs stop Roberta
from confessing her love to Charles?”)
GIVEN CIRCUMSTANCES
The given circumstances of a scene include all the elements of
the scene itself, but also all of the relevant events and continuity

that have led up to the scene. Confronting the villain who killed
your beloved horse or fighting a climactic battle in a burning house
when your own parents were killed in a fire packs an extra punch.

ENDING THE SCENE

We leave a scene the same way we entered it: by cutting to a new
scene.
The trick, of course, is knowing when you should cut away. The
facile answer is that the scene is over when the characters are done
making meaningful choices (and you, therefore, establish the vector
to the next meaningful choice and frame the next scene), but let’s
take a closer look at what that means in practice.
FINISHING THE AGENDA
If the agenda of a scene is defined by a question, a really obvious
place to cut from is the point where that question has been
answered.
This line of thinking, though, can become a trap if you think that
it’s the only way for a scene to end, largely because it will also mean
that you’ll feel pressured to conclusively resolve the agenda in every
scene. Some of the most interesting agendas actually develop over
multiple scenes before being resolved. (Think about will-they-won’tthey romances, for example.) Other conflicts literally can’t be
resolved until some other event has occurred. Staying mired in a
scene that has reached an impasse is a quick exercise in boredom,
and you’ll want to identify other moments that indicate when it’s
time to move on.
THE SECOND LULL
As you roleplay through scenes, you’ll start to get a feel for how
they flow—the back-and-forth between characters; the rise and fall
of tension. As a scene kicks off, things will often move fast and hard,
as all of the leads push hard on achieving their objectives. And then
there’ll often come a moment when things slow down, when people

seem uncertain in their actions, when things seem to be coasting a
little bit. That’s okay. Don’t cut away! The characters in the scene—
and the players around the table—need that moment to reflect on
what’s happened, think about what it means to them, and then
figure out how they’re going to adjust their strategy.
But what you generally want to avoid is the second lull. As things
start to slow down again, either cut away or introduce a new bang
to bring a new scene to them.
ON THE EXIT
If all the PCs leave, that’s a pretty clear-cut signal that the scene is
over. But often even a single lead leaving (whether that’s a PC or
NPC) will indicate that the scene is drawing to a close.
Much like the second lull, a good rule of thumb here can be the
second exit: The exit of the first lead makes it clear the scene is
coming to an end, giving everyone else a chance to wrap things up.
When the second lead leaves, it means that either the agenda has
been resolved or interest in the scene is waning fast and it’s time to
cut away.

SCENE TO SCENE

As one scene ends, it’s time for a new scene to begin. All
conversations are loops and it’s time to close this one: Identify the
next scene, then shift to abstract time or cut hard to the next bang.

THE THREE CLUE
RULE

We can now take our scenes and turn them into a mystery scenario.
The key building block of a mystery is the investigation scene, in
which the PCs discover a clue that points them in the direction of
another scene in which they can continue their investigation. The
clue, in other words, creates the vector between the current scene
and the next scene. (For example, the letters found partially burned
in the fireplace reveal that Claudette was exchanging regular
correspondence with Lord Denton. The next scene, therefore, can be
the PCs meeting with Lord Denton to ask him a few questions.)
The most basic structure for a mystery scenario is the
breadcrumb trail: Scene A has a clue pointing to Scene B; Scene B
has a clue pointing to Scene C; and so forth, until the penultimate
scene contains a clue pointing to the final scene of the adventure,
where the truth is discovered, the bad guy is confronted, or both.
For example, if Claudette was slain by a vampire, then the final
clue might reveal the location of the vampire’s crypt. If she faked
her own death in order to escape with the Summerville Diamond,
then the final clue could point to the hunting lodge where both she
and the jewel are hidden away.
The breadcrumb trail, however, has a fatal flaw. In order for the
scenario to work, each clue must lead to the next, and that means
there must be an unbroken chain of clues from the beginning of the
scenario until the end. If the PCs were to miss any of the clues, they
would become lost and the scenario would break.
Each clue becomes a chokepoint in the scenario, and each
chokepoint increases the fragility of the scenario. The more clues
your scenario has, the more fragile it becomes. In fact, it’s even
worse than that, because each clue is actually multiple chokepoints:
The PCs need to look for the clue.
The PCs need to find the clue.

The PCs need to interpret the clue and reach the correct
conclusion.

For example, consider Claudette’s burned letters. Although it
seems obvious to you that the PCs should search her room, they
might never think to do that or even deliberately choose not to do
it. (“We’ve troubled her mother enough.”) If they do search the
room, they might never look in the fireplace, or perhaps they fail
their Intelligence (Investigation) check to find the letters. Having
found the burned scraps of paper, they have to choose to read them
(which, again, seems obvious, but might not be to the players for
any number of reasons) and, having read them, they need to
correctly conclude that they should seek out the Lord Denton
mentioned in the letters.
Remember: If any one of these steps—searching the room, finding
the letters, reading the letters, realizing they should talk to Lord
Denton—fails to happen, the scenario would break and the PCs
would have no way of finishing it. Or even continuing. Your whole
session just slams into a wall.
And that’s just one clue!
This kind of tight, bare-bones, clue-to-clue-to-clue plotting can
work in noninteractive mediums because the writers control the
characters and can ensure they always reach the right conclusion at
the right time. In reality, though, it’s not even the way most
detective stories work. It can be slightly more common in TV
procedurals, likely due to the limitations of time, but the next time
you’re reading a mystery novel or watching a whodunnit film, pay
attention to how often a detective’s deduction will be based on not
one clue, but several.
For example, consider this exchange from A Study in Scarlet, the
first Sherlock Holmes mystery:
WATSON: “That seems simple enough, said I; but how about the
other man’s height?”

HOLMES: “Why, the height of a man, in nine cases out of ten, can
be told from the length of his stride. It is a simple calculation
enough, though there is no use my boring you with figures. I
had this fellow’s stride both on the clay outside and on the dust

within. Then I had a way of checking my calculation. When a
man writes on a wall, his instinct leads him to write above the
level of his own eyes. Now that writing was just over 6 feet
from the ground. It was child’s play.”
This is just one small deduction in a much larger mystery, but
Holmes has taken several pieces of information—the tracks outside,
the tracks inside, the writing on the wall—studied them, and then
drawn his conclusion from them. And just like the Great Detective
gathering a body of evidence until, ultimately, a conclusion
emerges, we can follow this trail of clues until it leads us inexorably
to the solution for transforming the fragility of our breadcrumb
mysteries into a robust scenario structure:
For any conclusion you want the PCs to make, include at least
three clues.
This is the Three Clue Rule.
Why three clues? Because the PCs will probably miss the first,
ignore the second, and misinterpret the third, before synthesizing all
of them in some incredible leap of logic that you never anticipated,
but somehow gets them exactly where they were supposed to go the
whole time.
(I’m only slightly joking.)
If you think of each clue as a plan (the PCs will find A, conclude
B, and go to C), then when you have three clues you not only have a
plan; you’ve also got two backup plans. It’s all about redundancy.
In a best-case scenario, the PCs will find all three clues. There’s
nothing wrong with this! The players can use the additional clues
they find to confirm and reinforce their conclusions. For the players,
this sort of positive feedback feels great. (“I knew there was
something fishy about Lord Denton!”) And it only serves to make
the scenario robust.
Even better, remember that one of our potential failure points
comes from the players finding a clue but then misinterpreting what
it means. For example, they find a coat check receipt signed by Lord

Denton, but become convinced that it means they should stake out
the coat check at the Hotel du Chat Noir. Additional clues can help
push the players off these erroneous conclusions and get them back
on track. (“The letters mention a Lord Denton. Wasn’t that also the
name on the coat check receipt?”)
In a worst-case scenario, of course, the PCs may completely miss
(or misinterpret) two of the clues, but they’ll still have at least one
clue in hand that will keep the mystery moving forward.
A corollary here is that there are NO exceptions to the Three Clue
Rule.
“But this clue is really obvious! There’s no way the players won’t
figure it out!”
In my experience, you’re probably wrong. The reality is that
you’re the one designing the scenario, which means that you already
know the solution. That makes it almost impossible for you to judge
whether or not the clue is “obvious.” It’s like answering a riddle that
you already know the answer to.
More importantly, even if you’re right and the solution is obvious
… so what? We already know that having extra clues to confirm and
reinforce this “obvious” solution isn’t going to cause any problems.
So why not be safe rather than sorry?
Now, if three clues are good, why not more? Why not five? Or
eight? Or twenty?
There’s nothing wrong with more clues, but in my experience,
three clues is the sweet spot. With three clues you have enough
redundancy that the PCs will almost never completely miss all the
clues they need, and they also provide enough complexity that the
players will be able to combine information, confirm their
hypotheses, and enjoy some positive reinforcement that makes the
whole mystery feel tight and satisfying.

LEADS VS. EVIDENCE

There are actually two types of clues in a mystery scenario.

First, there are leads that tell you where you can go to find more
clues. These are the procedural clues that will move the PCs from
one scene to the next.
Second, there’s evidence that will help you understand what’s
happening (e.g., who the murderer is).
For example, when the PCs find Claudette’s body they might find
identification papers that include her address. This is a lead that
points them toward searching her rooms (where they can find the
burnt letters, which are another lead pointing to Lord Denton).
RED HERRINGS ARE OVERRATED
Red herrings are a classic element of the mystery genre: All the
evidence points toward X, but it’s a red herring! The real
murderer is Y!
When it comes to designing an RPG scenario, though, I’ve
found that red herrings are overrated. I’m not going to go so far
as to say you should never use them, but I will go so far as to
say that you should only use them with extreme caution.
First, getting players to make the deductions they’re supposed
to make is hard enough. Throwing in a red herring (i.e., a clue
pointing to a false deduction) just makes that harder. Even
worse, once the players have reached a conclusion, they tend to
latch on to it. It can be extremely difficult to convince the
group to let it go and reassess the evidence.
The key way to make a red herring work in a mystery story,
after all, is have some piece of evidence that absolutely and
incontrovertibly refutes it. (“Harold couldn’t have murdered
Judy; he was at the bar when she was murdered!”)
Unfortunately, your concept of “incontrovertible refutation”
may hold just as much water as your concept of “really obvious
clue that cannot be missed.” (So if you do decide to include a

red herring, make sure to include at least three clues refuting
it!)
Second, there’s really no need for you to prep a red herring.
The players are almost certainly going to take care of it for you.
If you fill your adventure with nothing but clues pointing
conclusively and decisively at the real killer, I can virtually
guarantee you that the players will become suspicious of at
least three other people before they figure out who’s really
behind it all. They will, in fact, become very attached to these
suspicions and begin weaving complicated theories explaining
how the evidence they have fits the suspect they want. (This is
a classic example of how a clue can be misinterpreted, which is
why the Three Clue Rule is so important to begin with!)
But in investigating her body, the PCs might also discover that it’s
been drained of blood. That’s evidence pointing toward the
conclusion that a vampire is responsible for her death. (Similarly, in
the burnt letters, Claudette might mention seeing an unusually large
bat in the tree outside her window at night, the malevolent red glare
of its eyes seeming to burn their way into her soul.)
Both evidence and leads should follow the Three Clue Rule, but
they can do so in slightly different ways.
In order to get out of one scene and into the next, the players
need to have enough leads pointing them to another scene where
they can look for more clues. That generally means that every scene
is going to need to have three leads in it.
The evidence that points to the solution of the mystery, on the
other hand, can be spread out across multiple scenes. There might
even be entire scenes, particularly early in the adventure, that
include no such clues! In such scenarios, the players would need to
follow several leads in order to get deep enough into the mystery to
start uncovering the truth.

PERMISSIVE CLUE-FINDING

The maxim “more clues are always better” is an important one.
There can be a natural impulse when designing a mystery to hold
back information. After all, a mystery is essentially defined by a lack
of information. The detective doesn’t know who the murderer is,
right?
As GMs, this can give us a subconscious bias toward trying to hide
information from the players. If a clue wasn’t planned ahead of time
—if it wasn’t parsimoniously assigned to them in our notes—then
the PCs shouldn’t be allowed to have it! It would ruin the mystery!
But although we may be tempted to fixate on the enigma that
motivates the PCs, mysteries are actually defined by the acquisition
of knowledge, not its lack. So what we need to do is exactly the
opposite. As we run our mystery scenarios, we need to consciously
choose to be permissive in clue-finding.
Of course, there’s a difference between having lots of clues and
having the murderer write his home address in blood on the wall.
But whenever you hold back a piece of information, you’re closing
off a path toward potential success. So unless you have a good
reason to block it off, your first impulse should be to keep the path
open.
In other words, default to yes. If the players go looking for
information, default to the idea that they find something useful,
unless their method of investigation is completely unrelated. (Like,
say, staking out the coat check at a random hotel.)
Here’s another way of thinking about it: Don’t treat the list of
clues you came up with during your prep as a straitjacket. Instead,
think of that prep work as your safety net.
I used to get really attached to the particularly clever solutions I
designed. I would emotionally invest in the idea of my players
discovering this clever solution that I had created. As a result, I
would tend to veto other potential solutions the players came up
with—after all, if those other solutions worked they would never
discover MY clever solution!

Over time, I’ve learned that it’s actually a lot more fun when the
players surprise me. So now I try to think of my predesigned
solution as a worst-case scenario—the safety net that snaps into
place when my players fail to come up with anything more
interesting.
To be open to permissive clue-finding, however, you first have to
understand the underlying situation: Who is the vampire? How did
he kill this victim? Why did he kill them? When did he kill them?
Then embrace the unexpected ideas and approaches proposed by the
players and figure out how they can be used to point them toward
your revelations.

PROACTIVE CLUES

Sometimes, despite your best efforts, the players will work
themselves into a dead end: They don’t know what the clues mean
or they’re ignoring the clues or they’ve used the clues to reach an
incorrect conclusion and are now heading in completely the wrong
direction. (When I’m using the Three Clue Rule, I find this will most
often happen when the PCs don’t realize that there’s actually a
mystery that needs to be solved—not every mystery is as obvious as
a dead body, after all.)
This is when having a backup plan is useful. The problem in this
scenario is that the PCs are being too passive—either because they
don’t have the information they need or because they’re using the
information in the wrong way. The solution, therefore, is to have
something active happen to them.
Raymond Chandler’s advice for this kind of impasse was “Have a
guy with a gun walk through the door.”
Or, more generally: The bad guy finds out they’re being
investigated and they take some kind of action against the PCs
(sending someone to kill them or bribe them or dig up blackmail on
them or kidnap their loved ones, etc.).
Or, alternatively: The next part of the bad guy’s plan happens. For
example, they rob another bank. Or kill another victim. (This has

the effect of proactively creating a new location or event for the PCs
to interact with.)
The idea with all of these, of course, is not simply to have
something happen. What you’re really doing is giving the PCs a new
avenue for obtaining a clue that they need: That’s either a new
crime scene for them to investigate, or it’s a matchbook in the thug’s
pocket that will point them at the bar they need to investigate.
In a worst-case scenario, though, you can also design a final “Get
Out of Jail Free” card that you can use to bring the scenario to a
satisfactory close no matter how badly the PCs get bollixed up. For
example, in our vampire mystery—if the PCs get completely lost—
you could simply have the vampire show up and try to kill them
(because she thinks they’re “getting too close”). This is usually less
satisfactory than actually hunting the vampire down in her lair, but
at least it gets you out of a bad situation. It’s the final backup when
all other backups have failed.
LOGIC CLUES AREN’T CONCLUSIONS!
One common error that a lot of people make when using the
Three Clue Rule for the first time is to mistake it for a kind of
logic puzzle:
This clue indicates that the killer was wearing a green
sweater.

This clue indicates that the killer was taller than 6 feet.
This clue indicates that the killer had gray hair.

If you combine those together, you know that the only person
with gray hair who was taller than 6 feet who was also wearing
a green sweater was Peter, so Peter is the killer!
This can work if each of these clues points uniquely to Peter:
He was the only one wearing a green sweater, the only one
taller than 6 feet, and the only one with gray hair. (These are
then three different clues all pointing to the same conclusion.)

But if you need all three pieces of information to eliminate
other people with green sweaters or gray hair or whatever, then
these are actually three different conclusions and each one
needs three different clues pointing to it.

HOMEWORK
YOUR FIRST MYSTERY
The great thing about a mystery scenario is that, once you know
how they work, they’re super simple to put together. For your first
mystery scenario, we’re going to construct a basic mystery chain—a
series of scenes with each scene connected to the next by a set of
clues.

STEP 1: THE SCENARIO CONCEPT

Start by figuring out what the mystery is about. Was someone
murdered or kidnapped? Was something stolen or destroyed? Is
someone being threatened? Who did it? Why? Are there weird

phenomena? Where are they coming from? Are they dangerous and
need to be stopped, or benign and in need of protection?

STEP 2: THE HOOK

How do the PCs become aware that there’s a mystery to be solved?
If it’s a crime, there’ll usually be a crime scene. It can also just be
something like “the place where weird stuff is happening.” Or
maybe someone or something comes to the PCs and brings the
mystery with them. (Thugs kicking down the door is a classic, but so
is, “We just got attacked by something weird out on Route 6,” and
“My name is Miss Johnson and I’d like to hire you for a job.”)
The hook is your first scene.

STEP 3: THE ENDING

What’s the conclusion? Where do the PCs learn the ultimate answers
and/or get into a big fight with the bad guy? (Big fights with bad
guys are a really easy way to manufacture a satisfying conclusion.)
The ending, of course, is the last scene of the scenario.

STEP 4: INVESTIGATION SCENES

Brainstorm cool locations or people related to the mystery. Ex-wife
of the bad guy? Abandoned mansion on the mist-shrouded heath?
Stone circle that serves as a teleport gate? Follow your imagination
wherever it takes you.
A mystery chain can be extended to any length, but five scenes is
a good length for a scenario you want to play through in a single
session. Since you already have a hook and an ending, that means
you’re aiming for three more scenes, but I recommend
brainstorming more than three items and then picking the three
coolest ideas. You’ll end up with better stuff. (Also: Before you toss
the other ideas, see if there’s any way you can combine them with
the three you picked and make them even cooler.)

Scenes that consist only of the PCs talking to a single NPC are
likely to run a little shorter than other scenes. That’s just fine, but if
you have a lot of these scenes, you may want to add a few more to
make sure the players don’t speedrun your scenario. (If you need a
rule of thumb, assume a social-only scene is only worth a “half”
scene for the purposes of hitting your quota of five scenes.)

STEP 5: A PROACTIVE ELEMENT

Remember the guy with a gun? Add one of these proactive elements
to your adventure, giving yourself a scene that you can trigger at
any time if you need to get things back on track or, alternatively,
add a little extra content if the PCs are making short work of your
scenario.
As we’ve discussed, the two big options here are (a) the bad guy
figuring out the PCs are trouble and sending someone (or
something) to get them to lay off or (b) the next part of the bad
guy’s plan happens (and the PCs learn of it).
Either way, remember that the primary goal is for this proactive
scene to drop additional clues that the PCs can follow to hop back
onto the mystery chain, so make sure you figure out what those
leads look like. You might even want to prep multiple leads, using
whichever one is most appropriate for where the PCs are currently
located on the chain.
DUNGEONS IN YOUR MYSTERIES
Think about including a micro-dungeon (see here) as one of the
locations in your mystery chain. (In practice, this means you
might have multiple scenes at that one location, but that’s just
fine: You just plant your three clues in the various rooms of the
dungeon.)
This can include both your hook (the PCs explore a dungeon
and find clues leading into a mystery scenario) and your

conclusion (e.g., they have to fight their way through a crypt or
a penthouse or a container ship to confront the bad guy).
Particularly for your first mystery adventure, including one—or
two!—micro-dungeon(s) is a great way to give yourself some
rock-steady islands of familiarity as you chart your way
through unfamiliar waters.
You can also do this with other scenario structures, like raids
(see here) or heists (see here). For example, clues might inform
the PCs that they need to obtain the Jade Eagle of Chang’an,
but the only way they can do that is by stealing it from the
Guatemalan mansion of Luisa Fernanda Pérez Rodríguez.

STEP 6: CONNECT THEM WITH CLUES

Now that you have your list of five investigation scenes, you just
need to connect them. Figure out what order the scenes should be in
—based on either what’s logical or what’s most dramatic (or both)—
and then add three clues to each scene pointing to the next scene.
As you’re doing this, I recommend making a revelation list. To
get started, simply list each investigation scene the PCs need to find.
Each of these is a revelation (or conclusion) that the players need to
have while playing the scenario, so under each one you should list
the required three clues. For example:
SCENE 2: CLAUDETTE’S RESIDENCE
Claudette’s Identification Papers (Scene 1)
Canvass the Neighborhood (Scene 1)

Madame Rosette’s Identification of the Body (Scene 1)
SCENE 3: SPEAK TO LORD DENTON
Claudette’s Burnt Letters (Scene 2)

Lord Denton’s Coat Check Receipt (Scene 2)
Questioning the Staff (Scene 2)

STEP 7: ANCILLARY REVELATIONS

With the essential procedural revelations listed along with their
clues, you can now flesh out your revelation list with all of the
conclusions that are based on evidence. For example, in our
investigation of Claudette’s murder, we have the evidence pointing
to a vampire being responsible:
CLAUDETTE’S KILLER IS A VAMPIRE
Claudette’s body is drained of blood (Scene 1).

Burnt letters reference a bat haunting her (Scene 2).

Lord Denton mentions her irrational fear of bats (Scene 3).
Large wolf stalks PCs, turns to mist (Proactive Scene).

You’ll note that I’ve included more than three clues for this
revelation, which is, of course, just fine. I’ve also indicated in which
scene each clue can be found, which is useful because the clues for
these types of evidence-based discoveries can be spread across
multiple scenes.
It’s not that this sort of ancillary revelation isn’t actionable (the
PCs could, for example, stock up on stakes, mirrors, and garlic), but
rather that it won’t lead the PCs to a new scene where they can
continue their investigation.
This step is technically optional, since you can theoretically have
a purely procedural mystery in which the PCs follow leads from one
scene to the next until they reach the conclusion. In practice,
however, you’ll almost always find that there are other enigmas that
you want the players to unravel. In fact, it’s really recommended,
since it will add a lot of depth and interest to your players’
experience.

STEP 8: FLESH OUT YOUR SCENES

Finally, take a look at your list of investigation scenes and flesh
them out.
If it’s a simple location, you can use an approach similar to a
dungeon room: a description you can use when the players arrive at
the location, followed by important elements (including, for
example, the clues the PCs can find there).
More elaborate locations may have multiple rooms (e.g., both the
bar and the manager’s office in the back). Some locations might
even be full-fledged location crawls embedded in your mystery
scenario, but don’t fall into the trap of treating every location as if it
were a dungeon: If the PCs aren’t crawling from one room to the
next and exploring most rooms in detail, prepping that location as if
it were a dungeon will probably be a waste of your time.
For example, when the PCs arrive at the mansion where Claudette
lived, they’re likely to be greeted by her mother, Madame Rosette.
It’s not likely that they’ll meticulously search every room in the
mansion as if it were a dungeon, and if they did it wouldn’t be very
productive, since none of those rooms contain clues. (So even if the
players wanted to search the mansion from roof to basement, their
search would be empty time and you should frame past it, probably
by saying something like, “You spend the afternoon going over the
mansion with a fine-tooth comb but don’t find anything outside of
Claudette’s room. As you open the door to her room, you see …”)
So in this case you’d want notes that would let you introduce the
mansion and Madame Rosette, and then probably detailed notes on
Claudette’s room where the PCs will focus their investigation (or, at
the very least, where their investigation will bear fruit).
If your investigation scene is focused on an NPC, or if an NPC is of
particular importance within a larger scene, you’ll want to prep the
material you need to feel confident roleplaying them. We talk about
this in more detail in the Supporting Cast extra credit starting on
page 506. If the NPC has a clue the PCs need, make sure to note that
as key info so that you don’t forget to give it to them.

PREPPING SCENES VS. RUNNING SCENES
We’ve talked about framing scenes during play and we’ve
talked about prepping scenes for your scenario. These are not
precisely the same thing, although there’s a lot of overlap
between them.
Framing a scene involves setting the agenda, describing the
environment, introducing the characters, and throwing a bang.
The trick is that if you prep a very specific frame before play
begins, you can accidentally deprotagonize the PCs by stealing
the players’ agency.
For example, the PCs identify Claudette and where she lived.
What happens next? Well, they might head over to the mansion
in the afternoon, speak with Madame Rosette, and then
investigate Claudette’s room. But they could also decide that
they need to:
Execute a search warrant, barging past the confused and
mourning Madame Rosette.
Sneak into the mansion and investigate Claudette’s room in
the dead of night.
Threaten Madame Rosette and try to intimidate her into
revealing something.

And each of those scenes have distinctly different agendas and
bangs. They even have slightly different environments and
characters.
So I find it useful, when prepping a scene, to think of it like a
toybox that I’m filling with toys. I’ll be able to play with those
toys while running the session and use them to frame my
scenes, but I won’t be locked into a specific script with them.

Now, in practice, you’ll be able to make some educated guesses
about how scenes are likely to get framed during play, and you
can use those guesses to help you figure out what toys you can
prep. You don’t need to turn your brain off. You just need to
leave yourself open to play.
As you flesh out your scenes, whether they’re locations or
characters (or both), you’ll likely discover new opportunities to
plant clues that didn’t previously occur to you. That’s great! Don’t
hesitate to do so! Sometimes these new clues will emerge logically
and organically from what you’re creating; in other cases they’ll just
be cool ideas that seem to be spontaneously sparked by your
creative engagement. Either way, they’ll only deepen your scenario
and make it more robust. Just make sure to add them to your
revelation list for easy reference!
MAKING CLUES
“Now just connect them with clues!”
It may feel like we skipped a couple of steps there (“Just ‘make a
clue’ he says!”), but you’ll quickly find that’s not true. It really does
boil down to making a revelation list and then filling in three clues
(or more) under each revelation.
With that being said, let me share a few practical tips I’ve learned
about making clues. First, there are some broad categories into
which clues can fall:
Physical Artifacts
Glyphs/Data

Biosignatures
Interrogation
Surveillance

These categories aren’t exactly comprehensive, and the
boundaries between them aren’t exactly razor-sharp, but they can
get you started. If you’re looking for something a little more
specific, here are some examples from scenarios I’ve designed:
Correspondence (letters, email, etc.)
Diaries

Ephemera from a location (matchbooks, theatrical posters, tickets,
etc.)
Official reports

Tracks (to be followed)
Tailing someone
Business cards
Fingerprints
DNA

Blood type (including fantastical types like “Vulcan”)
Graffiti

Financial records
Tattoos

Canvassing

Video/audio recordings

Mystic visions/strange dreams

Shipping information (tracking, postmarks, return addresses, etc.)
Books (including inscriptions, bookmarks, and marginalia)

Bureaucratic records/background checks
Again, not a comprehensive list, but if you’re struggling to fill in a
clue, running down this list and seeing if there’s anything that fits
the scenario can really save the day. Particularly because, as you’re
designing clues for your scenario, you’ll want to make sure to
include a wide variety of them.
This is partly about creating a more engaging investigation. (If the
PCs are just doing the same thing over and over and over again,
that’s less interesting than an adventure where they’re doing lots of
different things. And a puzzle isn’t really puzzling if the solution is
always the same thing.) But it’s also structurally important: If all the
clues are fundamentally similar, then it’s not just that the players
are doing the same thing over and over again; it’s that the players
must do that thing. And if they don’t think to do it, then they’ll miss
ALL the clues.
The Three Clue Rule is built on redundancy, but clues that are
overly similar to each other only provide a superficial redundancy.
It’s kind of like monoclonal agriculture: When all the bananas are
clones of each other, they’re all susceptible to the same pests and
can be universally wiped out by a single disease. Just so with
monoclonal clues, which can all fail simultaneously.
For example, if the PCs need to figure out that Tony is hiding out
at the Silver Rodeo, you might say:
They can ask Tony’s girlfriend, Susan.

They can ask Tony’s partner, Silvester.
They can ask Tony’s mother, Sara.

Those are three different clues. But if the players, for whatever
reason, don’t ask the people in Tony’s life where Tony is hiding—
because they don’t want to risk tipping him off, because they
erroneously conclude that Tony wouldn’t have told anyone where
he was going, or just because they don’t think to do it—then that
one failure will wipe out all of those clues.

The principle of permissive clues means that you shouldn’t
necessarily get rid of all these “redundant” clues, but for structural
purposes, they can be grouped together and only “count” as a single
clue on your revelation list for the purposes of the Three Clue Rule.
(You could even list it as “Question Susan, Silvester, or Sara,” for
example.)
As a final note, remember that the problem of monoclonal clues is
limited to the clues pointing to a single revelation. It’s fine to design
a scenario with lots and lots and lots of clues coming from talking to
people, as long as those clues are spread out across a bunch of
different revelations (each of which has varied clues of different
types also pointing to them).
Another good way to keep your clues varied is to work from the
skill list. If you’re looking for inspiration in creating your clues,
look at the skill list for the RPG you’re running. Pick any skill. How
could the PCs use that skill to get the information they need?
For example, let’s say you need a clue that points the PCs to Cai
Lijuan:
Cryptography? Cai’s left his diary, which he writes in a personal
code, in the drawer of the bedside table.

Locksmith? There must be something Cai locked up here. Let’s say
there’s a safe hidden behind a picture frame with documents
identifying Cai inside.
Photography? There’s a USB stick with photos. There’s nothing
that identifies Cai in the photos themselves, but you could check
the EXIF data.

Obviously not every skill will be relevant to every conclusion, but
if you have a particular piece of information in mind, running down
the skill list will probably make specific skills jump out and provide
ideas.
You can also work from the conclusion. This is why I
recommend starting with the revelation list for the scenario. It

allows you to focus very specifically on what in the current scene
can indicate the conclusions they need to make.
This may seem obvious, but I can get lost a surprising amount of
the time floating around in a haze of, “What clues would they find
here?” or “What clues would the bad guys have left?” You really
want to flip that around: Instead of thinking about what clues might
be in the scene, focus on what you need the current scene to tell the
PCs and then treat that as a puzzle or a problem to solve.
For example, imagine that the PCs are investigating a cabin on the
lake. If you start by asking yourself, “What clues would be in the
cabin?” that’s too broad. It’s too vague.
But if you instead say, “I need a clue that points the PCs to Cai
Lijuan,” that’s far more actionable:
There’s a crumpled envelope in the wastebasket addressed to Cai.
The property owner can identify Cai as the person who was
renting the cabin.
There’s a box of cold pizza in the fridge. Cai’s name is printed on
the delivery label.
The family vacationing in the next cabin down the lake met Cai
and knows his name.
Cai’s car is still parked at the cabin; the PCs can run the license
plate or VIN.

Something else along these same lines that can trip you up is the
fallacy of the perfect crime.
For example, let’s say that the PCs find an incriminating note that
gives them a vital clue … but wait! Why would the conspiracy let
the PCs find the note? Why wouldn’t they destroy it?!
Well, in some cases it’s carelessness or bad luck. In others, they’re
holding on to incriminating evidence that can give them leverage
over their fellow conspirators. Sometimes they’re planning to
destroy it, but they just haven’t yet. Sometimes the note has
information they need for a job, so they hold on to it until the job is

done. Maybe they have a sentimental attachment to the note
because it was written by their dead wife. And so forth.
Of course, this logic extends beyond incriminating notes.
Wouldn’t it make sense for the murderer to wear gloves or wipe
away their fingerprints? (Maybe they did and the clue is something
else. Or they tried, but missed a partial. Or they’re dumb. Or they
panicked. Or they wanted to, but got interrupted.)
Wouldn’t they have disabled the cameras? (Maybe they didn’t
spot the camera. Maybe they did hack the cameras and deleted the
footage, but left traces from their hack that can be traced instead.
And so forth.)
The perfect crime or conspiracy, of course, would have flawless
operational security and leave no evidence. As a GM designing
scenarios you can be particularly susceptible to the fallacy of the
perfect crime: Obviously if the bad guy knew they were leaving a
clue, they would destroy it. You just thought of how the criminal
could have left the clue, so obviously the criminal would have
realized that, too!
But that’s not how it usually plays out in reality, and doesn’t
really make for a great scenario in any case. You actually want to do
the opposite: If you’re thinking about the crime and can’t find a clue
that gives the PCs the information you need to give them … well,
what extra mistake did the criminal make that will let you give the
PCs that information?
NON-ESSENTIAL REVELATIONS
In addition to your revelation list, there may be a lot of other
information that PCs can discover or deduce in the course of
their investigation: that the villain beats her husband; the
particular effects of the poison the killer is using; the cult’s
beliefs on the wisdom of cats.
If these are essential revelations (i.e., it’s important or
necessary for the PCs to learn this fact in order for the scenario

to work), then they should go on your revelation list and
should follow the Three Clue Rule.
But a lot of this information will be non-essential revelations.
(For example, the fact that the villain beats her husband is
interesting—and maybe the PCs could even figure out some
way to use that to their advantage—but it’s not something the
PCs need to know in order to track her down and bring her to
justice.) Non-essential revelations don’t need to follow the
Three Clue Rule (although they certainly can), and it’s up to
you whether you think it’s useful to keep a non-essential
revelations list. (I generally don’t, and if you do decide to keep
such a list, I recommend keeping it separate from your main
revelations list. You really want to keep your focus on that
essential structure.)

RUNNING YOUR MYSTERY

You’ve now carefully laid out a scenario in which there are multiple
paths to the solution and the players will always be flush with the
clues they need to keep the mystery moving forward. You’ve even
got a proactive backup plan designed to get the PCs back on track if
anything should go awry!
Nothing could possibly go wrong!
… why do we even say things like that?
Most of the time, if you follow the Three Clue Rule, your mystery
scenarios are going to work out just fine. But the truth is that you
are either a mouse or a man (probably the latter) and, sooner or
later, your best-laid plans are going to go awry. When that happens,
you’re going to want to be prepared for the possibility of spinning
out new backup plans on the fly.
To make this a little easier, you can use your revelation list as a
checklist, tracking which clues the PCs have found. As they grab
each clue, simply check them off the list or cross them out entirely,
whichever works best for you. If they miss a clue, circle it or put a

star next to it or something like that. (They might still circle back
later and find it after all, but you should assume that they won’t.)
This will let you see, at a glance, if there are conclusions where
the PCs are in jeopardy because they’ve missed two clues: If there
are three clues pointing them toward the dwarven alchemy lab, for
example, and they’ve missed two of them, then you’ll want to keep a
close eye on that third and final clue to make sure the PCs find it.
Finally, listen carefully to what the players are saying to each
other. When they’ve actually reached a particular conclusion, you
can check that whole conclusion off your list and stop worrying
about it. (But be careful not to cross it off as soon as the players
discuss it as a possibility. Only check it off if they’ve actually
concluded that it’s true.)
If you see that too many clues for a conclusion are being missed,
or that all the clues have been found but the players still haven’t
figured it out, then you’ll know it’s probably time to start thinking
about new clues that can be worked into the adventure. (This is
where your proactive elements will come in handy!)

NODE-BASED
ADVENTURES

A mystery chain is a great way to design your first mystery
adventure because the linear sequence of investigation scenes
simplifies and makes very clear what’s required in each scene for a
robust scenario, but the reality is that the chain is a rather
restrictive set of training wheels. If you’ve done your homework,
you’ve probably already felt yourself chafing against its limitations.
The primary problem, of course, is its lack of flexibility. It’s very
similar to our example of a linear dungeon:

Like the linear dungeon, it drastically constrains not only our
design options, but the players’ ability to make dynamic and
interesting choices during play. Even with the Three Clue Rule, the
linearity makes the scenario more fragile than it needs to be as each
scene becomes a chokepoint, and any scene that goes awry or
proves more challenging than you’d anticipated becomes a
roadblock.
Even fulfilling the Three Clue Rule within the strictures of the
mystery chain is more challenging than it needs to be. It can be very
hard to force three leads all pointing to the same conclusion into the
same scene—but absolutely no leads pointing to any other locations
or people associated with the mystery!—and have it feel natural. In
many ways, you’re simultaneously trying to cram too much
information into a single scene AND artificially limiting the
information the PCs are allowed to access.
So once you’ve made one or two adventures using the mystery
chain recipe and learned what you need to from it, it’ll be time to
break the bondage of the chain. And you can do that by taking
everything we’ve learned about mystery scenarios and flipping it on
its head.

INVERTING THE THREE CLUE RULE

The Three Clue Rule states:
For any conclusion you want the PCs to make, include at least
three clues.
The underlying theory, as you know, is that having three distinct
options provides sufficient redundancy to create a robust scenario:
Even if the PCs miss the first clue and misinterpret the second, the
third clue provides a final safety net to keep the scenario on track.
But you can also invert this logic:
If the PCs have access to ANY three clues, they will reach at
least ONE conclusion.
This is true if all three clues point to the same conclusion, but it’s
also true if the three clues point to different conclusions. In other
words, if the PCs need to reach three conclusions (A, B, and C) and
the PCs have access to three clues, each of which could theoretically
allow them to reach one of those conclusions, then it’s very likely
that they will, in fact, reach at least one of those conclusions. (They
could, of course, also make all three conclusions.)
Assume for the moment that each of those conclusions is an
investigation scene—which we’re now going to refer to as a node—
and the clues are leads pointing to those nodes. The diagram on the
facing page illustrates a simple example.
The scenario starts in the initial node of Node 1, which contains
three leads—one pointing to Node A, one pointing to Node B, and
one pointing to Node C. Following the Inverse Three Clue Rule, we
can be fairly certain that the PCs will be able to successfully
conclude that they need to go to at least one of these nodes.
Let’s assume they go to Node A. Node A contains two additional
clues—one pointing to Node B and the other pointing to Node C.

At this point the PCs have access to five different clues. One of
these has successfully led them to Node A and is no longer
important, but this still leaves them with four clues (two pointing to
Node B and two pointing to Node C), and the Inverse Three Clue
Rule once again shows us that they have more than enough
information to proceed in their investigation.
Let’s assume they now go to Node C. Here they can find clues to
Node A and Node B. They now have access to a total of seven clues,
and even though four of these clues now point to nodes they’ve
already visited, that still leaves them with three clues pointing them
to Node B. The Three Clue Rule itself shows that they now have
access to enough information to finish the scenario.
(Note that we’re only talking about clue access here. This doesn’t
mean that they’re guaranteed to find or correctly interpret every
clue. In fact, we’re still assuming that they don’t.)

NODES

What makes node-based scenario design so powerful is the almost
infinite flexibility of what a node can be.
LOCATIONS
A place where the PCs can physically go. If you think of a lead as
being anything that tells you where to go next, telling the PCs about
a specific place that they’re supposed to go is the most literal
interpretation of the concept. Once PCs arrive at a location, they’ll
usually find more clues by searching the place.
PEOPLE
A specific individual that the PCs should pay attention to. It may be
someone they’ve already met or it may be someone they’ll have to

track down. PCs will usually get clues from people by either
observing them or questioning them.
ORGANIZATIONS
Organizations can often be thought of as a collection of locations
and people, but it’s not unusual for a particular organization to
come collectively within the PCs’ sights (e.g., “It looks like the
Oberon Trust is involved in all this”). Organizations can be both
formal and informal; acknowledged and unacknowledged.
EVENTS
Something that happens at a specific time and, more often than not,
a specific place. Although PCs will often be tasked with preventing a
particular event from happening, when events are used as nodes
(i.e., something from which clues can be gathered), it’s more typical
for the PCs to actually attend the event, whether openly or
surreptitiously. (On the other hand, learning about an event may
lead the PCs to the location where it’s being held; the organization
responsible for holding it; or the people attending it.)
ACTIVITIES
An activity is something that the PCs are supposed to do. If the PCs
are supposed to learn about a cult’s plan to perform a binding ritual,
that’s an event. If they’re supposed to perform a binding ritual
themselves, that’s an activity. Activities are often ancillary
revelations, but if the activity would result in the PCs gaining clues,
then it counts as a node. (For example, the PCs might gain leads
telling them that they need to cast a legend lore spell in front of a
specific painting.)
NODES AS SCENARIOS
While you were designing your first mystery scenario, we talked
about how you could include dungeons, heists, and other scenarios
as investigation scenes (see here). That, of course, remains true with

node-based scenario design: Any node can be prepped using an
appropriate scenario structure.

NON-LINEAR DESIGN

Let’s revisit the murder of Claudette:

In the linear mystery chain version of this scenario, the PCs
discover Claudette’s body (NODE 1) and are able to identify her,
leading them to Claudette’s home (NODE A). At the mansion, they
discover burnt letters hinting at a secret affair with Lord Denton, a
suspicion that is confirmed when they question the maid! Rushing
over to Lord Denton’s mansion (NODE B), they confront him with
the scandalous evidence. A distraught Lord Denton reveals that he
and Claudette would meet at the Old Forsyth Crypt (NODE C) in
New Hope Cemetery. They were supposed to meet there yesterday,
but he was detained in a cabinet meeting and, by the time he
arrived, Claudette was no longer there. The PCs thank Lord Denton
and promise him whatever discretion they can, and then head
toward the cemetery, hoping to find more clues …
This scenario obviously works. Everything flows logically and the
clues come hot and heavy, keeping the PCs in the chase. (Again,
there’s nothing wrong with a well-designed mystery chain.) But
what if we designed this same scenario as a node-based adventure?
As the PCs investigate Claudette’s body (NODE 1), we don’t need
all of the clues to point to Claudette’s house. Instead, we could have
three different clues point to three different nodes:
Node A-Claudette’s Home: Searching the alley near where the
body is found will turn up Claudette’s identification.

Node B-Lord Denton: In the pocket of Claudette’s coat is a coat
check receipt signed by Lord Denton.
Node C-Old Forsyth’s Crypt: In Claudette’s purse is a charcoal
rubbing. Research can reveal that it was taken from the wall of
the Old Forsyth Crypt at New Hope Cemetery.

With no additional effort (you’re still just prepping three clues,
right?), there are suddenly many different ways that the adventure
could play out. The PCs might still go to Claudette’s house first and
discover her affair with Lord Denton, but decide that he’s too
powerful and they should pursue their other leads first.
Or maybe they go to Lord Denton first, but without concrete proof
(and maybe a flubbed Persuasion check) Denton gives them the cold
shoulder. After discovering the burnt letters in Claudette’s room,
however, the PCs return and furiously demand answers!
Or perhaps they miss both the identification papers and the coat
check receipt in the first scene, leaving them with no choice but to
check out the Old Forsyth Crypt. There they find where Claudette
has recently and impetuously carved “Claudette + Mountblanc” in a
tree just outside the crypt. They don’t know who Claudette is, but
“Mountblanc” leads them to Lord Denton Mountblanc, who breaks
down in tears when he learns that Claudette has been killed.
My point here is that when you create interesting nodes, you’ll
generally find that those nodes can be shuffled into virtually any
order and you’ll still end up with an interesting result. Importantly,
these variations aren’t just a matter of random noise. Given a
broader context, the players are able to strategize their
investigation, and the choices they make will have a meaningful
impact on how events play out. The PCs might even decide to split
up and pursue two leads at the same time.
Up to this point, we’ve also only looked at these choices in the
context of relatively static nodes, but we can also imagine more
dynamic scenarios in which the players’ choices of when and how to
pursue their investigation become even more meaningful. For
example, if they strong-arm Lord Denton before they have evidence,

then when they circle back later they might discover that he’s
disappeared. Now add a proactive node to this scenario: How might
the PCs’ actions tip off the vampire and when does she dispatch her
consorts to deal with them? In other scenarios you might find ways
to add different consequences to different leads, for example by
introducing a deadline: Will the PCs choose a safer-but-longer
course of action, or will they pursue the lead that’s quicker but risks
tipping off Boss Boar that he’s under investigation?
As a GM, I find these types of scenarios more interesting to run
because I’m also being surprised and delighted by how events play
out at the table. And as a player I find them more interesting
because I’m being allowed to make meaningful choices.
Furthermore, when an individual scenario is placed within the
context of a large campaign, it allows the choices made within that
scenario to have a wider impact. For example, if they expose Lord
Denton’s affair and ruin his engagement, he could easily return as
an antagonist in future scenarios. If Lord Denton owes them a favor
and becomes their patron, that’s a completely different campaign. If
they screw up and Lord Denton gets turned into a vampiric consort,
that’s yet another campaign.
On a more basic level, the fact that the players are being offered
the driver’s seat is meaningful in its own right. Even if the choice
doesn’t have any lasting impact on the final conclusion of “good
guys win, bad guys lose,” the fact that the players were the ones who
decided how the good guys were going to win is important. If for no
other reason than that, in my experience, it’s more fun for
everybody involved. And more memorable.

STRUCTURING NODE-BASED SCENARIOS

As we talk about the various paths that the PCs can take through a
node-based scenario, it’s important to remember that we’re not
prepping the paths, we’re prepping the destinations. We’re not
writing a Choose Your Own Adventure novel and we don’t need to
plan out every choice (or, worse yet, sequence of choices) the
players might make. It’s much more like building a playground:

You’re installing the equipment, but it’s ultimately the kids who
decide where they’re going to run, what they’re going to play with,
and, importantly, how they’re going to play with it.
With that being said, just like a theme park designer (in this
increasingly tortured analogy), there is still a great deal of structure
that you can control in node-based scenario design. If you put
something in the front of the “park,” for example, it’s far more likely
to be one of the first things the PCs experience than something that
you put all the way at the back of the park. Because node-based
scenario design is primarily about the flow of information, the
“front” and “back” of the park—the “near” nodes and the “far”
nodes, if you will—is about which clues are placed in which nodes,
and how many of those nodes the PCs will need to maneuver their
investigation through to reach the clues, location, and/or person
that will bring the scenario to a close.
So let’s take a peek at some of these node structures.
CONCLUSIONS
Conclusions can be achieved by funneling leads toward a specific
node.

In this design, for example, each node in the second layer contains
a third clue that points to the concluding Node D. The function
should be fairly self-explanatory: The PCs can chart their own
course through Nodes A, B, and C while being gently directed
toward their goal, which is located at Node D.
One potential “problem” with this structure is that it allows the
PCs to potentially bypass content: They could easily go to Node A,
find the clue for Node D, and finish the adventure without ever
visiting Nodes B or C.
I put the word “problem” in quotes here, though, because in nodebased scenario design this is often desirable. When the PCs make a
choice to avoid something—either because they don’t want to deal
with it or because they don’t want to invest the resources needed to
engage with it—and figure out a way to bypass it or make do
without it, that’s almost always fodder for an interesting moment at
the gaming table. For example, the choice to deliberately not
approach Lord Denton is an interesting and significant choice, and it
makes the existence of the Lord Denton node meaningful to the
scenario even though (and, in fact, because) the PCs never meet him.
In practice, there will often be an incentive for the PCs to
investigate the other nodes instead of skipping them. I’ve found this
to be true to at least some degree even if you don’t deliberately
design those incentives, but of course you can do that, too, with a
mixture of carrots and sticks. For example, the lead in Node A might
be a map of Node D (useful for planning tactical assaults), the clue
in Node B might be a snitch who can tell them about a secret
entrance that doesn’t appear on the map (another carrot), and Node
C might include a goon squad that will reinforce Node D if they
aren’t mopped up ahead of time (a stick).
In other scenarios like this, the PCs won’t necessarily know right
away that Node D is where they need to go. So with multiple clues
in hand after Node A, they might still semi-randomly decide to
check out Node B or Node C before following their lead to Node D.
In other cases, they’ll simply miss the first lead to Node D they have
an opportunity to find. After leaving the initial node and

investigating Node A, after all, they’re twice as likely to have found
a clue pointing to Node B or Node C.
All of this means that the PCs doing a speedrun straight to Node D
—even though it looks so incredibly trivial if you have the privilege
of looking at the node list (which, of course, the players do not)—is
a lot less common than you might think, and it’s rarely a problem
even when it does happen. In practice, I never really think about it,
and everything works out just fine. (It’s one of the benefits of the
immense flexibility of node-based scenario design.)
FUNNELS
Funnels take the basic structure of the conclusion and simply
expand it:

Each layer in the funnel—e.g., Nodes A, B, and C; or Nodes E, F,
and G—is a free-form environment for investigation or exploration
that gradually leads toward the neck of the funnel (Nodes D or H).
The neck then contains the clues leading them into the next freeform environment.
I find this structure useful for campaigns where an escalation of
stakes or opposition is desirable. For example, the PCs might start
out investigating local drug dealers (Nodes A, B, C) in an effort to
find out who’s supplying drugs to the neighborhood. When they
identify the local distributor (Node D), his contacts lead them into a
wider investigation of citywide gangs (Nodes E, F, G). Investigating

the gangs takes them to the Tyrell crime family (Node H), and
mopping up the crime family gets them tapped for a national Mafia
task force (another layer of free-form investigation), culminating in
the discovery that the Mafia are actually being run by the Illuminati
(another funnel neck).
(The Illuminati, of course, are being run by alien reptoids. The
reptoids by Celestials. And the Celestials by the sentient network of
black holes at the center of our galaxy. The black-hole
consciousness, meanwhile, has suffered a schizoid bifurcation due to
an incursion by the Andromedan Alliance … wait, where was I?)
In other words, there’s always a bigger fish! This funnel structure
is well suited for D&D campaigns. You don’t want 1st-level
characters suddenly “skipping ahead” to mind flayers, so you can
use the chokepoints or gateways of the funnel structure to move
them from one power level to the next. And if they hit a gateway
that’s too tough for them right now, that’s okay: They’ll simply be
forced to back off, gather their resources (level up), and come back
when they’re ready.
Another advantage of the funnel structure is that, in terms of
prep, it gives you manageable chunks to work on: Since the PCs
can’t proceed to the next layer until they reach the funnel neck, you
only need to prep the current “layer” of the campaign.
LAYER CAKES
Layer cakes achieve the same general sense of progression that a
funnel structure gives you, but allow you to use a lighter and looser
touch in structuring the scenario.

As illustrated, the most basic structure of the layer cake is that
each node in a particular “layer” gives you clues that lead to other
nodes on the same layer plus one clue pointing to a node in the next
layer. Although a full exploration of the first layer won’t give the
PCs three clues to any single node on the second layer, they’ll have
three clues pointing to the second layer collectively. Therefore, the
Inverted Three Clue Rule means that they’ll reach at least one node
in the second layer, and from there they can begin collecting
additional second layer clues.
An interesting feature of the layer cake, in practice, is that
whereas PCs in a funnel design are unlikely to back up past the last
funnel neck (e.g., once they reach Node E, they generally won’t back
to Node C because it has nothing to offer them), in a layer cake
design such interlayer, back-and-forth movement is quite common.
Layer cakes, therefore, have a slightly larger design profile than
funnels, but allow the GM to curtail the scope of their prep work
(i.e., you only need to design the current and next layer of the cake)

while allowing the PCs to move through a more realistic
environment. You’ll often find the underlying structure of the layer
cake arising naturally out of the game world.
LARGE LAYERS
In case it hasn’t been clear, I’ve been using three-node layers in
these examples because it’s a convenient number for showing
structure. But there’s nothing magical about the number. A
“layer” can be made up of any number of nodes; their defining
characteristic is simply that they contain clues pointing to other
nodes in the same layer and/or the next layer down (whether
that next layer is a conclusion, the neck of a funnel, or another
full layer of nodes).
As long as
each node has a minimum of three leads in it,

each node has a minimum of three leads pointing to it, and
each layer has at least three leads pointing to it from the
“layer” above it,

then the Three Clue Rule and its inversion will be naturally
satisfied and guarantee you a sufficiently robust flow through
the layer.
Larger layers, of course, require more prep, but that larger scale
can be a feature in itself. They also give you the opportunity to
vary the number of clues in each node, creating a greater range
of node experiences. (Particularly dense clue locations could
have six or eight or ten clues all pointing in different
directions.)
LOOPS

Loops are a different way of thinking about how nodes can connect
to each other. The other node structures we’ve looked at are all
focused on a forward momentum: The PCs are moving toward the
conclusion or the neck of the funnel or the next layer of nodes (or
all of the above). Loops, on the other hand, can be a more
naturalistic arrangement, where nodes are related to each other but
not necessarily as a hierarchy or progression.
For example, here’s a simple loop:

In this example, all four nodes contain three clues pointing to the
other three nodes. The advantage of this structure is that the PCs
can enter the scenario at any point and navigate it completely.
(Whereas a PC entering Node D in our layer cake example would
never find their way back to Nodes A, B, or C.)
Obviously, this is only really useful if the PCs have multiple ways
of getting led into the loop. If the loop constitutes the entire
adventure, then that would mean seeding different scenario hooks
(see here) into your campaign, each pointing at a different node.
DEAD ENDS
Dead ends in a linear scenario are generally disasters. They mean
that the PCs have taken a wrong turn or failed to draw the right
conclusions and now they’re going to crash into a wall: There

should be a clue for them to follow, but they’re not seeing it, so
there’s nowhere to go, and the whole adventure is going to fall
apart.
But handled properly in a node-based scenario, dead ends aren’t a
problem: This lead may not have panned out, but the PCs still have
other clues to follow.
Such dead ends can emerge naturally: The PCs go to Node A, but
for whatever reason fail to find any of the clues there, so they pick
up one of the other clues they found earlier and head over to Node
B hoping to have better luck.
But you can also deliberately put dead ends in your scenarios:

In this example, Node E is the dead end. Clues at Node B and
Node C suggest that it should be checked out, but there’s nothing to
be found there. Maybe the clues were just wrong; or the bad guys
have already cleared out; or it looked like a good idea, but it didn’t
pan out into usable information; or it’s a trap deliberately laid to
catch the PCs off guard. Alternatively, the location can contain
valuable evidence, even though it doesn’t have any leads to other
nodes. The possibilities of a dead end are pretty much limitless.
The trick to implementing a dead end is to think of the leads
pointing to the dead end as “bonus clues.” They don’t count toward
the maxim that each node needs to include three different clues.
(Otherwise you risk creating paths through the scenario that could

result in the PCs being left with less than three clues. This is not
necessarily disastrous in practice, but, according to the Inverse
Three Clue Rule, might be.)
On the other hand, as you can see, you don’t need to include three
leads pointing to the dead end, either. It’s a dead end, so if the PCs
don’t see it, there’s nothing to worry about. It’s what we referred to
as a non-essential revelation (see here).
Of course, if you include less than three leads pointing to the dead
end, you’re increasing the chances that you’re prepping content that
will never be seen. But this also means that the discovery of the
dead end might constitute a special reward—extra treasure, lost
lore, a special weapon attuned to their enemy, etc.
This is also a good reminder that dead ends may be logistical
blind alleys, but that doesn’t mean they should be boring or
meaningless. Quite the opposite, in fact.
PROACTIVE NODES
Just like you can have proactive scenes in a mystery chain scenario,
you can have proactive nodes. These are the nodes that come to the
PCs and interact with them.
Proactive nodes are usually characters. I often think of them as
the “response teams” of a scenario. This is frequently literal, with
my proactive nodes being the people who are sent to deal with the
PCs once the bad guys realize they’re snooping around. But it’s also
a useful metaphor: Proactive nodes are the easiest tools you, as the
GM, can use to take action at the table instead of just reacting to
what the players are doing.
What about other proactive nodes?
Well, locations tend to be stationary and rarely follow people
around … unless you apply sufficiently advanced technology and/or
magic. The technology doesn’t really need to be all that advanced,
either: An abandoned ghost ship drifting into the town’s harbor can
easily be a proactive node.
Organizations can be proactive in their responses, but the
response usually takes the form of a specific response team.

Events can be proactive if they’re of a sufficiently large scale or if
they’re specifically targeted at the PCs: A citywide festival or a ritual
that causes all the trees in the forest to start weeping blood count as
the former. A series of enigmatic phone calls that ring up a PC’s cell
phone would be an example of the latter.
Almost anything can be a proactive node if it can be framed as
information being pushed on the PCs. For example, if the PCs are
cops investigating a series of bank robberies, they would be
automatically notified if a new bank robbery takes place. (Is this an
event or a location? Both? Does it matter? Don’t get too obsessed
with categories here.)
Don’t forget to add a clue or three to your proactive nodes: They
can be used to create a living world where there are both long-term
and short-term reactions to the PCs’ choices, but they also have the
practical function of getting the scenario back on track.

THINKING BEYOND THE DIAGRAMS

The various node structures we’ve looked at can all be used together
in an almost infinite variety of ways. After all, any node can be
linked to any other node by simply including an appropriate lead,
right? So you can easily glue these structures to each other. A funnel
is basically just a conclusion with another conclusion pasted onto its
final node. And you can easily design a layer cake of any length and
then have its final layer terminate in a conclusion, or have a
different layer cake narrow into a funnel before expanding back out
into another layer cake. (Feel free to paste a dead end onto any of
these pretty much anywhere you’d like.)
As you begin experimenting with nodes, you also need to quickly
start thinking outside of the diagrams. I’ve used diagrams to
illustrate how leads can be distributed between scenes and how that
distribution can affect the flow of a scenario, but they’ll prove quite
deceptive if you try to use them as a basis for your scenario design.
First, the diagrams already “cheat” in terms of showing all the
leads involved. If you look at the diagram for the conclusion

structure on here, for example, you’ll note that the leads linking
Nodes A, B, and C to each other are not indicated with arrows.
The diagrams also feature a perfect symmetry, which should
almost certainly be honored more in the breach than the
observance. It’s, again, useful for clearly illustrating certain
concepts, but it’s usually a little too trite and a little too constraining
if it limits your actual adventure design.
I may occasionally sketch out diagrams like this to help
conceptualize the broad strokes of an adventure (“the street gangs
can funnel into the local distributor, and then the distributor can
have leads to …”), but once I’m in the trenches the utility rapidly
fades.
So if it’s not flowcharts and diagrams, what tool do you use to
design node-based scenarios?
The good ol’ revelation list.
Here’s an example of a node-based revelation list:
SCENE 1: ELVEN CORPSES
The Duke’s Map (Scenario Hook)

Encountering Mutilated Corpses (Adventure 3: The Old Forest)
Reports of Mutilated Corpses (Adventure 2, Scene 4)
SCENE 2: THE BLACK TREE
Tracking Drow Scouts (Proactive 1: Drow Scouts/Scene 1: Elven
Corpses)
Map to the Black Tree (Scene 3: The Drow Camp)

Elven Retaliation Scrolls (Proactive 2: Elven Retaliation Squad)
SCENE 3: THE DROW CAMP
Tracking Drow Scouts (Proactive 1: Drow Scouts)

Elven Retaliation Scrolls (Proactive 2: Elven Retaliation Squad)
Map of the Old Forest (Scene 4: Drow Citadel)

Questioning Prisoners (Scene 2: The Black Tree)
SCENE 4: DROW CITADEL
Questioning Prisoners (Scene 2: The Black Tree)

Subverting the Crystal Ball (Scene 3: The Drow Camp)
Following the Slave Train (Scene 3: The Drow Camp)

Like the revelation list from a mystery chain on here, you’ll note
that I’ve indicated where the clue can be found in parentheses after
the clue. (This notably includes leads found in other adventures that
point to Scene 1 of this adventure. These cross-scenario leads serve
as scenario hooks—in this case, additional scenario hooks—for the
adventure.)
There are actually two ways you can organize lists like this: You
can list all the clues a node contains or you can list all the clues that
point to the node. We refer to the former as a clue list and the latter
as a revelation list.
The revelation list, as we’ve seen, is most useful when we’re
running a scenario. It also makes it easy to confirm that you’ve
honored the Three Clue Rule for all of your revelations.
When outlining or developing a scenario, however, the clue list is
often more useful. After coming up with the “big concept” for a
scenario, my design process usually starts with writing down cool
ideas for various nodes. Then I’ll think about what kind of
information a node might naturally contain to point at the other
nodes. For example, I might jot down:
SCENE 2: THE BLACK TREE

Questioning Prisoners (to the Drow Citadel)

Questioning Prisoners (to the Drow Camp)

Drow Scouts might show up here (track to Scene 1 or Scene 3)
Once I’ve done that for all the nodes, I’ll do a quick audit of each
node and make sure I’ve included three clues. If I haven’t, I’ll get

proactive figuring out how I can creatively include more clues.
As I write up the full version of each node, though, I’ll assemble
the revelation list: Each clue I include in the full write-up gets listed
in the revelation list under the node it’s pointing to (with a crossreference back to where it’s found).
This allows me to double-check my design process to make sure
I’ve got all the clues I need. But it’s also important because, when it
comes time to run the scenario, it’s the revelation list that’s
essential.
CLUE LISTS AT THE TABLE?
Wouldn’t it be useful to have a clue list at the table, too?
Not as much as you might think. The trick is that the clues are
baked into the key for your adventure (the description of the
investigation scenes, locations, NPCs, etc.). If your key is
properly and clearly organized, then when you’re running a
location or NPC or whatever, the associated clues should be
obvious and easily accessible, so you don’t need a separate
checklist for them.
If your key isn’t well organized (and, therefore, you might miss
the clues), you should, of course, fix it. It’ll cause a lot more
problems than just missed clues.
In terms of really understanding how a particular scenario
“works,” though, the revelation list can feel confusing if you’re not
familiar with it. It can feel more intuitive to look at a list of clues in
a node and then follow where they lead. (This is, after all, how the
PCs will conceptually work their way through the scenario.) But you
can get that same sense of flow from a revelation list: You just need
to work backward.
Look at a node and ask, “How would the PCs get there?” In other
words, follow one of the clues on the revelation list back to its

source node. Then repeat the process from there.
For example, how would the PCs get to the Drow Citadel in the
scenario on page 256? Well, let’s pick a random clue: Following the
Slave Train from Scene 3: The Drow Camp. So we look at Scene 3
and pick a random node there: Tracking Drow Scouts from their
proactive scene. Since that’s a proactive scene, it’s essentially a
scenario origin point. It’s the trailhead, so to speak, and from the
trail we’ve followed we can see that “tracking bad guys through the
Old Forest” is one approach to the scenario.
Do it again: You can also get to the Drow Citadel by questioning
prisoners from Scene 2: The Black Tree. You can get to the Black
Tree by talking to (or stealing intelligence from) the elven
retaliation squads operating in the area. So here we have a path that
follows a trail of misery.
Do this two or three times (or more for more complex scenarios)
and you’ll get a pretty good feel for the contours of the scenario
structure.
As you begin exploring and creating larger and more complex
node-based scenarios and campaigns like this, what you’ll
eventually find waiting for you is the node cloud, in which there is
no predetermined and often not even a clear path of progression
(like that of the layer cake). Instead, there are just locations, people,
organizations, and events linked to each other in a multitude of
ways, and how the PCs choose to navigate those connections and
what their goals are will, ultimately, be driven by the players.
THE DUNGEON CLOUD
For a simpler example of a node cloud, consider a region in which
there are a bunch of ruins belonging to a primeval empire. In other
words, a bunch of dungeons. Each of these dungeons has clues and
treasure maps pointing to other dungeons in the region, but there’s
no particular sequence or escalation to these dungeons. The PCs
might find any one of them at random, and then follow the leads to
explore the rest in any order.

HOMEWORK
5 NODE MYSTERY
Let’s pull our heads out of the clouds for the moment and focus on
designing our first node-based scenario. We’ll get started by using
the 5 Node Mystery adventure recipe. This is a very powerful recipe.
It’s one that I use all the time while prepping adventures, and its
versatile simplicity makes it incredibly easy to deploy, even in the
middle of a session. The players declare out of the blue that they’re
going to do something completely unexpected? (“Let’s figure out
who’s selling silverweed!”) With a little practice, you’ll be able to
whip up a 5 Node Mystery so fast that you won’t even have to take a
break from play.
This straightforward simplicity, of course, also makes this recipe
ideal for your first node-based scenario. It’s particularly appealing
because you can use almost any adventure ingredients while
building your mystery.
It works like this:

STEP 1: THE SCENARIO CONCEPT
This works just like the scenario concept for a mystery chain (see
here): Was someone murdered? Was something stolen? Who did it?
Why did they do it?
STEP 2: THE HOOK
Again, just like the mystery chain. How do the PCs get involved?
How do they get pulled (or pushed!) into the initial node? This will
be where the investigation starts and it’ll be your Node A.
STEP 3: THE ENDING
And, once again: What’s the conclusion? Where do the PCs learn the
ultimate answers and/or get into a big fight with the bad guy? (Big
fights with bad guys are still a really easy way to manufacture a
satisfying conclusion.)
This will be your Node E.
STEP 4: THREE COOL NODES
Brainstorm three cool locations or people related to the mystery. A
seedy tavern down by the docks? Drug den filled with werewolves?
The doppelganger who has replaced the sultan’s vizier? These will
be your nodes B, C, and D.
As we’ve done before, I recommend brainstorming more than
three items, picking the three coolest ideas, and then seeing if you
can combine the other ideas with the three you picked before
throwing them out.
STEP 5: CONNECT THE NODES
You’ve got five nodes. Connect ’em with clues like this:

The basic idea here is that Node A points you in three different
directions (although, remember, the PCs might find only one of the
clues). Then those three locations point to each other and also point
to the big conclusion. Simple.
OPTIONAL: ANCILLARY REVELATIONS
The default 5 Node Mystery is a simple, procedural mystery: Follow
the clues from Node A, collect your conclusion at Node E.
But if you’d like, you can, of course, layer in any ancillary
revelations that make sense or would be cool to have.

RUN IT

Wait … is that it?
That’s it.
I wasn’t kidding when I said that the 5 Node Mystery was simple
and fast.
In running your 5 Node Mystery, of course, it’s possible for the
PCs to go from Node A to Node B to Node E (skipping Nodes C and
D). In some cases, the scenario will be modular enough that this
means the conclusion isn’t what you thought it was. (You thought
the conclusion was a big showdown with a bad guy in the violet
tower at the center of the graveyard. Turns out, it was actually a
rooftop chase as the badly injured PCs try to escape the werewolves
from the drug den.) In other cases, the nodes left behind the PCs

will metastasize into new adventures—either because the
werewolves end up causing trouble or because when the PCs go
back to mop up the werewolves they’ll find clues pointing them to
other scenarios.
ALTERNATIVE NODE STRUCTURES
It’s pretty easy to start experimenting with the default structure
of a 5 Node Mystery. For example, you might decide that Node
A only contains clues pointing to Nodes B and C. Those nodes
would then contain clues pointing to each other and Node D,
while Node D would be loaded up with a whole bunch of clues
pointing to the conclusion.
(Make sure to still include at least three clues in Node A!)
Or maybe Node A includes clues pointing to all the other nodes,
which form a loop. Or you add an extra node (which could be a
dead end). Whatever seems interesting or needed for the
scenario you’re working on.

HOMEWORK
5 X 5 CAMPAIGN
Up until now, you’ve likely been running linear campaigns: The PCs
play one scenario (a dungeon, a mystery, or whatever), finish it, and
then you hook them into the next scenario.

This linear structure, however, is not the only way to run a
campaign. In fact, the same node-based scenario structure we’ve
been using to design complex mystery scenarios can also be
expanded to a campaign structure, allowing you to use your mastery
of node-based design to build an interwoven campaign of
interconnected scenarios.
STEP 1: DESIGN FIVE 5 NODE MYSTERIES
As you’re designing these five mysteries, you might have some idea
of how they all relate to each other, but maybe not. Discovering
how seemingly unrelated things are actually connected to each
other is a great way to make both things richer and more
interesting.
STEP 2: CONNECT EACH SCENARIO AS A NODE
Arrange the five mysteries into the same node pattern as a 5 Node
Mystery. In other words:
Mystery A will have clues pointing to Mysteries B, C, and D.
Mystery B will have clues pointing to Mysteries C, D, and E.

Mysteries C and D will follow the same pattern as Mystery B
(pointing to each other and Mystery E).
If you didn’t already know how the mysteries related to each
other, the process of figuring out how clues for Mystery D ended up
over in Mystery B is the part where you figure that out. The possible
links between Mysteries can span the gamut of human experiences:
The victim in Mystery A was an employee of the werewolves in
Mystery B.

The “villain” in Mystery A was only doing what she did because
she was being blackmailed by someone in Mystery C.
The mercenaries in Mystery A have also been hired by the
reclusive millionaire in Mystery D.

The werewolves in Mystery B were created by the warlock in
Mystery E.

The blackmailer in Mystery C was investigating the warlock in
Mystery E.

The reclusive millionaire in Mystery D is murdered by the warlock
in Mystery E.
And so forth.
Each clue linking one Mystery to another will, of course, appear
in a specific node of the Mystery, and it’s usually a good idea to mix
this up a bit. Some clues will appear in Node E and serve as the
“payoff” for solving the Mystery: You’ve taken out El Pajarero, but
who was he working for?!
But don’t fall into the trap of always putting the clues in the
concluding node. Spread ’em around a bit.
This may mean that the PCs don’t necessarily finish one scenario
before bouncing into another: They encounter a clue in Node B of
one Mystery and follow it into a completely different Mystery. This
is great! In fact, because the nodes between scenarios are linked in
the same way that the nodes within a scenario are linked, the
players will often not even notice that this is happening. They won’t
know that there’s a difference between Mystery A and Mystery B,
and the entire campaign will unify into something greater and more
complicated than the sum of its parts.
EXPANDING THE CAMPAIGN
Because your 5 x 5 Campaign is using a node-based structure, you
can expand it in all the ways that you can expand any node-based
structure—funnels, layer cakes, free-form clouds, etc.
For example, you can take Mystery E of one 5 x 5 Campaign and
treat it as Mystery A of a second 5 x 5 Campaign, creating an easy
funnel. This structure can be ideal because it segments the campaign
into clearly delineated chunks, each of which is relatively easy to
prep.

It can also be great for D&D because a 5 x 5 Campaign is roughly
the perfect length for a single tier of play, so you can design one 5 x
5 Campaign for Tier 1, another for Tier 2, and so forth.
SWAPPING ADVENTURES
While building a 5 x 5 Campaign, you can take any or all of the
5 Node Mysteries and simply swap them out for a different type
of scenario. That might just be a larger node-based scenario,
but it could also be a dungeon (see here), raid (see here), or
heist (see here).
You still need to include the clues linking those scenarios to the
other scenarios in the campaign, of course, but this is easy to
do. For example, in a dungeon you can just key the clues to
various rooms.

THE WORLD—any

world—is filled with locations. That’s why
location-based scenario structures are so useful. Dungeons, also
known as location crawls, are one example of a location-based
adventure, but they’re not the only one.
Dungeons are primarily based on exploration. When the PCs first
enter the dungeon location, its layout and features are unknown,
and the focus of play is on discovering the hidden wonders that the
dungeon contains. Raids and heists, on the other hand, transform
the room-and-key structure by replacing exploration with tactical
and strategic planning. At the beginning of a raid scenario, the
expectation is that the players will know much or all of the
location’s layout and defenses, and the focus of play is on how they
can use that knowledge to plan their operation.
Because raids and heists are still location-based scenarios, we’ll be
using many of the same tools and techniques that we use while
running dungeon scenarios, but often in slightly different ways and
enhanced with a selection of new tools that help us fill these
scenarios with thrilling moments and unique challenges.

THE RAID
A raid scenario begins when the PCs identify an objective inside a
secure location. Arriving at the location, the PCs will be able to
perform a rapid survey to learn the floorplan and defenses of the
location. This information is not necessarily complete (with the PCs
still often encountering hidden elements and unexpected surprises
during the scenario), but it should be comprehensive enough that
the PCs can make a plan for how they’ll assault the location. They

will then execute their planned raid, most likely facing active
opposition that will strategically respond to the PCs’ actions.

OBJECTIVE

Every raid needs an objective. This makes a raid a great scenario
structure to pull out of your pocket when your players say they
want something: Just put the thing they want inside a secure
location and point them in the right direction.
Objectives will often be focused on a specific object:
Steal a valuable object.
Sabotage enemy material (or disrupt a dangerous ritual).

Plant evidence, install a listening device, or deposit some other
item.
Gather intelligence.
Secure or destroy infrastructure.

Other objectives will be aimed at a target:
Kill
Capture
Rescue

A common variant of this is clearing hostiles from a location by
killing, incapacitating, arresting, or otherwise neutralizing them.
There are also diversions, in which the goal is to distract some or
all of the denizens in a location for some period of time. (Diversions
will often also be part of the tactics used in other raids, but this is
slightly different from when the diversion itself is the objective.)
RAIDING THE MONSTER MANUAL
Instead of a human target, it can be fun to flip through the Monster
Manual: Identifying and assassinating a doppelganger, rustling blink

dogs, or rescuing an aboleth all pose unique challenges.
You can complicate a raid by introducing multiple objectives.
This can be done as a simple copy-and-paste (instead of killing one
target, you need to kill six of them; instead of stealing one dataruby, you need to steal three of them), but having objectives of
different types can often be more dynamic (you have to rescue
Gabriela and also kill Luisa Fernanda Pérez Rodríguez). A slight
variant of this is the multi-part objective (you need to steal the
hard drive, but first you need to use the location-locked security
USB that will decrypt its contents).
Generally, having multiple objectives is only meaningful if the
objectives are located in different areas. (It’s not more challenging
to steal three rubies than it is to steal one ruby if all three rubies are
sitting next to each other in a display case.) Other logistical
complications can also be effective, though. For example, if all the
targets are initially in one location but they’ll split up and go in
different directions when the alarm is raised, it either has the same
effect or provides a great motivation to the PCs to make sure they
don’t trigger any alarms.
You can also add a timing component to an objective.
A deadline requires the PCs to accomplish their objective by a
specific time (e.g., at midnight the lunar vault will vanish until
the next blue moon).

A time limit can begin at the same time as the raid or be triggered
during the raid (e.g., once the alarm is raised you’ll only have
five minutes before the data banks are automatically wiped).
A time requirement might be built into the objective (e.g., you
need to keep the USB plugged into the computer for 5 minutes to
complete the download, or your diversion has to last for 10
minutes).

As you prep the rest of the scenario, it will also be useful to
consider how an objective will impact the tactics the PCs can
employ while conducting the raid: If they need to rescue a hostage,
then stealth will probably be vital so that they don’t alert the
kidnappers and get the hostage killed. If they need to create a big
diversion, on the other hand, then stealth will probably only take
them so far.

FLOORPLAN

In designing the secure location that will be raided, you’re going to
use the same mapping techniques and symbols that you used for the
dungeon (see here). There are, however, a few specific things you’ll
want to keep in mind while designing your raid map.
First, remember that the location must be surveyable. The PCs
have to be able to observe the location from outside and figure out
the details of its floorplan and defenses so that they can formulate a
tactical plan. This will guide your design of the location because for
each feature you add, you’ll also want to think about how a survey
could reveal that feature.
Windows are your friend. Simply counting windows and knowing
their locations can tell the PCs a lot about a building’s floorplan,
and obviously looking through the windows can tell them even
more.
Try to avoid featureless square-block buildings. More varied
building outlines can, once again, let the PCs intuit a lot more
about the interior layout of the location (particularly in
combination with windows). If you use more varied buildings in
general, the occasional use of a square-block building when it’s
appropriate (e.g., a warehouse) will be revealing in its own right.
High vantage points, like a nearby hill or clock tower, can give
blueprint-style overviews of a location that would otherwise be
screened from view (e.g., the courtyard of a castle).

Keep the scale of the raid scenario manageable. The larger a
secure location gets, the more difficult it is to keep it surveyable.
(Although as the PCs become more skilled at executing raids,
they may discover surveying techniques that make larger
complexes more viable.)
With all that being said, it’s also true that a survey does not need
to reveal every single detail, so don’t feel like you need to add a
window to every room. We’ll discuss the details of a good survey
starting on here.
Second, where are the objective(s) of the raid located? Answering
this question might even provide the core scenario concept. (Where
would the Lytekkas Hypercorp store their DNA records?) It can be
useful to build out from the objective locations, making sure to
include multiple layers of defense that the PCs will need to bypass
or work their way through in order to reach their objective.
Keep in mind that an objective can also be mobile: It might be a
person or carried by a person. Or it might be periodically moved,
either as part of its function, as a security measure, or because
preparations are being made to ship it to another location.
Third, there should be multiple entrances. The core experience
of the raid scenario is making a tactical plan, and by putting the
choice of entrance front and center, you’re immediately framing the
scenario in those terms for the players. They literally have to make a
tactical choice to begin the scenario, which will naturally draw
them into thinking through the tactical consequences of that choice.
To that end, each entrance should be either secured, hidden, or
both.
A secured entrance, in this sense, just means that there’s some
form of obstacle or cost required to use the entrance. This might be:
security guards

security cameras
a trap

a skill check required to use the entrance (climbing, picking the
lock, etc.)
an entrance that can only be used one-way (e.g., sealing behind
the PCs after they enter), forcing the raid to find a different
means of egress

A hidden entrance is one that may not be detected during the
site survey. To discover it might require:
a skill check
a specific action

a special resource or ability
Finding a hidden entrance will usually be beneficial. It might have
lower security (or no security), or it might provide access to a
shorter or more advantageous route to the PCs’ objective.
As far as entrances are concerned, it should be noted that
windows are entrances. So if your raid locations offer a realistic
number of windows (or skylights or the like), the requirement to
have multiple entrances will usually take care of itself.
Fourth, once the PCs are inside the location, there should
continue to be tactical choices. You can largely accomplish this by
xandering your raid location, just like a dungeon (see here). If there
are multiple routes that can be taken to the objective, varied
defenses along each route, and any form of imperfect information
(either because features are hidden or because of a failed survey),
interesting tactical choices will tend to materialize. (And that’s even
before taking into account the varied actions of security forces
during actual play.)
Finally, since the goal is for the PCs to be able to learn the
floorplan, it can be useful to prep blueprints that you can give to
the players. These might represent actual blueprints obtained by the
PCs (although this is more common in heist scenarios, see here), but
they can also just be a convenient player reference for what their
characters learn during their survey. Either way, having the physical

blueprints at the table will encourage and enable the players to
make their tactical plan.
MOBILE LOCATIONS
Staging raids on mobile locations—military convoys, cruise ships,
trains, airships, etc.—is a fun twist that can also be used to create
unique challenges for your players.

DEFENSES

The defenses securing a raid location can be either passive
obstacles (locks, traps, physical challenges, etc.) or active forces
(guards, patrols, response teams, etc.). The experience you had
designing similar elements for your dungeon scenarios will transfer
pretty much directly into your raid scenarios, but there are a couple
bits of good praxis that can be useful.
First, because the success or failure of a raid scenario often hinges
on managing and manipulating the active forces onsite, defenses
that raise an alarm can be very effective, and are likely to be more
common than in most dungeon scenarios. Alarms might be a loud
noise (or similar alert) that will attract active forces in the
immediate area, or they might be a signal to remote security
personnel that will bring them from their area of operations to the
area of the alarm. Alarms can include having active forces who
detect the PCs and respond by shouting for help or sending a
runner.
Second, I highly recommend including a patrol in almost any raid
scenario. As alarms are raised and adversaries are activated (see
here), the raid scenario will become increasingly dynamic, forcing
the PCs to respond to an ever-evolving tactical situation. Having one
or more patrols designed into the scenario will bake this dynamic
aspect into the scenario from the very beginning. Patrols are also
something of a unique challenge, however, because they will usually
have regular cycles of movement, allowing the PCs to survey them,

figure out their patterns, and use those patterns to avoid or even
subvert the patrols.

SURVEY

At the beginning of a raid scenario, the PCs will perform a survey of
the secure location in order to determine the floorplan and defenses.
We can break this down further into four specific lists:
Entries
Rooms

Passive Obstacles
Active Forces

You may not need to literally make lists for each of these.
(They’re already detailed in your prep notes, right?) But you might
find listing them a valuable exercise the first couple times you
design a raid scenario, and thinking of them as a list can be
conceptually useful regardless: Before the survey, it’s a list of things
that the PCs don’t know, and the goal of the survey is to slide some
or all of those items onto a new list of known elements.
CHALLENGE RATING BUDGET
If you’re designing a raid scenario for D&D, you generally want
to do the following:
Have the total XP of all active forces in the raid equal at least
three times the budget for a Deadly encounter.
Divide that XP budget into a larger number of Medium or
Easy action groups, rather than Hard or Deadly action
groups.

Due to the dynamic flow and active response of a typical raid
scenario, it will be very common for multiple action groups to
flow together into larger encounters or arrive in the middle of

an encounter as reinforcements. You want the flexibility to
have two, three, or maybe even four of these action groups join
together into a larger tactical action without simply curb
stomping the PCs.
At the same time, if there isn’t enough total opposition at
raid location, the optimal strategy will be to simply let all
bad guys run to your position and wipe them out in one
encounter. Which is boring, particularly if it becomes
default for every raid scenario.

the
the
big
the

The sweet spot is for the PCs to (a) potentially be able to take
out isolated bad guys fast enough that the alarm doesn’t get
raised (i.e., Easy encounters); (b) be able to deal with armed
conflict when it does break out (i.e., stand up to several action
groups attacking at once); and at the same time (c) not
trivialize the raid (i.e., not defeat everybody in one big fight).
This advice can be generalized to other RPGs: Identify the
toughest encounter the PCs can handle in the system, then
triple the strength of that encounter to determine the minimum
force profile for the raid location.
Learning about each element will be either
trivial,

challenging, or
impossible.

In a typical raid scenario, most of the elements will be trivial to
survey. This is the foundation of the scenario, providing the
fundamental knowledge of the tactical arena that will allow the
players to create their tactical plan. Trivial surveys are often
essentially automatic: As the PCs approach the raid location, you
might simply draw the outline of the building while describing it to

them, along with the doors, windows, and guards they can see. In
some cases, though, completing the trivial survey may require some
minor but deliberate effort by the PCs—e.g., needing to walk around
a building to see the back door in the alley or keeping the fortress
under surveillance for at least 20 minutes to notice the guard patrol.
A challenging element, on the other hand, requires some extra
effort by the PCs to survey. This might be a clever action or a skill
check, but it doesn’t have to be terribly elaborate or onerous. “Can I
find some high ground nearby or maybe climb a tree to look down
into the compound?” is a good example, as is, “Do I recognize the
electronic locks? Maybe there’s a manufacturer’s override code we
could use.” This can also include reactive skill checks for stuff that
the PCs might notice during a trivial survey, but which require
particular knowledge or sharp perception.
Finally, there may be some elements that are impossible for the
PCs to survey before breaching the location. For example, it’s hard
to imagine how a typical group would be able to figure out the
precise layout of a sub-basement by looking at a building from
outside. (Of course, you never know how you might be surprised by
player ingenuity during actual play.)
Impossible and even challenging elements are not required for a
raid scenario to work, but the enigmas they present can play merry
havoc with the PCs’ plans. On the other hand, if the players figure
out how to rip away the engima from a challenging element before
the raid begins, they’ll enjoy being rewarded with the advantage of
their hard-won knowledge.
Special abilities or technology can make the impossible
challenging or even trivial. Can a PC see through walls? Do they
have access to a drone, a clairvoyance spell, or a gem of seeing? These
are all great resources to have for a raid scenario! They allow you to
design more complex and intricate raid locations while still being
able to provide a comprehensive survey to the PCs.
Even when the PCs learn about an element, of course, that
element may still have undiscovered secrets. For example, they can

spot a patrol without knowing its exact movements or see a door
with an electronic lock without knowing the code to open it.
A particularly useful version of this is that it’s possible for the PCs
to know that a room exists while having no idea what’s inside it. For
example, if they look through a window and see a closed door, they
don’t need to know exactly what’s on the other side to intuit that
there’s a room there. You get the same effect with windows on the
outside of the building that they don’t look through, and the players
can even draw similar inferences about the presence of a room by
noting that there’s a space on the floorplans they can’t account for.
FAMILIAR RAIDS
If a raid takes place in a location the PCs are already familiar
with, then the “survey” is actually just their memories of the
place (although additional observation may be required for
active forces or recent alterations). For example, the PCs might
return home to find that goblin shadowstalkers have taken
hostages in the inn where they’ve been staying.
This familiarity can also be outsourced to an NPC for a similar
effect. For example, the patron hiring them for a job may be
able to provide them the intel they need to plan their raid.
If the PCs are doing actual legwork to pull together information
like this, though, you’re probably crossing the line into a heist
(see here).
You also want to be aware of survey risks. The most basic of
these is pretty simple: What if the bad guys notice the PCs staking
out their location?
This common risk is likely resolved with some kind of Stealthtype test. If the PCs are noticed, then the bad guys might shoo them
away (preventing a more detailed survey), immediately attack them,

and/or increase their security. (Their actual choice will depend on
both the scenario and the specific circumstances.)
Other survey risks are, of course, also possible, and will often be
tied to particular actions taken to reveal challenging survey
elements. For example, the PCs might trigger a booby trap or simply
fall and injure themselves while trying to climb up to some vantage
point.

RUNNING THE RAID
Although very similar to running a dungeon scenario, running a
successful raid poses some unique challenges. Before you get started
with your first scenario, therefore, we’re going to dive into a few
new techniques for making rulings that are particularly useful
during a raid, and then we’ll lay out a procedure for managing raid
turns that will help keep your scenario on track.

INTRODUCING THE RAID

One of the potential pitfalls of running your first raid scenario is
their similarity to other location-based adventures. Players who
have only experienced dungeon scenarios will see the raid location
and, without knowing that raids are an option, simply default to
treating the scenario as if it were a dungeon. This won’t necessarily
render the scenario unplayable, but it’s very likely to become a
suboptimal or even deeply frustrating experience for them.
What you need to do, obviously, is introduce your players to the
concept of a raid scenario as part of their first raid scenario. The key
thing, in my experience, is to make sure that the survey happens.
Once the players have a floorplan and details of a location’s

defenses in hand, it takes only a minor amount of survival instinct
for them to use that information to their advantage by forming a
plan of action.
One option is to use the PCs’ patron. In other words, whoever
hires them to do the job can give them suggestions or even explicit
directions on how the job should be done. (“The target has highly
responsive security, so you’ll probably want to get in and out as
quickly as possible.”) Some mission objectives, like planting a
listening device or assassinating a target with no collateral damage,
can more or less mandate the job be approached as a raid. Such
patrons can even perform the survey for the PCs, providing a
briefing packet that includes blueprints and security details.
Another option is to design their first raid scenario so that it
features an ultra-trivial survey. Basically, as soon as the PCs
approach the location, you just automatically provide them with a
complete set of blueprints and a bunch of obvious security details.
(“The entrances are here and here. You can see security guards here,
here, and here. Looking through this window on the second floor
you can see that Rodríguez is working in her office.”)
You can also use equipment loadout as a gentle prompt to
encourage raid-style play. The scenario’s patron could, once again,
provide this equipment or you might just stock the appropriate
treasure hordes with it. In a science fiction game, for example, if
you give the PCs access to T-ray goggles that can look through
walls, knockout gas, and a missile launcher with one shot before
pointing them toward a heavily armored compound on Ganymede,
they might figure it out all by themselves.
Of course, you can also just tell the players that the scenario is
designed for a raid-style approach and what that entails (surveying
the target, putting together a tactical plan, and then successfully
executing it). This blunt approach may prove alienating for some
players, who will resent having the GM “force” them to do
something, but as long as you don’t make a habit of it, there’s a lot
to be said for open, clear communication at the gaming table.

The great thing is that once the players have added raiding to
their tool kit, they’ll naturally start looking for opportunities to
perform a raid. They may even surprise you by approaching future
dungeon scenarios using raid-style techniques. The difference
between a dungeon scenario and a raid scenario is often almost
entirely about how the PCs choose to tactically approach the
scenario, and as the PCs add additional tools to their repertoire,
you’ll actually find all of your scenarios being enriched as a result.

FAILING FORWARD

When making rulings, we often default to simple binary outcomes:
You either pick the lock or you don’t. You climb the wall or you fall.
You hit the orc with your sword or you miss. You either succeed on
the check or you fail.
Failing forward is an alternative technique in which the
mechanical result of failure (e.g., rolling below the target number) is
described as being a success-with-complications in the game world.
When we first discussed making checks (way back on page 28),
we talked about making failure meaningful by disallowing retries. A
simple rule of thumb for when you should use failing forward is
whenever disallowing a retry feels a little weird to you: Why can’t
the PC just try to pick the lock again?
In our foundational technique, the intended path fails and the PCs
need to find an alternative path. Failing forward is a different way
of making failure meaningful because you don’t annihilate the
intended route (whether you prepped it or the players chose it). You
just complicate it.
Coming up with interesting complications on the fly, though, can
feel intimidating. So, when in doubt, just impose a cost: You
succeed, but …
You have to pay extra.
You took damage.

Your equipment broke.

It took extra time (if that’s relevant).

Someone knows you did it whom you didn’t want to inform.
If you have an idea for a better complication, great. But if not,
these five broad categories can cover like 90 percent of fail forward
checks. In fact, you’ll usually have multiple options. When picking a
lock, for example:
You open the door but trigger the security trap. (You take
damage.)

You open the door, but your lock pick snapped off in the lock.
(Your equipment broke.)

You open the door, but it took 20 minutes and now you only
have 10 minutes before the Count returns home. (It took extra
time and that was relevant.)

If none of these options seem to work and you can’t think of
something outside of the box, that’s fine: Either don’t make the
check in the first place (just let them automatically succeed) or
default back to No Retries Allowed and move forward in a different
way.
OFFER COST
Instead of just imposing the cost of a failed fail forward check, you
can get a little fancy by offering that cost to the player and allowing
them to choose between paying the cost or failing the check. For
example, “You’ve almost got the safe open, but the hacked security
camera is going to come back online. Do you stay and open the door
or GTFO before the camera spots you?” or “Damien agrees to do it,
but he wants an extra 500 gold pieces.”
Failing forward is particularly useful when running raid scenarios
for a couple reasons.

First, it allows tactical plans to survive contact with the enemy …
or, more accurately, survive contact with a bad dice roll. If the
players spend time making a tactical plan that starts by breaching
the back door of the compound, having the whole plan fall apart
because their skill check to open the door failed probably isn’t the
best option. It would be more interesting if, for example, forcing the
door damaged the lock in such a way that the next security patrol
passing this way would be alerted to the intruders.
On that note, the second reason failing forward works well during
raids is that the presence of active security forces provides a rich
source for complications. Any fallout from a failed check that alerts
security immediately makes the raid more interesting, and lost time
is always relevant in a raid.
SIMPLE SUCCESS CHECK
A simple success check is kind of the opposite of a fail forward
check. It’s typically used in situations where the characters are
skilled professionals doing a routine task and, therefore, there’s
no meaningful chance of failure. In most cases, of course, we’d
default to yes and the character would automatically succeed,
but sometimes success can be assured while still leaving
uncertain exactly how good the outcome will be. In other
words, success is simple, but we make a check to see if the
character excels and achieves a higher-quality result.
So for a fail forward check, a mechanical success indicates the
character has achieved their desired goal and a mechanical
failure indicates they’ve done so, but only with a complication.
In a simple success check, on the other hand, a mechanical
failure means the character achieved their desired goal (they
succeeded) and a mechanical success indicates they’ve gained
an extraordinary success or boon.

LET IT RIDE

Something you want to avoid as a GM is rolling to failure. This is
when a PC attempts to accomplish something, but a successful check
doesn’t actually let them do it. Instead, a successful roll—for
whatever reason—just results in them making another check. This
then repeats until the player rolls a failure, at which point the
attempt fails.
It sounds a little crazy when you just describe it like that, but it’s
a surprisingly easy trap to fall into.
For example, it often occurs when the PCs are trying to use
stealth. GMs will have the PCs roll a new Stealth check every single
time they move or every single time they encounter a new
opponent. Even if a PC has a 75% chance of success on their first
Stealth check, after just three checks their chance of success will
have dropped to 42%. After five checks, it’s dropped to 24%. And
the first time they fail a check, of course, their attempt at stealth is
over as their enemies raise the alarm.
Under these circumstances, of course, failure becomes more or
less assured and the players will simply stop trying to be stealthy.
Seeing a broad swath of awesome experiences get summarily junked
from your campaign kinda sucks, and it’s particularly unfortunate
for raids because a lack of stealth-based options will really flatten
those scenarios.
The solution is to let it ride.
When the PCs set a specific goal for themselves, make a single
check and let the result of that check ride forward: If they’re trying
to climb a cliff, make a single Athletics check to determine whether
they get to the top (even if it would take them several rounds or
minutes or hours to do so). If the intention is to “sneak through the
enemy base,” then you make one Stealth check for the entire op and
it determines how stealthy they’re going to be for the whole thing.
(And the answer may be, “Not very stealthy, so someone is probably
going to spot you.” And that’s okay.)

This doesn’t mean, however, that you roll the dice and then
immediately skip to the end. The cool thing about letting a skill
check ride is that other actions and choices can intersect with the
attempt.
HEATHER (LAEVRA): Okay, I’m going to slip inside and gently
ease the door closed behind me.
JASON (GM): Give me a Dexterity (Stealth) check.
HEATHER (LAEVRA): 17.

Jason notes that no one inside the building heard the door open.
JASON (GM): You’re in a back hallway. To your left there are a
number of doors. To your right the hall leads to a stairway
heading up to the second floor.
HEATHER (LAEVRA): I’ll check out the stairs.
JASON (GM): Give me a Wisdom (Perception) check.
HEATHER (LAEVRA): 14.

JASON (GM): You notice that there’s a security camera positioned
to film anyone coming up the stairs.
HEATHER (LAEVRA): Is there any way to avoid it?

Jason knows that the camera is rated at DC 21, so Laevra’s riding
Dexterity (Stealth) check of 17 will fail if she tries to sneak past
it. She doesn’t know that, of course.
JASON (GM): You might be able to slide under the camera and
avoid its field of view.
HEATHER (LAEVRA): Hmm. It’s too risky. I’ll turn around and
head back the other way.
JASON (GM): (rolls some dice) As you head back down the hall,
one of the doors ahead of you suddenly opens, but you manage
to quickly duck into a broom closet and out of sight. Looking

through a crack in the door, you see two security guards emerge
and start walking in the opposite direction.
Jason rolled a random encounter and then a Wisdom (Perception)
check for the guards. He got a 13 on the check, which was lower
than Laevra’s riding Dexterity (Stealth) check of 17, so she easily
hides from the guards.
As you can see in this example, these choices can have an impact
on the success or failure of the riding check. For example, if Laevra
had attempted to sneak past the security camera, she would have
been noticed and the alarm raised. Her choice not to do that
preserved the infiltration.
It’s also possible, while riding a check, to seek bonuses. For
example, if Laevra sneaks into the locker room and steals a guard’s
uniform, she could make a Charisma (Deception) check to disguise
herself. Jason might then give a +2 bonus to her riding Dexterity
(Stealth) total until someone sees through her disguise. The
Charisma (Deception) check, of course, would also be a riding
check.
Similarly, certain actions or outcomes could apply penalties to
the initial check result. For example, after Laevra frees the prisoner
she came to liberate, Jason might apply a -4 penalty to her riding
check result to reflect the additional difficulty of shepherding the
prisoner on their way back out of the complex.
So how does a ride end? Obviously you don’t just make a single
Dexterity (Stealth) check and then live with it forever. Broadly
speaking, there are four possibilities:
Success
Failure

Change of Approach

Change of Circumstance

Success mostly speaks for itself. If the PC accomplishes their goal
—they sneak into Rodríguez’s private office; they reach the summit
of the mountain; they negotiate the peace treaty with Ostranya—
then the ride comes to an end in triumph.
Failure is also fairly obvious. If you’re riding a check and hit a
point where the check fails, then that ride is over. This is
straightforward if the riding check is being compared to opposed
checks from NPCs, since the ride simply continues until one of those
NPCs rolls high enough (if they ever do).
If the riding check is being compared to static DCs, on the other
hand, it can get a little trickier. For example, if all the security
cameras in the building have the same DC and Laevra rolls high
enough, does that mean she just “automatically” bypasses all the
cameras? Quite possibly, yes, although we need to quibble on
calling it “automatic”: It wasn’t automatic. She succeeded on her
check. She was skilled enough that the security cameras weren’t a
challenge for her. This does, however, suggest that it’s important to
have multiple security measures (with, among other things, different
DCs and different consequences) and give Laevra meaningful choice
in navigating her way through those paths, and this is a lesson that
can be generalized to other riding checks. (For example, if the PCs
are climbing a mountain, the riding Strength [Athletics] check only
becomes relevant if (a) the DCs are escalating, (b) there are multiple
paths with some promised advantage for taking riskier paths, and/or
(c) other events or opportunities interrupt the journey.)
If you’d prefer to reintroduce some randomness, though, you can
convert the static DCs into random ones. (In D&D, you can do this
by subtracting 10 from the static DC and then adding 1d20.)
A change of approach happens when the PCs riding a check
abandon the strategy or actions covered by the check and do
something completely different. For example, if they decide it’s time
to stop sneaking around and instead noisily ambush a group of orcs.
Or they decide they’re running out of time and drink the potions of
flying they were saving rather than continue their climb. In some
circumstances, you may also decide that changing the focus of the

goal (“let’s sneak into his bedroom instead of his private office”) is
enough to warrant a new check.
A change of approach is not the same thing as an interruption,
however, which is when something unrelated to the goal being
attempted momentarily intrudes. For example, attacking orcs ends a
riding Dexterity (Stealth) check because it means the PCs are no
longer sneaking (and if they choose to go back to sneaking after the
fight, it’s time for a new check). On the other hand, attacking a tribe
of yetis on the side of the mountain probably doesn’t end the
Strength (Athletics) check for the ascent because the fight is merely
interrupting the climb, not abandoning it.
Finally, a change of circumstance means that something in the
environment has significantly shifted. This involves a judgment call
because, technically, you could argue that each individual guard is a
different circumstance and you should make a new check! (Which
would, obviously, negate the whole concept of letting it ride.)
What you’re looking for is something radical enough that it
fundamentally alters the nature of what the PCs are doing. For
example, if the PCs are sneaking through an orc camp at night and a
group of fire giants suddenly attack, you might decide that “middle
of a battlefield filled with flame” is so sufficiently different from
“sleepy orc camp in the dark” that a new check is called for.
Alternatively, maybe the PCs are sneaking through the orc camp,
discover a transdimensional portal in the shaman’s tent, and jump
through it into the Feywild. They can keep sneaking, but things
have changed enough that it’s probably time for a new check.
POINT OF UNCERTAINTY
When a riding check would fail, you can instead choose to create a
point of uncertainty. This is the moment at which the riding check
is at risk, but the character has an opportunity to save the result by
taking some sort of action. This lets you add complications while the
overall resolution continues pushing forward.
For example, Laevra is searching an office when a security guard
approaches. The guard’s Wisdom (Perception) check is higher than

her riding Dexterity (Stealth) check, so she’s at risk of being
discovered. The GM could simply have the guard slam open the
door and shout, “Freeze!” ending Laevra’s check.
But the GM could instead say, “Someone’s approaching the office
door. You can see the beam of a security guard’s flashlight waving
around through the frosted glass.”
Laevra now has the opportunity to do the following:
Leap out the window and hang from the side of the building while
the guard sweeps the room. (A Strength [Athletics] check.)
Ambush the approaching guard and hope she can take him out
before he can raise the alarm. (Resolved through combat.)
Bluff the guard into believing she’s authorized to be there. (A
Charisma [Persuasion] check.)

Drink a potion of invisibility. (Using equipment, which in this case
the GM might rule gives her a bonus to her riding check … which
may or may not be enough to avoid the guard’s notice.)
The key thing is that the response to a point of uncertainty should
generally not be “make the same skill check again.” If Laevra’s
Dexterity (Stealth) check is at risk, her response can’t just be “I hide
harder” while making another Dexterity (Stealth) check. You might
make an exception if Laevra comes up with a particularly clever
idea specific to her current situation, but what’s really required is
some out-of-the-box thinking.
ENDURANCE TESTS
Sometimes rolling to failure IS the goal. These are situations
where an eventual failure is guaranteed and the question is not
whether a character can succeed, but rather how long they can
succeed before the failure happens. Imagine someone trying to
stay afloat in stormy waters or holding a door shut while
monsters try to batter it down from the far side.

Having the character roll once per round (or hour or whatever
period of time is appropriate) until they fail can be a very good
fit for these types of endurance tests.

THEATER OF OPERATIONS

When you ran your first dungeon scenario, the encounters were
keyed to specific rooms: As the PCs entered Area 15, you checked
the key and saw that (a) it was a Cryptic Library and (b) there was a
cloaker hiding on the ceiling.
When a fight breaks out in the library, you’ve learned to make
combat encounters memorable by leveraging the environment, so
bookshelves topple over on top of people and maybe the injured
cloaker retreats back up to the ceiling and starts throwing books.
But the cloaker is keyed to Area 15, so that’s where the cloaker is
met and that’s where the fight happens.
As you became more confident as a GM, though, you started
looking beyond the current room. When the PCs start fighting the
cloaker, you look around the map and use your adversary roster to
check nearby areas to see if there are any other monsters who might
come join the fight. Over in Area 17 you notice a barracks with five
goblin blood warriors and make a check to see if they hear the fight.
They succeed on the check, and so a couple rounds later they come
rushing over and join the melee in the library!
Tools like adversary rosters and random encounter checks also
mean that combat encounters are no longer limited to specific,
predetermined areas. They can happen in any room! Maybe the PCs
are poking around the orrery in the observatory in Area 30 when a
gloomcaster stumbles across them or they’re checking out the
armory in Area 18 when a group of shadowstalkers arrives to equip
themselves.

At this point you’ve accomplished a lot. Your dungeons are no
longer static complexes filled with monsters who patiently wait for
the PCs to show up and slaughter them. They feel like living,
dynamic spaces that respond to what the PCs are doing.
But many GMs who reach this point still have one preconception
that they’re clinging to. When the goblins came rushing over to join
the fight in the library? It was still the fight in the library. When the
gloomcaster discovered the PCs in the observatory? Many GMs will
still be thinking of that fight as somehow “belonging” to Area 30.
One of the reasons this happens is because our method of
mapping and keying a dungeon is designed to do it: We conceptually
break the map into discrete chunks and then number each chunk
specifically to firewall each section of the dungeon. As we’ve seen, it
makes it easier to describe the dungeon and it makes it easier to run
the dungeon, allowing the GM to focus on the current “chunk”
without being overwhelmed by the totality.
But the next step is to go through that abstraction and come out
the other side. We don’t want to abandon the advantages of
conceptually “chunking” the dungeon, but we also don’t want to be
constrained by it. We want clearly defined rooms that we can easily
pick up and play with, but in actual play we want to recognize that
each room is just one part of an interconnected location.
It’s a little bit like juggling. You may start out by just having one
room in play, but as you become more skilled you’ll want to learn
how to keep several of them in play at the same time. For example,
check out the map on the previous page and consider our Cryptic
Library in Area 15.
If you’re only playing with Area 15, then characters can leap up
onto the table and you can even have the reinforcements from Area
17 show up in the doorway. But when you can take one step back
and start thinking of the dungeon as a theater of operations, then
you’ll see stuff like this:
A character getting thrown through the bay windows into the
garden in Area 15.

A PC slipping across the hall into Area 19 so that they can pincer
the blood warrior reinforcements in the hall.

One of the blood warriors breaking off and shouting in goblin,
“I’ll get Orok and the troll!”

The ranger activating her boots of speed, cutting through Area 14,
and racing around to cut the goblin off in Area 12.

The goblins in the rear simultaneously circling through Area 16 to
try to mount an assault on the PCs’ flank.
Other goblins moving down the hall to the windows, and then
shooting through Area 13 into the library.

The best part is that, as you introduce moments like this, you’ll
also be opening the door to your players to start doing the same
thing. They’ll start engaging in strategic decision-making not only in
combat (“Let’s fall back into the hallway!”), but also for the
exploration and engagement of the dungeon as a whole (“Can we
draw them back into the room with the poison traps and use those
to our advantage? Can we circle around them? Can we split them
up?”). These kinds of actions, which can turn an entire complex into
a playground, are particularly valuable in creating dynamic, exciting
raid scenarios, whether you’re in a combat situation or just trying to
avoid one.
Make no mistake: This is hard to do! But it’s a skill that can be
learned and practiced.
Before you begin working on the theater of operations, make sure
to get completely comfortable running just one room. Just like a
juggler, you’re going to want to be confident in throwing one ball
before you try to keep a bunch of them in the air all at once. That’s
the bedrock everything else is built on.
When you’re ready to take the next step, start with hallways—the
spaces between the rooms. When the PCs are standing in a room,
just keep the hallway(s) immediately outside the room in mind.
Think of them as spaces where characters are standing in your
mental picture of the scene. If a fight breaks out, include them—and

the chokepoints formed by the doorways leading to them—in the
tactical choices being made.
If you’re using some form of a battlemap, make a point of
including the hallways in addition to the PCs’ current room. This
can be relatively easy if you’re using a virtual tabletop, since the
whole map is usually accessible on the computer screen. If you’re
using an erasable mat, printing out the map, or building 3D terrain,
though, just make sure to take the extra effort.
If you’re using theater of the mind, on the other hand, simply
make a point of not framing your scenes to the door. You can use
random encounter distance (see here) to vary the engagement point
and push yourself out of your comfort zone. Importantly, this is true
whether the PCs are approaching a room or the PCs are in a room
that’s being approached by an action group.
BREACHING THE DOOR
Even though you’re often pushing the initial engagement point out of
the room, this doesn’t mean that every fight should have the bad
guys rush out the door to fight the PCs in the hall. Think about
who’s aware of who; think about preparation vs. rushing in vs.
withdrawing vs. sending help vs. going out the back door and
encircling them vs. any number of other possibilities. Expanding
your scope should result in more variety, not less.
Once you start getting a feel for the options offered by the
hallway, it’s time to think about neighboring rooms. You can start
by just looking at the ring of rooms that are just one room away
from the current area. For example, if we’re in the Cryptic Library
(Area 15), that would include Areas 13, 14, 16, and 19. I think of
these rooms as lying within the current “penumbra” of the action.
Using an adversary roster (see here) will continue to help you
here. Even though you’re looking at multiple rooms simultaneously,
the individual rooms remain firewalled: The active elements (i.e.,
the denizens) are still summarized on and can be run from the

adversary roster. This means you don’t need to dive deep into every
detail of every room key to manage the theater of operations. You
only need a very broad, high-level understanding of the room’s
concept (which is often summarized in the room’s name), and can
use that to choose the moments when you need to do a deeper dive.
As you get more comfortable juggling rooms, you can slowly
expand the size of this penumbra as needed. In practice, though, I
find that you rarely need to push more than a couple rooms away
from the current area. (For the Cryptic Library, that would mean
adding Areas 12, 17, 18, 22, and 23.)
THE ROOM LIST
Because the name of the room is often all the context you need to
effectively manage the theater of operations, you may find it useful
to keep a separate list of the room names for easy reference. In fact,
you might include that list right on the map or on the same page as
your adversary roster for easy access.
A slightly more complicated methodology than the ring of rooms
is to use line of sight. More specifically, if the PCs can currently see
a door leading to a room, you should add that room to your
penumbra.
I find the utility of this method to be very situational, but it can
be particularly useful in hallways. For example, if the PCs are
standing in the hallway outside of Area 15 (instead of inside the
Cryptic Library), then using line of sight would suggest that the
rooms you need to care about at the moment are Areas 12, 15, 16,
17, 18, and 19.
As you can see, there’s not “one true list” of rooms for you to keep
track of. It’s more about developing an adaptable situational
awareness of which rooms are significant in a particular moment,
and learning a slightly different way of looking at a scenario map
that allows you to play the totality of the environment almost as if it
were a gameboard.

What you don’t want to do is start trying to prep specific “theaters
of operations” in your scenarios. Not only will you end up wasting a
lot of prep, but you’re probably just creating another inflexible
preconception of the environment. The true theater of operations
arises out of and is defined by the circumstances of play: What do
the PCs know? Where do they go? How have they tipped off the
NPCs? What decisions do the NPCs make (often based on imperfect
information)?
The point isn’t to try to anticipate all of those things. The point is
to learn how to actively play the campaign world and to let the
campaign world live in the moment.
OTHER THEATERS OF OPERATIONS
Think about your house. Imagine standing in the kitchen and talking
to someone in the living room. Or shouting something down the
stairs. Or looking up from the couch and seeing what’s happening in
the next room.
When we’re talking about the totality of the environment, that’s
all we’re talking about. It’s that simple, and it can be found in even
the most intimate of spaces.
On the other end of the scale, there are wilderness environments.
(You can read more about them in Part 5, starting on page 363.)
The sheer scale of the wilderness can, paradoxically, cause the
theater of operations to collapse into a one-dimensional scope: The
forest is vast and, therefore, an entire fight just happens generically
“in the forest.” There’s no place for reinforcements to come from
and no capacity for strategic decisions because everything is,
conceptually, in a single place—a “forest” that’s functionally a haze
of trees.
The use of tabletop battlemaps locked to a 5-foot scale can
exacerbate this one-dimensionality, limiting the field of battle to a
scale that tends to blot out the true theater of operations in the
wilderness.
The solution is to instead embrace the scale of the wilderness.
You’re traveling across the plains, but there’s a tree line a few

hundred yards to the north. There’s a family of deer grazing 50 feet
over there. There’s a ravine to your right perhaps a quarter of a mile
away that you’ve been paralleling for a while now. And the goblin
worg riders just cleared the horizon behind you.
What do you do?

THE RAID TURN

A raid turn is, unsurprisingly, very similar to the dungeon turn (see
here).
1. Mark ticks.
2. Make an activation check.
3. Declare actions.
4. Resolve adversary actions.
5. Make Perception-type checks as necessary.
6. Resolve actions, including tracking movement on the map.
Whereas a dungeon turn is 10 minutes long, however, a raid turn
is only 1 minute long. During a raid scenario, the focus isn’t on
exploration, so our time scale shifts to reflect the fast-paced tactical
focus of the PCs (and also the bad guys who are potentially hunting
them).

RAID ACTIONS

Raid actions are generally equivalent to dungeon actions (see here),
but the shorter duration of the raid turn means that some actions
are modified.
Movement is usually done at raid pace, which is equal to a
character’s speed. (This assumes that they are moving cautiously,
but with tactical purpose.) Characters can move at combat pace,
which is equal to speed x 10 per raid turn, but they suffer
disadvantage on Perception and Stealth checks.

Ritual casting, which takes 10 minutes, obviously can’t be
completed in a single raid turn and must instead be done over the
course of several raid turns.
Searching, similarly, cannot cover as much area during a raid
turn and will require the PCs to be much more focused in targeting
their searches. A character can generally search two 5-foot squares
(or 50 sq. ft.) as a raid action. This does mean that thoroughly
searching a room will chew up a lot of relevant time in a raid
scenario, and during those turns the active adversaries will be
hunting the PCs.

RAID PERCEPTION

The trick to running an exciting raid scenario without becoming
overwhelmed by the potential complexity is efficiently managing
the action groups on your adversary roster in a structured way. It’s
also important to do this in a fair and fun way: If all of your action
groups omnisciently know what the PCs are doing (because as the
GM, of course, you know it) and immediately swarm them, that’s
neither fun nor fair. In a raid scenario it’s more important than ever
that you actually roleplay your action groups: Step into their shoes,
think about what they know and who they are and what their
priorities are, and then have them act accordingly.
On the other hand, telling you to “just roleplay everyone in the
building!” would be ridiculous. There’s gotta be a better way.
The better way I recommend is the Triple-A procedure:
Active
Alert

Aware
To better understand these three categories, let’s first think about
the “default” action group that is currently located in a specific area
of your map. This stationary action group is neither active, alert, nor
aware.

An active action group is one that’s taking raid actions, usually
moving from one location to another: She leaves the party, she goes
to the lab, she gets some dinner, etc.
An alert action group is one that knows the PCs (or some form of
threat) is present in the location and are taking actions accordingly.
(That might be hunting for the PCs, alerting other action groups,
moving a VIP to a secure location, setting up barricades, or
whatever action seems appropriate to the situation.)
An aware action group knows where the PCs are, either precisely
or, at least, to some actionable level of precision (e.g., “I heard
someone moving around downstairs”). This might be due to line of
sight, security cameras, noise, clairvoyance spells, etc.
For most purposes, these act as a hierarchy: An alert character is
likely to be active, and an aware character will be both alert and
active. This mean that you can track the status of each action group
on your adversary roster with a single symbol, for example
. An
active group would have one
while an aware group would have
three
.
When it’s time to resolve adversary actions, this will allow you to
quickly scan down your adversary roster and instantly identify
which action groups need to have their actions resolved.
The way an action group actually becomes alert or aware, of
course, is through Perception-type checks. These checks should be
more difficult, of course, the farther away an action group is from
the PCs. Some RPGs will include guidelines for this sort of thing, but
if I need to create a rule of thumb I like to simply count rooms. For
example, in D&D:
If the source is on the far side of a wall or door, the Perceptiontype check is made at disadvantage.
Apply a cumulative -2 penalty to the Perception-type check for
each additional room between them and the source.

If we take a look back at our sample raid map on page 289, for
example, if the PCs were making a bunch of noise in the Area 13

gardens and there was an action group in Area 17, I would quickly
count the rooms between them (Area 15, Area 16) and then make
the Wisdom (Perception) check with disadvantage and at a -4
penalty. (Or you could use the rules for passive Perception at a -9: a
-4 penalty for the room count and a -5 penalty for disadvantage.)
Make sure you don’t make a lot of noise in a hallway, because
that’s directly adjacent to a bunch of different rooms!
You could alternatively base your rule of thumb on linear distance
(e.g., a -1 penalty for every 50 feet of distance) if you find that more
intuitive than room counts.
As you’re making Perception-type checks for the bad guys, keep in
mind that the target of the check might not be the PCs: It can also
be evidence. For example, if the PCs kicked down a door or blacked
out a security camera or tossed an office while looking for the jade
idol, those are all things that enemy action groups may notice.
DUNGEON TURNS VS. RAID TURNS VS. COMBAT ROUNDS
If you’re running a raid where the PCs are carefully exploring a
compound and the bad guys haven’t been alerted yet, you
might want to start out using dungeon turns and then swap to
the faster pace of raid turns once the action starts heating up.
You might do the opposite, too: If you’re running a dungeon
scenario and the PCs have stirred up a hornet’s nest of enemies
on high alert, it could be useful to swap to raid turns.
If it seems like things are happening too fast for the raid turn to
handle it, you also have a third option: Drop into combat
rounds.
Remember that these are all tools: Use whichever one is most
useful for the situation you’re currently resolving.

PERCEPTION ON THE ROSTER
Putting the Perception modifier or passive Perception score of an
action group on the adversary roster can be very useful in raid
scenarios!

WHAT DO THE BAD GUYS ACTUALLY DO?
What the opposition in a raid scenario does is highly dependent
on the specific situation, so a comprehensive answer to this
question isn’t really possible. But here are some things you can
quickly default to if you don’t have a better idea.
If an action group is directly engaged with the PCs (i.e., they
can see the PCs), they’ll either
attack; or

run away.
If an action group is alert, they’ll either
look for the intruders (i.e., pick a direction and have them
move one room over); or
go for help (i.e., alert nearby action groups).

RAID ACTIVATION

Within the raid turn procedure, there are three ways for a currently
passive action group to become active. (But the procedure isn’t
everything. You can just arbitrarily decide to activate an NPC
because it feels like the right thing to do in the moment.)
First, patrols begin the scenario activated. (They’re basically
defined as action groups that are moving around the map.)
Second, you may choose to activate an action group as a
complication in response to a player failing an action check while
using fail forward techniques. (“Oh no! Lady Sablehawk is heading
our way!”)
Third, they activate on a successful activation check.
Broadly speaking, there are two ways you can resolve activation
checks, and you’ll want to choose the one that you prefer or works
best for the current scenario.
The method that’s usually simpler is a site activation check.
Make a single 1d6 roll. On a result of 1, pick one random action
group and activate it.
The other alternative is a group activation check. Roll 1d12 for
each passive action group. On a result of 1, that action group is
activated. (This method obviously allows multiple groups to activate
simultaneously, which can be much more complicated to run.) If
you have a lot of action groups, it’s usually easiest to roll for all of
them at the same time.
In practice, you’ll also want to periodically deactivate groups. In
other words, an active group arrives in a new location and then
stops moving. You can often do this based on the perceived goal of
the action group being accomplished. For example, if a scientist
activates and leaves their lab to go to their private quarters, then
when they arrive at their quarters they’ll probably deactivate.
If you’d prefer a procedural method, you can also make a site
deactivation check or make a group deactivation check for each
currently active group. This might include deactivating patrols (who

could be taking a break) or even alert action groups (who might be
giving up the search or simply bunkering down).

ALARM CASCADES
A phenomenon that can occur in a raid scenario is the alarm
cascade: One action group becomes alert or aware of the PCs
and they alert another action group (or set of action groups).
Then those action groups alert another set and the situation
cascades until every single action group in the scenario has
been activated.
This isn’t necessarily a bad thing. It’s actually quite logical for
security forces to respond like this. (“Sound the alarm!
Intruders on Deck Six!”) But it can be useful to keep a few
things in mind.
First, it can be more effective if the PCs are given an
opportunity to prevent it from happening (i.e., shooting the
terrorist before he can use his walkie-talkie to alert the others).
Second, even if it’s an alarm cascade, it usually doesn’t happen
all at once: It might involve shouting at a distance (in which
case Perception-type checks would be called for). Or it might
require movement. After movement, the action groups need to
actually interact with each other to pass along information. All
of those are likely raid actions, during which the PCs can also
be taking actions.

Third, information can rapidly become obsolete in a raid
scenario. (Patrol Team A thinks the PCs are on Level 4, but
they’ve actually split up and are on both Levels 5 and 6 now.) If
the PCs take an action that could throw the hounds off their
scent, roll with it and let the bad guys spread out as they try to
track the PCs down again.

HOMEWORK
EXECUTE A RAID
In order to run a raid, you need to prep a few straightforward tools:
Floorplan (entries, rooms, objective)

Defenses (passive obstacles and active forces)

Blueprint (depicting the results of a trivial survey, to which
additional information can be added)
The process for doing this will be very similar to how you design
your dungeons (see here):
Brainstorming
Mapping
Keying

Adversary Rosters and/or Random Encounters
As you’re doing this work, you’ll usually want to dial down the
number of featured rooms compared to a dungeon. Remember that

featured rooms are defined by having multiple elements for the PCs
to interact with and explore. A raid scenario, however, isn’t about
exploration. It’s still great to have cool discoveries and nifty details
in your scenic rooms, but during a raid the PCs will be much more
focused on tactically navigating the theater of operations. When you
do have a featured room, it’s quite likely that its primary focus will
be on defensive elements (traps, alarms, etc.).
Raids are a fantastic tool to have in your tool kit because, as
we’ve noted, any time the players say that they want something,
you can respond by simply putting the thing they want inside the
raid.
This also means that you may find it useful to whip out an
unplanned raid in the middle of a session when the PCs
unexpectedly go looking for something. This can be tricky, though,
because even with a lot of experience a raid can be difficult to
improvise. The biggest hurdle is usually the floorplan: It’s of vital
importance to a raid scenario, but very challenging to gin up on the
fly.

RANDOM FLOORPLANS

So we’ll start by rolling up a random floorplan, which can also be
useful in any number of other situations. (PCs have a terrible
propensity for deciding to duck into random buildings at the drop of
a hat.)
STEP 1: ROLL CORNER DICE
This is a table mat generator, which means that the position of the
dice you roll is part of the random generator. In this case, take a
handful of d4s and roll them onto a sheet of paper. Most buildings
are square, so you can just consider the edges of the paper to be the
outer walls of the building.
The location where each die lands is a corner with a number of
walls extending from that corner equal to the number rolled on the
die. The more dice you roll, the more complicated the interior of the
building will be (and complexity generally equates to size). For a

simple cottage, a single d4 would be sufficient. Below you can see
an example using 3d4.

If a die rolls outside the “walls” of your building, you can ignore
it, reroll it, or use it as an indicator of an irregularity in the
otherwise square profile of your building. Whatever works.
OPTION: STAIR DICE
You can roll a six-sided die as a d3 (1 or 2 = 1, 3 or 4 = 2, 5
or 6 = 3) in addition to the corner dice to determine the
number of floors in the building. If there are multiple floors,
where the stair die lands can be treated as the location of the
staircase if you’d like. If the raw number on the d6 is odd, then
the building has a basement (included in the total number of
floors). If it’s even, then the building does not.
OTHER STAIR DICE
You can increase the maximum number of floors, of course, by
increasing the size of the die used and interpreting the results
in the same way. (Rolling a d8 as a d4, a d10 as a d5, a d12 as
a d6, and so forth.)
Rolling 2d3-1 produces a nice bell curve for the number of
floors and a building with multiple stairs. (You can limit the
number of buildings with multiple stairs by including multiple
stairs only if the dice roll doubles, and otherwise placing the
stairs at whichever die rolled higher.)

Rolling 2d3-2 (minimum 1) produces the homes found in a
mid-twentieth-century American Midwest suburb if you assume
there’s always a basement when there’s more than one floor.
STEP 2: ADD DOORS & ENTRIES
After drawing your walls, you can remove the dice and add doors
and windows wherever it seems appropriate. For a raid, keep in
mind that you want at least two entries and that each entry should
be either secured, hidden, or both.
For example:

I placed the doors here while imagining a residence (with a short
entry hall leading from the front door and a master suite in the
upper left corner; you can fill in the other rooms easily). But we
could also imagine generating the same walls when we need a small
business and, therefore, making different decisions about the doors:

Here you can see how the same randomly generated walls can just
as easily give us a shop front with a door leading to a private
residence at the back of the building. The master suite remains in
the upper left, but here we find a bedroom with a large closet in the
lower right. (Or maybe your imagination might make that a kitchen
with an attached larder.)

STEP 3: PLACE THE OBJECTIVE
With your floorplan in place, you can now place your objective (or
objectives). I generally look for the locations that are farthest away
from the entrances so that the PCs need to scheme their way past
layers of security.
On the other hand, placing an objective directly behind a heavily
secured entrance can also be an effective variant: If you can bypass
the last trip wires, scale the wall of the château, disable the guards
on the balcony without raising the alarm, and open the door (which
is actually a mimic) … Congratulations! You’ve gained entrance to
Duke Endo’s study (and the vault hidden behind the painting of his
dead wife and daughter) without having to worry about the rest of
the château!

PRACTICING YOUR PREP

Of course, you don’t have to wait until the middle of a session to use
this random floorplan generator as the seed for a raid scenario. In
addition to using it as a resource while prepping any scenario, it can
also just be a fun exercise to roll up random floorplans and quickly
start sketching in what the resulting raid scenario might look like.

THE HEIST

A heist scenario is very similar to a raid but adds a layer of
complexity and opportunity in the form of legwork. Unlike in a
raid, where the PCs can quickly figure out the floorplan and
defensive measures through direct observation, in a heist
discovering these elements requires additional effort and planning.
Running a heist, therefore, consists of five phases:
1. Identify the Score
2. Gather Information
3. Onsite Surveillance
4. Prep Work
5. The Operation
INTRODUCING HEISTS
The heist structure is very player-driven, but if the players
haven’t done proper heists before, they may assume—due to its
similarity to location crawls—that they’re “supposed” to engage
the heist in the same way that they engage a typical dungeon
(by storming the door and stabbing everything in sight).
So the first few times you run heist scenarios, just like raid
scenarios, it may be a good idea to explicitly let the players
know that they have opportunities they might not normally
consider.
Once players get comfortable with heists being part of their
tool kit, though, things can start to get really interesting:
They’ll start using heist techniques even with location-based
scenarios you hadn’t specifically thought of as being heists!

PHASE 1: IDENTIFY THE SCORE

The heist is initiated when the players identify the objective. This
might be something that they want or it might be a job offered to
them by a patron.
What they’re trying to get, of course, is only half the equation.
Where is equally important. It’s possible they’ll learn both halves at
the same time (“I need you to steal the Frazelka Diamond from the
dwarven vault”), but some extra effort may be required (“Where are
we going to find an EMP device?!”).

PHASE 2: GATHER INFORMATION

The next step is for the PCs to gather information about their target.
This should include being able to gain access to some or all of the
blueprints and defenses of the targeted location. It may also
include an event schedule, which will often feature one or more
opportunities for performing the heist (by either providing unique
access to the target and/or providing cover for the operation).
Architectural and security details can potentially be found by the
following means:
Reconnaissance (similar to a raid survey)
Accessing public records

Hacking the database of a security company
Questioning current and former staff

And so forth.
In prepping the heist scenario, you should give some thought to
what form the Gather Information phase might take for the target,
but you should always remain open to alternative thinking from the
PCs. Remember that the expected outcome is for the PCs to succeed
in getting this information. That doesn’t mean it’s guaranteed: The
expected outcome of combat in an RPG is for the PCs to win, right?
But that doesn’t mean it always happens. The point is that you
shouldn’t get too enamored with keeping your cards close to your
chest here: 90 percent of the fun in a heist scenario comes from

seeing a problem and coming up with a solution for it. Only about
10 percent comes from being surprised by the unknown in the
middle of the heist (and that will usually arise organically as the
heist plays out).

PHASE 3: ONSITE SURVEILLANCE

After the initial gathering of information, most heist stories will give
the protagonists an opportunity to conduct onsite surveillance before
the heist happens. This surveillance allows them to gain information
they missed or were unable to gather earlier, clarify the information
they already have, and/or discover that some of their information
was inaccurate or outdated (and now they have a whole new set of
problems to solve!).
In some cases, this will be easy because the PCs will be targeting a
public place (e.g., a museum or casino). They can just show up and
scope the place out at their leisure.
Other targets, however, may require the PCs to take advantage of
special circumstances (or create those circumstances for
themselves). The event schedule they found in Phase 2 can provide
opportunities not only for the heist itself, but also for surveillance.
In other cases, they may need to interact with the target under false
pretenses or use forged credentials in order to carry out their initial
surveillance.
In prepping a heist, it can be useful to figure out explicitly what
information can only be obtained through onsite surveillance. One
really easy division is to make it easy to obtain floorplans of the
target, but to only be able to ascertain limited information about the
security measures in place without being onsite.
When running the surveillance opportunity, once again
remember that the expected outcome is for the PCs to succeed in
carrying out their surveillance. Barring complete and utter
catastrophe, the worst outcome for the PCs should only be one of
the following:
They only get some of the information they need.

They get misleading information.

They do something sufficiently suspicious that security is
heightened or changed.

One (but not all) of the PCs gets IDed, making their participation
in the heist more difficult or impossible.
Generally speaking, failure in a surveillance opportunity should
not result in the entire heist failing unless the PCs deliberately take
an action that would obviously cause that to happen.

PHASE 4: PREP WORK

Possibly running in tandem with onsite surveillance, the team will
also need to make preparations for the job. This prep often takes the
form of altering the information the PCs have received—creating
new entrances, blinding security cameras, subverting guards, etc. It
may also involve creating bespoke resources (or simply shopping for
necessary supplies).
In modern or science fiction heists, prep work almost always
includes figuring out some way to tap the security feeds so that the
PCs can monitor the entire facility. If you’re not comfortable
improvising what they see, prep the appropriate adversary rosters
and also daily schedules so that the PCs can figure out the “usual
routine” at the site.

PHASE 5: THE OPERATION

Finally, the heist itself. The PCs try to carry out their plan.
To run the heist, you’ll use the same procedure as a raid. One key
difference, because a heist will usually feature a more detailed plan
and preparation, is the inclusion of one or more twists: unexpected
circumstances that the PCs didn’t anticipate or that they missed in
their research. These twists can either be gotchas (twists that you
prepare ahead of time and that the PCs have no way of anticipating
—“Oh crap! Mrs. Roberts came home early!”) or complications

arising from failed checks (either during their legwork or during the
operation itself).
In my experience, you’re generally going to want to rely more on
complications rather than gotchas. First, skipping gotchas will save
you from unnecessary prep work. Second, it’s simply more
interesting for the players to look back and understand where the
complications are coming from.
(Which is not to say you should never use a gotcha: One really
great gotcha can elevate a scenario to the next level.)
To break this down more explicitly, successfully executing a heist
will usually involve a series of skill checks. A single failed check
should not cause the entire plan to immediately fail. Instead, you’ll
use fail forward techniques to generate complications. These
complications on failed skill checks are why you can get away with
giving the PCs “perfect” information in Phase 2 and Phase 3: Among
other things, you can use complications to introduce “oh no, he got
a new safe” obstacles on the fly that effectively alter or reveal gaps
in the information the PCs acquired.
Finally, to reiterate something of primary importance: Avoid
twists of any type that automatically scuttle the entire job and/or
negate all the PCs’ planning. They not only suck but will also
strongly discourage your players from pursuing heist strategies in
the future. It’s much more interesting to create a new problem and
let the players figure out how to solve it.
IT’S HEISTS ALL THE WAY DOWN
Sometimes while making their plan, the PCs will discover that they
need some special resource. How can they get it? Another heist, of
course! This might be a full-fledged scenario in its own right, but
often a micro-heist (or a simple raid) will suffice.

PREPPING THE HEIST

So what, exactly, should you prep for a heist scenario?

Blueprints (both the GM’s and those intended for PCs to discover)
Defenses (most likely including adversary rosters, security
cameras, traps, etc.)

Event Schedule (including surveillance and heist opportunities)

Gotchas (optional)
It’s actually a very short list. Everything else flows from your
procedure and active play.

HEIST OPTION: THE FLASHBACK

A common motif of heist stories in other mediums is the audience
twist: Something goes horribly wrong for the team and it seems as if
their whole plan is falling apart … but then it’s revealed that the
“problem” was actually part of the plan the whole time!
These kinds of audience-focused twists generally don’t work in an
RPG because the players aren’t passive audience members. They
aren’t just watching the heist; they’re actively participating in it and
they know everything their characters know. And that’s okay. RPGs
offer different rewards than passive viewership does.
If you’d like to add something similar to these twists to your heist
scenarios, however, you can do so with a flashback mechanic.
The basic concept is that, at some point during the heist, a player
can choose to initiate a flashback—a scene that took place in the
past and reveals a plan and/or preparation that the PC made. For
example:
They find themselves trapped in a room with only one exit. “It’s a
good thing I planted those C4 charges to blow open the wall for
our exfiltration!”

A guard suddenly comes around the corner and spots them! So the
players frame a flashback where they bribe the guard and it turns
out he’s actually here to help them.

They’ve upgraded their safe to a Diablo J34! “Perfect. I was
actually a security consultant for Diablo during the design of the
J34 and I know an exploit.”
There are some RPGs—like Blades in the Dark, Leverage, and
Night’s Black Agents—that are specifically designed to incorporate
flashbacks, but this mechanic can be incorporated into other RPGs
as long as you follow a few core principles.
First, the use of a flashback must either have a cost or be limited.
In D&D, for example, you might limit the group to a total number of
flashbacks equal to their highest proficiency bonus. In addition, a
proposed flashback must be somehow associated with a skill or tool
the character is proficient with, their background, or a class ability.
Second, the flashback can change context but not continuity. A
player can frame a scene to bribe the guard who just spotted them,
but they can’t frame a scene where they assassinated the guard the
night before (because the guard has already been established as
being in the scene). They can plant C4 to blow a hole in the wall,
but they can’t simply declare that they had an extra door built into
the room (since the room was already described as not having
another exit).
Third, the flashback must be plausible. Is it really possible that
they could have brought in contractors to build an extra door in
Rodríguez’s mansion? As the GM, you may need to simply veto a
proposed flashback scene if it’s impossible that the PCs could have
done it, but you’ll often get better results asking the players to
explain how the seemingly impossible could have actually been
achieved.
Fourth, the flashback scene must be resolved. Just because the
PCs want to plant C4 or bribe the guard doesn’t mean they actually
succeeded. A flashback scene should generally be kept short and
sweet, but it should still be framed and played through as a scene. It
will likely involve skill checks, and if those checks are failed they
can (and should) create complications for the heist—the C4 doesn’t

go off, the guard took the PCs’ money but is planning to betray
them, security changed the code on the door locks, etc.
If you choose to implement flashbacks in your heist scenarios, you
should also be aware that some players won’t like them: The
atemporal resolution may feel weird to them or, even more
importantly, the ex post facto discovery of information that
would’ve been known to their character and affected their decisionmaking can be game-breakingly alienating for some players. For
some of these players, it may be useful to keep in mind that there
are all kinds of stuff that happen in their characters’ lives that aren’t
actually played out at the table, and flashbacks simply assert that
some of these events were more significant than others. But for
many players, the problem is more fundamental than that and it
really can ruin the game for them, so make sure to discuss this
technique with your players before (and after!) implementing it.
“PLANNING SUCKS!”
A lot of the fun of a heist scenario comes from creating and
executing a plan. (“I love it when a plan comes together!”) But
for some groups, the actual planning isn’t fun. In some cases,
this is because they’ve had bad experiences with their plans
immediately getting blown up (which is why we don’t do
that!); in other cases, planning just isn’t something they enjoy
or it can get bogged down in analysis paralysis.
For groups like this, you’ll often be better off running more
action-packed raids than heists. But you can also create heistlike (or heist-lite) scenarios by doing the following:
Streamlining the Gather Information phase by having each
PC make a single skill check of their choice to learn
information.

Setting a short timer (perhaps 10 or 15 minutes) to limit the
time spent planning the operation.

Using flashbacks to simulate more elaborate planning during
the heist.

“THERE ARE A million stories in the city,” as the saying goes.

The city itself is rarely the adventure, but it is nevertheless a vital
part of many campaigns. In campaigns that focus primarily on
exploring dungeons or venturing forth into the wilderness, the city
serves as the party’s home base—the place of refuge and security
where they can rest and resupply.
In urban campaigns, of course, the city itself plays host to
dungeons, raids, heists, mysteries, and more. The PCs might be
investigating strange conspiracies,
a criminal crew securing territory or performing scores,
engaging in faction-based intrigue, seeking political economic
dominance,
secret agents locked in a cold war drama,
police detectives solving episodic mysteries, or
noble scions treating the city and its people as their playthings.
The city is, therefore, not one thing but many, and here you’ll find
a suite of tools for bringing your city to vivid life, not only creating
a vibrant backdrop for your campaign but also integrating
adventures into the urban environment and creating others that are
uniquely born from the city.

THE CITY
As we get ready to create our city, our assumption in this chapter is
that the city is either the setting for the entire campaign or, at the
very least, a place that the PCs are going to be exploring for a while.

If that’s not the case—if the PCs are just flying in for a single
adventure—then the techniques in this chapter are overkill. You
may still find some of them useful, but you can—and should!—get
by with two or three paragraphs broadly describing the city, plus
whatever material is immediately relevant to the adventure you’re
running.
But for a city that’s either the focus of play or simply pervasive in
your campaign, we’ll be prepping a city map and gazetteer to
detail the city, and then using a handful of simple techniques to
immerse the players in the setting.
SMALL TOWNS
For the most part, this chapter is also going to be assuming that
you’re making a full-fledged city. For smaller communities—villages,
remote space stations, etc.—you can use some of these same
techniques, but you’ll want to scale them down. (For example, a
small village may only have one roadside inn or it might lack one
entirely; you don’t need to try to stuff additional options into a
community if it’s not right for the setting you’re designing.)

THE CITY MAP

First, we need a map. If it’s a city in the real world, track down a
street map. Google Maps or Apple Maps will be invaluable
resources, but I wouldn’t recommend relying on them as your
primary map. You really want something that lets you come to grips
with the city in its totality, so buy a paper street map or do an
image search for something comparable. The real world has done a
whole bunch of development work for you here, so you’ll want
something that captures all of those little details (like individual
street names).
If it’s a city that you’re creating, you’ll obviously need to draw the
map. (Or generate one. The tools for this are getting better all the
time.) If you use the maps of real-world cities or those typically

published for fantasy cities—like the sample map of Anyoc on the
next page—as guides, however, you’ll be overwhelmed with details:
Every single street is shown! Many of them are named! Look at all
those buildings!
But you don’t need all those details to get started. In fact, I would
argue that you definitely shouldn’t try to include all those details
right now. Instead, give yourself some space to develop and learn
more about the city. If you try to lock yourself into specific streets
and buildings right away, you’re far more likely to end up with
something generic while leaving yourself with no room to innovate.

Your map only needs two things right now:
the city’s districts, and

the major connecting routes.
Let’s start with the city’s districts. We’ll refer to these as
“districts” for convenience, but they can go by any number of
names:
neighborhoods
wards

quarters
enclaves
zones

regios
precincts
spires

vicinages

rayons
boroughs
fùjìn

And so forth. In fact, it’s not unusual for cities in the real world to
have multiple designations (districts divided into neighborhoods,
zones split into quarters, etc.). The labels you choose for these can
tell you a lot about the city’s character.
As you’re slicing your city into pieces, the sweet spot you’re
aiming for is somewhere between six and twelve districts. You want
enough divisions to give the city texture—so that being in Ausbury
feels different from being in Northbridge or the Groves—but not so
many that either you or the players are overwhelmed.
If you’re working from a real city, you can immediately run into
problems here because they’ll frequently have dozens and dozens of

“neighborhoods” or “boroughs” or whatever. Manhattan, for
example, has fifty-three different neighborhoods. That’s almost
certainly too many! It would be exhausting to develop them all for
play, and unless the players were already familiar with Manhattan,
that amount of detail would just turn into noise.
So what you’d want to do with Manhattan is take a step back and
look at broader divisions. Perhaps something like this:
Washington Heights
Harlem

Upper West Side
Upper East Side
Midtown
West Side
East Side

Lower Manhattan
You might go with a slightly different division: Maybe Harlem
should be split into East, West, and Central. Maybe Central Park
should be added as its own district, or Chinatown is important
enough in your campaign to be its own district alongside Lower
Manhattan.
The flip side of this is that you can come back later and say,
“We’re spending a lot of time in the Upper East Side, so let’s get
more specific and talk about Lenox Hill, Carnegie Hill, and
Yorktown.” And you can obviously do the same thing with a city of
your creation, diving into a district and revealing the local
neighborhoods (or whatever the local label is).
With districts in place, you can now add the major routes. You
basically need to answer two questions here:
First, how do you enter and leave the city?
Second, how do you travel to and from each district?

Basically, when the PCs are in Lower Manhattan and they say
they want to go to the Upper East Side, you want to be able to say,
“You take Lafayette Street to Midtown and then follow Park Avenue
to the Upper East Side.”
At a bare minimum, you’ll likely end up with a loose network of
major roads. You can stop there, but you’ll often want to push on. A
city’s unique character can often be defined by its transportation.
You can also emphasize the fantastic nature of your speculative
settings with fabulist transportation routes: Zeppelin towers. Etheric
railways. Fairy roads. Spaceports.
(Again, you don’t need to develop a complete subway schedule:
Where are the major tunnels? What’s the biggest or most important
station in each district?)

THE GAZETTEER

A gazetteer is a geographical index or directory, used in conjunction
with a map to describe an area and its features. For a roleplaying
game, it’s an encyclopedic description of the setting that’s separate
from the notes for any specific scenario (although this distinction
can get a little muddy in actual practice). That might include
locations, characters, history, etc. For example:
SOUTH BRIDGE
South Bridge is a wide, fixed-arch bridge about 30 feet across
that carries the traffic of the North Road as it crosses the Anya
River southeast of the citadel.
South Bridge is located at the center of the University of Anyoc.
As part of the university, an effort has been made to make the
bridge particularly appealing to the eye. The bridge is
constructed primarily of anlos and paved with vaylos—a beauty
of pale blue and violet. Indeed, the sight of the South Bridge is
famed along the North Road, and the structure stands as an
emblem of pride for both the university and the city as a whole.

For a real-world example of the type of content found in a city
gazetteer, take a peek at any travel guide. In fact, if you’re prepping
a real-world city for your campaign, a travel guide is a great
resource, allowing you to spend as much or more time culling key
content as you are creating new stuff.
To begin creating the gazetteer for your city, we’ll start by keying
each district.
First, describe the district’s general character. This can be as
simple as a couple of sentences, but you can dive into more detail
like so:
What types of businesses are found there?
What’s the architecture?

What ethnicities or other population types live there?
What’s the history of the district?

Once you’ve sketched in the broad strokes of the district, make a
list of specific landmarks and briefly describe them. You might be
able to get away with just one, but you’ll probably want to have at
least three per district by the end of your initial prep. (You’ll likely
be adding more later, though, so it’s okay to leave a few gaps for
now.)
The term landmark may trap you into thinking about statues or
big, famous buildings. Those definitely count, but for our purposes a
landmark is really any location in the district that could be casually
noticed by someone traveling through it. So if you put the Lion’s
Purr tavern in a district, you can put it on the landmarks list.
If your city becomes detailed enough, you may want to eventually
break out a separate list of “major landmarks” for each district for
the sake of utility, but even this list will likely be (and arguably
should be) esoteric, focusing at least as much on the sites that have
become relevant to you, your players, and the campaign as it does
on the big stuff that would make a generic tourist’s guide.

With the raw foundations of your districts in place, you’ll bring
the city fully online by prepping a list of services.
Exactly which services you’ll want to list is going to be very
dependent on the campaign you’re prepping. If the PCs are
wandering adventurers coming to the city for the first time, for
example, you’ll likely want to have a list of inns. If the PCs live in
the city, on the other hand, maybe that’s not so important.
Some common service categories, however, include the following:
Hotels/inns
Bars/taverns
Shopping
Banking

Hospitals/healing
Legal services
Gambling

Entertainment
Specialists (locksmiths, magi, assassins, sages, bodyguards, etc.)
Before you get too lost in the weeds here, though, it’s important
to remember that you’re not trying to list every single example of
each service in the city. In many cases, you probably can’t. Take
Galveston, Texas, for example. This modest town with a population
of 50,000 has
dozens of hotels and more than a hundred bars. Even if you
wanted to prep all those options, would it really be useful at the
table?
What is useful at the table is having enough options that the
players can make a meaningful choice. A rule of thumb might be to
have three options for each service. With inns, for example, I’ll often
prep a high-class, middle-class, and low-class option. For
entertainment, I might offer a theater, a dance hall, and a
gladiatorial arena. The goal, of course, is for each option to be

clearly distinct from the others in a way that is (or could be)
relevant to the PCs.
You may have already placed some of these services as you were
designing landmarks for your district. As you add more services to
fill in the gaps, place them in specific districts and (unless they’re
some sort of hidden, underground operation) add them to your
landmark lists, too.
ADVENTURE SITES
It’s very likely that at some point you’ll be adding an adventure
location to your city: the entrance to a forgotten dungeon. A
bank vault to rob. A haunted mansion.
Some adventure sites might be a landmark. (“The abandoned
house up on the hill? That’s the Old Tannerly manor. No one
lives there now. Not since the Incident.”) Often, though, the
PCs will only learn about these locations as the result of a
scenario hook.
You should certainly know where on the map these adventure
sites are located, but should they be added to your gazetteer?
Personally, I don’t want my references for running the city
getting choked up with a lot of ephemeral stuff (Ruby’s House,
Bob’s Wheelchair Factory, A Random Warehouse). So, for me,
it’s fine if a lot of adventure sites are only detailed in my notes
for a specific adventure.
In other cases, though, a location developed for an adventure is
important or becomes so: Maybe I create the Terwilliger Vaults,
a major banking service in the city that I just didn’t know
existed previously. Or the PCs become close friends with Ruby.
Or they get a job at Bob’s Wheelchair Factory. Or they buy the
warehouse.

Ultimately, there’s no hard-and-fast rule: It’s what works for
you.

THE LOCATION KEY
You can key locations to your city map with numbers the same
way you do rooms in a dungeon, although you may want to
assign letters to different districts to create an alphanumeric
system that will keep locations easily grouped in your notes.
(For example, locations in the Kadbury neighborhood could be
K1, K2, etc.)
This key may include landmarks, adventure sites, services, and
other locations (like an important NPC’s house). Even with
everything grouped together like this into a single key for easy
use, you’ll still want to maintain separate index lists for
landmarks (by district) and services (by type of service), as
you’ll find these references essential while running the city.

SCENIC ENCOUNTERS

A key thing that makes the urban environment feel distinct from
other adventure locales is the constant activity: The streets and
businesses are bustling with activity, and you want the players to
feel like there’s stuff happening all the time and just out of sight. We
achieve this at the table through the use of scenic encounters.
Scenic encounters are similar to the random encounters we use in
dungeons (and we’ll talk about how they get triggered in a
moment), but they don’t involve hostile denizens trying to stab the
PCs with sharp, pointy things. (Well, not usually …) Instead, they
provide little slices of life from the city streets:
An out-of-town messenger has become lost. They stop the PCs to
ask for directions.

1d6 elves are standing in the middle of the street, arguing loudly
with a half-orc.
A woman is selling broadsheets.

2d6 kids are playing stickball in an alley.

An out-of-control wagon is barreling down the street. (The driver
has suffered a heart attack.)

A bandit attempts to pick a random PC’s pocket. If the pickpocket
is caught in the act, 1d4 + 2 bandits and a bandit captain
emerge from a nearby alley.
As you can see, scenic encounters provide a broad range of
interactions. It’s not unusual for the PCs to simply walk on by, the
encounter having served as just a bit of local color to paint the
scene.
You can, of course, design these to be either bespoke encounters
or procedural ones. Either way, there are four broad approaches to
prepping scenic encounters.
BASIC CITY ENCOUNTERS
Prep a single table of scenic encounters for the entire city and use
them regardless of where the PCs are in the city. You’ll probably
want about 20 encounters to get started, and you can also spice
things up by using improvisation to “color” an encounter to the
current situation. (“Ruffians” at the Docks might be a group of
drunken sailors, while the same encounter in the Merchant District
might be gangsters shaking down a local businesswoman for
protection money.)
DISTRICT ENCOUNTERS
Prep a separate set of encounters and encounter table for each
district, customizing the encounters to reflect that district’s
demography and unique flavor. Each district encounter list will be
shorter than a citywide list (perhaps only six or eight to get started),
but obviously prepping a separate list for every district will require
more prep.

HYBRID ENCOUNTERS
To split the difference between flavor and prep load, you could
include “District Encounter” on your citywide encounter table
(likely filling multiple slots). This will reduce the number of such
encounters you need to prep, and you’ll need to prep only a couple
of unique encounters for each district that can be used when the
District Encounter result is rolled.
SHARED DISTRICT ENCOUNTERS
A more complicated method of reducing (or, perhaps, maximizing
the utility of) prep is to use separate district encounter tables, but
have certain “shared” encounters that appear on multiple lists. (For
example, perhaps Ruffians can appear as random encounters in the
Docks, Ironleaf, and the Merchant District, but not in the Gilded
Ward.)
LIFE IN THE CITY
With your city sufficiently detailed, it’s time to bring it to the table.
If at all possible, I recommend that this include showing the
players the city map. (This might involve prepping a player
version of the map.)
The key to running the city during play is that virtually all actions
in the city boil down to either finding information or going to a
location (and doing something there). But it turns out that when
the PCs are looking for information, that also almost always involves
going to a location (a library, a sage’s tower, etc.). Even if the
players aren’t certain where they can find the information and are
just canvassing the city looking for answers, ultimately you’ll need
to figure out where they finally find that information (and that will,
of course, be a location). Plus, the information that the PCs are
looking for will often be, either directly or indirectly, a location, too
—a service they need, a resource, the place where their enemy is
hiding out, etc.
So it turns out that almost everything the PCs do “in the city” (as
opposed to in a specific location) can be broadly summarized as
going to a location.

Once the PCs are heading to a location, look at your notes for the
district they’re heading to. (This may be the same district they’re
currently in.) Then:
1. Name the district and point to it on the map. (“You head over to
the Docks.”)
2. Mention a landmark—a major street they travel down, a
building they pass, an art installation, etc. (“Passing down
Fishwives’ Lane, the smell of gutted tuna thick in the air …”)
3. Roll 1d6 for a scenic encounter check. On a roll of 1, generate a
scenic encounter for the district they’re heading to. (“… you see a
dragonborn fishmonger offering to sell freshly harvested oyster
pearls. He says one of them is a rare rainbow pearl, a sign of
good luck.”)
4. Describe the location they arrive at. (“Dominic’s hovel is tucked
into a narrow side street just past the red docks. There’s smoke
coming out of the crooked chimney, so somebody must be
home.”)
And that’s all it takes.
The districts and landmarks weave together the geographical
fabric of the city. The encounters provide a low level of activity not
directly connected to the PCs or what they’re immediately engaged
with, creating the sensation that the city is in constant motion.
PLACING SCENIC ENCOUNTERS
A scenic encounter can occur anywhere en route to the PCs’
destination. That can be any random street (or subway tunnel or
teleportation hub), but consider placing it at either the district’s
landmark or their destination. It’s a convenient way of adding
context to procedurally generated content, and it can also be a great
way of adding unexpected complications to whatever location the
PCs are heading to.

Of course, this procedure doesn’t need to be a straitjacket. Maybe
you mention two or three landmarks instead of just one (perhaps
one per district they pass through?). Maybe you complicate things
by checking for encounters in each district the PCs pass through. Or,
conversely, once you’ve established the life of the city as a pervasive
presence at the table, you may find that effective pacing demands
fast-forwarding past an encounter and cutting straight to the action.
I recommend following this procedure rigorously for a couple or
three sessions to really get a feel for it and make sure you’ve
internalized the rhythms of the city, but then do what feels right,
knowing that you can always return to this procedure as a safe and
effective foundation.
TIME MANAGEMENT
How long does it take to do stuff in the city? This question
becomes particularly important if the PCs are facing time
pressure or if they’ve split up (see Splitting the Party).
I usually think in terms of
the hour,

the watch (4 hours), or

the half day (morning/afternoon).
Which mental construct I find most useful depends on how
“meaty” the PCs’ planned actions are. If someone is planning to
gather information down at the Docks, I might think to myself,
“That’ll take about half a day.” And so the active question
becomes, “What is everyone else doing during that half day?”
(Or, alternatively, “What are the bad guys doing with that
time?”)
Even in the absence of other factors, keeping the passage of
time concrete—even if it’s only in the broadest strokes—will
give the actions of the PCs more weight and their choices more

meaning. It also prevents each individual day from becoming
overburdened with action, which will help make each day (and
what was done during that day) more memorable.

INTRODUCING THE CITY

Now that we’ve established our basic procedure, let’s take a closer
look at our first session: How do we introduce a new city to the
players?
If one or more of the PCs live in the city or are otherwise familiar
with it, particularly if it’s going to be the focal setting for the entire
campaign, I will prep a short player’s briefing packet to orient
them. These are described in more detail as part of the Creating
Your Campaign extra credit (see here), but will include:
the map,

two or three sentences describing each district, and

maybe one page of common services (list of taverns, list of
weaponsmiths, etc.).
You may note that this material conveniently mirrors the material
you’ve prepped for yourself. You can often just strip out your
encounter tables, make a couple of other minor changes, and be
good to go.
Try to give the player their briefing packet ahead of time if
possible; that way they can familiarize themselves with it. If only
one (or some) of the PCs are from the city, the great thing is that
they can now introduce the city to the other players in character!
But what about the adventurer at the gate scenario, where the
PCs are coming to the city for the first time?
Generally, I will still give them the map. Even if the PCs
technically wouldn’t have one, it’s just too useful as an easy point of
common reference at the table. I find it very effective to
describe the countryside around the city,

describe the city as they approach it,

roleplay a short encounter at the gate (with guards, other
travelers, or whatever else makes sense), and
describe their first sight of the city as they step through the gate
and I hand the map to them.
If the city isn’t walled or they’re arriving via an airship or it’s an
underwater city and they’re arriving on the back of a whale, you’ll
obviously need to adjust the specifics here!
POSTER MAPS
If you’ve got a city map that’s detailed enough or just looks slick
enough to support it, I heartily recommend printing out a postersized version and hanging it on the wall of your playing space. I’ll
use a laser pointer to indicate locations from my seat during play.
At this point, as they’re standing just inside the city gate (or the
local equivalent of this liminal space), focus on the players’ goals,
but use those goals as a vector for the player briefing.
For example, if the players say that they’re going to spend a day
or two getting to know the city, that’s super simple: You can just
give them the player briefing.
But maybe they say something like, “Let’s find an inn.”
If it’s a common service, present them with the multiple options
for that service you prepped earlier. (You can frame this as what a
friendly local or their smartphone tells them, or follow their lead if
they propose some other means for finding whatever they’re looking
for.) Specifically call out the different districts these services are in.
If they went looking for a weapons shop, for example, you might
say, “There’s an elven bowyer in Dovecote or dwarven crafters in
Kadbury.” Now you’re not just saying, “These districts exist.” You’re
inviting the players to make a choice based on these districts. That’s
significant. The districts are now an active part of the players’

thinking about the setting. The more they do that, the more the city
will come alive in their imaginations.
At this point, the PCs are going to pick a location to go to—either
a common service they’ve selected or whatever specific location
brought them to the city in the first place (e.g., the tower of the
High Mage Ghulak). This is simple: Just use the urban procedure we
detailed above … but with one important addition!
For the district of the location they choose, include the
description of the district from the player briefing. You can probably
work these two or three sentences into the description of their
journey to the inn or tower or whatever.
As the players work their way through their shopping list (or
whatever brought them to the city), you’ll be organically building
up their understanding of the city over time. The scenic encounters,
landmarks, and locations found in the scenarios you’re running will
gradually draw them further into the setting, resulting in them
setting goals that are increasingly specific: “Let’s find the leader of
the Red Bandit pickpockets who tried to rob us” or “That abandoned
lighthouse looks cool, let’s go check it out!”
In play, the scenario might look something like this:
The PCs enter a new town and go looking for an inn.

“People milling around the gate suggest three choices: The Lion’s
Purr in Midtown, the Wandering Sword in the Merchant District,
or the Wallowed Pig in the Penury Ward.”
The players select the Wandering Sword.

“You head south into the Merchant District. Most of the buildings
here are two stories high—small businesses with apartments for
the owners above them. You notice that there’s an abandoned
lighthouse standing in the middle of the district … which is a
weird place for a lighthouse to be. You find the Wandering Sword
on Southward Street.”

At this point you can describe the Wandering Sword and have a
short scene there while the PCs arrange for their rooms. They
decide to check out that lighthouse.

On the way to the lighthouse, you describe them passing through
the Market Square (another landmark in the Merchant District).
As they leave the market, they have a random encounter with
Red Bandits who attempt to waylay them.

After dispatching the Red Bandits, they proceed to the lighthouse
(which is a small adventure site you’ve prepped).

When they return to their rooms at the Wandering Sword, the
encounter check is negative, so you simply describe them passing
through the Market Square again (it’s night now, so the stalls are
deserted).
Discussing their plans for the next day, the PCs decide to find the
Red Bandits’ gang house. So the next morning you call for a
Gather Information check and, when they succeed, say, “You ask
around and discover it’s an open secret that the Red Bandits
control a dilapidated apartment building in Penury Ward, which
is officially known as Laketon but has been riddled with poverty
for generations.” (You’ve snuck in a little extra district briefing
there.)
The PCs head for the apartment building.

“You head down Tabernacle Way [landmark] into Penury Ward.
Passing the Church of the Bloody Saint [landmark], you’re
approached by several of the beggars who camp in the church’s
yard.” The beggars here are a random encounter and inspired you
to think that the Church of the Bloody Saint would be a good
landmark to use here. After a short roleplaying scene with the
beggars (during which you might seed other rumors or
information about the city), the PCs continue to the apartment
building.
And so forth.

Once the players are familiar with a district, of course, you can
obviously stop briefing them on the district. At this point, the
newcomers have acclimated to the city and you simplify back into
the standard urban procedure.
BACKGROUND EVENTS
Another great way to add life to a city is through the use of
background events. These are described in more detail in the
Extra Credit section, on page 456.

DOWNTIME
What happens to the heroes between one adventure and the next?
We refer to this as downtime, and a city often lies at the heart of
it: If the PCs are venturing forth to loot strange dungeons and save
the world, they return home to the city for rest and respite before
the next call to adventure sounds. If the campaign is based in the
city, then the long-term agendas of the PCs will obviously become
embroiled with urban affairs.
It’s possible to run downtime at the same pace we use for
adventures; it’s also possible that the PCs will be kept so busy with
thrilling action that they never get a break. But often there are
projects and goals that need to be resolved at a different scale—stuff
that takes weeks or months rather than hours or days. To
accommodate this, we use a special downtime structure.

PROGRESS CLOCKS

To handle downtime actions effectively, we’ll first need an advanced
technique for making rulings called a progress clock.
Progress clocks are a simple, visual way of tracking how close a
particular outcome is to happening. There are a lot of different ways
that you can use a progress clock, but for right now we’ll focus on
two: failure clocks and project clocks.
Set up a failure clock when the PCs begin an extended or multistep endeavor (e.g., sneaking into a mansion, tracking a band of
orcs, investigating a cult’s activities in Dweredell).
1. Create a progress clock by drawing a circle and dividing it into
four, six, eight, or ten parts. More parts mean the task will take
longer to accomplish.

2. Set a significant consequence or overall fail condition. (For
example, security at the mansion realizes there are intruders and
the alarm is raised; the PCs lose the trail of the orcs and can no
longer follow them; or the cultists succeed in summoning a
demon who begins rampaging through the Great Market.)
3. Whenever the PCs fail a relevant check, fill in one section of the
progress clock.

4. When the progress clock is filled, trigger the consequence or fail
condition.
A failure clock can be used for any type of check, but can work
well as the default consequence of failing forward on a check, as
described on page 280: If you can’t think of any other consequence
for the failed check, just fill in the next section of the progress clock
and explain the connection.
A project clock is similar, but inverted:
1. Create a progress clock.
2. Define what the successful outcome of the project is.
3. Whenever the PCs succeed on a relevant check, fill in one section
of the progress clock.
4. When the progress clock is filled, the project has been
successfully completed.
Multiple characters can collaborate on a project, of course, with
each separate success being tracked on the same clock.
Failed checks while pursuing a project should have meaningful
consequences. (That might include filling in sections of an opposed
failure clock, which could result in the project’s ultimate failure if
completed.)
EXCEPTIONAL SUCCESSES
If a check on a project clock is exceptionally successful, you may fill
in more than one section of the progress clock. For example, in
D&D, for every 5 points by which the check result exceeds the DC of
the check, fill in an additional section.
Progress clocks should always follow the fiction, by which I
mean that if something in the game world should affect the progress
of the clock, then it does, even if a check isn’t involved. This can

include the use of spells, special resources, or the like, and it can
work both ways, by either adding or removing sections of the clock.
For example, Granger flubs his lock-picking check while the group
is trying to infiltrate the Sael family estate. The GM rules that
Granger has gotten the door open, but he’s damaged the lock in the
process, and so the GM fills in one section of the Alert the Guards
failure clock. But then Katalina uses her mending cantrip to repair
the damage to the lock, and so the GM erases that section. As they
slip through the door, the sorcerer Gorin casts invisibility on the
group, and the GM decides that could also reasonably decrease the
clock.
In other situations, this might even mean bypassing the clock
completely. For example, a PC has been working to build a
longboat, but then they get access to a wish spell and use it to get
the longboat they’ve always wanted. The clock is, obviously, no
longer relevant.
At the table, progress clocks can exist in one of three states:
Open Clock: When you create the clock or fill in a section, you
show it to the players. This is often the easiest method, making it
crystal clear how much progress they’ve made or what the
consequences of a failed check are with no fuss.

Hidden Progress: When you create the clock, you either directly
or indirectly tell the players that it exists. (For example, when
they’re sneaking into a mansion you can clearly state that there’s
a risk the security team will detect them.) But then the clock
itself remains hidden. The players don’t know how large the clock
is or exactly what the progress on the clock is. Because the clock’s
progress is hidden from them, however, you’ll need to clearly
communicate progress and the consequences of failure to them.
(For example, describing to Granger how he damaged the lock
while opening the door. In the case of a failure clock, such
explanations will likely also inform exactly how the failure plays
out—in this case, the alarm possibly sounding because someone
noticed the signs of tampering on the lock.)

Secret Clock: With a secret clock, you create the clock without
telling the players it exists and it serves strictly as a tool for you
to keep track of things. As with a hidden progress clock, of
course, it’s your responsibility to continue clearly communicating
the consequences of the clock’s progression to the players in your
description of the game world.

FINDING DOWNTIME

During each period of downtime, each PC will get to take one
downtime action, but you first have to define how long each period
of downtime is in the campaign world: A week? A month? A season?
A year?
You want this to be consistent across the entire campaign, but
which duration is the right one for your current campaign will
depend on the natural pace of that campaign. Are the PCs wrapped
up in a constant flurry of conspiracy and counter-conspiracy? Then
you’ll probably want a very short duration, like a week. Are they
thieves who carefully research and prepare for every job? Then
measuring downtimes in months or seasons may be perfect. Are they
monster hunters who only have to go forth from their village when
the summer thaws free the eldritch horrors from the ancient
glaciers? Then a yearlong downtime would seem to sync flawlessly
with their adventures.
The other trick, in my experience, is making sure that the
transition to downtime actually happens. Adventures are exciting! It
can be very easy to go rushing from one adventure headlong into
another, particularly as a campaign develops over time; the stakes
start to rise, and one adventure leads directly to the next. (You
might even have multiple adventures happening at the same time!)
DOWNTIME IN THE BACKGROUND
As a variant, instead of taking a break from adventuring to
perform downtime actions, you can instead assume that the
downtime is happening in the background. This works

particularly well in urban campaigns, where you can just
assume that downtime activities are happening in the evenings
or during unexamined moments of play.
You probably won’t get a lot of downtime this way—since
adventures tend to be fast and furious compared to lengthy
downtime projects—and you won’t have the same focus on
downtime, but it’s an option if you really want to include
downtime-type aspects of play even when the rest of the
campaign isn’t well structured for it.
Having meaningful downtime, however, is great for allowing both
characters and the campaign world to develop at a more realistic
pace and in greater depth. So, to make sure it happens, there are a
couple broad approaches.
First, you can mandate it. This generally takes the form of
limiting the number of adventures per downtime period, For
example, “Characters go on one adventure per year,” and then you
resolve either yearlong or perhaps season-long downtimes between
each adventure.
This approach generally requires a really clear distinction
between one adventure and the next. If the PCs are exploring a
megadungeon, for example, or switching back and forth between
two different dungeons, it can be hard to figure out where one
adventure ends and the next begins. (And these lines tend to only
get blurrier with other scenario types.)
You’ll also need to make sure the adventures remain selfcontained. You can’t wrap up an adventure by saying, “Oh no! The
Onyx Prince has kidnapped the princess!” and then tell the players
they have a mandated one-year waiting period before they can go in
pursuit. Even if it’s mandated at the table, the downtime still has to
feel natural and justified in the game world.
The other option is to motivate it. Here the players consciously
choose when to begin downtime because it’s the only way to gain

some form of reward or advantage. Two common variants for D&D
are:
Extended Long Rests: You can only gain the benefits of a long
rest by taking a weeklong downtime.

Training: Even if they’ve gained the experience points required, a
PC can’t level up unless they spend one week/one month/one
season/one year training. (To be clear, the training is not the
character’s downtime action: The training period is defining the
downtime period, providing the opportunity to perform a
downtime action.)
Alternatively, you could, for example, set the training period to a
year, but then resolve monthlong downtime actions. (Or set the
extended long rest to a month, but resolve weeklong downtime
actions.) In this way, each time downtime is motivated, the PCs will
have the opportunity to take several downtime actions in a row.
In some cases, you’ll just have players and/or PCs who are
particularly interested in what downtime can provide. In those cases
you won’t need to mandate it or motivate it: The players will take
care of it for you!

DOWNTIME PROJECTS

Downtime is about achieving long-term projects. PCs will choose the
projects they want to pursue and the players will work with you to
define those projects. Successfully completing a project will usually
require multiple downtimes to achieve, although this can be
considerably sped up if multiple PCs collaborate on the same
project.
STEP 1: DEFINE THE PROJECT
Downtime projects are intentionally flexible. You should be able to
use them to accommodate any long-term goal or ambition the PCs
might have. Examples include:

Find a patron

Recruit a contact
Gain a title

Craft a magic item

Bring in the harvest
Build a robot

Learn a language
Brew mead

Spread rumors

Research an original spell

Decode an ancient language
Convert the godless

Build or improve a stronghold
Run a business

Compete in a tournament
Woo the marquess

Perfect a religious ritual
Raise a child

Create a work of art
The player should start by telling the GM what they want to
accomplish. This outcome should be specific, and the GM and player
should both make sure they have a clear (and mutual)
understanding of what completing the project will mean.
If the project feels too large or ambitious, then the GM should
work with the player to split it up into multiple projects. Otherwise,
the GM will proceed with designing the scope of the project.
MULTIPLE PROJECTS

There’s rarely any reason a PC can’t have multiple unfinished
projects floating around. They’ll just need to choose which project
they want to work on with each one of their downtime actions.
STEP 2: SETTING THE CLOCK
Some projects are resolved with a single downtime action and a
successful check, but in most cases you’ll want to set up a project
progress clock. Based on the difficulty and scope of the project, the
GM should set the number of clock segments and the default DC for
the project.
To set the number of clock segments, you should primarily
focus on how long you think the project should take to complete.
Then simply divide that by the duration of your downtime periods
to get a rough estimate for the number of segments the clock should
have. (Remember that you’re clocking a best-case scenario. The
worst-case scenario is what happens if the PCs keep missing their
checks.)
If the resulting clock has more than eight sections, then you
should probably break the project down into multiple steps (each of
which is its own project with its own clock).
The default DC for the project can be determined the way you
normally determine DCs. Note that this is explicitly a default
difficulty, and the GM can exercise their discretion to vary it
depending on skills, resources, or other variables during each
downtime action.
STEP 3: RISKS & PREREQUISITES
Many downtime projects will be straightforward, but others will be
complicated with risks and prerequisites.
A prerequisite is either:
A requirement before the project can be attempted. This might
be a different task or project that must be completed first, or a
resource (usually rare, expensive, or otherwise unusual). It’s not
unusual for these requirements to be adventure-based (e.g., you

must do an acclaimed deed before you can attempt to earn a
knighthood or you must retrieve ruby berries from the Fungal
Forest before you can make that potion), providing a great hook
for scenarios and wedding the PCs’ downtime activities to the rest
of play (and vice versa).

A cost that must be paid each time a downtime action is taken in
an effort to resolve the project. This might, again, be some rare
resource that gets expended, or it can be as simple as paying a
specific gold-piece value for supplies. (If the project is crafting an
object with a known value, divide half its market price by the
number of clock segments to determine the cost.)

A risk, on the other hand, is a predetermined complication or
consequence for failure—either failure of the project as a whole
(which can be determined by setting up an opposing failure clock)
or of each individual check. This could include options like:
An additional cost or the destruction of a vital resource
Alerting enemy agents of your activity

Gaining the enmity of an NPC or faction

A flaw that debilitates the intended outcome of the project (e.g.,
you risk creating a robot that doesn’t obey your commands)
Risk might also include active opposition from another NPC or
faction, whose checks will be used to fill the opposing failure clock.
EXPERIENCE FOR PROJECTS
Completing a project can be its own reward, but you might also
consider assigning an XP reward to the PC (or PCs) when they
successfully finish their project.
STEP 4: RESOLVE THE DOWNTIME ACTION

When a PC chooses to spend their downtime action on a project,
make an appropriate skill check—a tools check for crafting an item;
a Charisma (Persuasion) check for recruiting a contact; an
Intelligence (Investigation) check to decode a cipher; etc.—and
resolve the project clock accordingly.
Remember that a failed check should have consequences or create
complications, even if the project doesn’t have a predetermined risk.
(Use an opposed failure clock if no better option presents itself.)
Although you aren’t playing out every moment of the downtime
period, it’s still a good idea to roleplay downtime. This will usually
take the form of a short, representative scene. If a PC is wooing a
marquess, for example, you might roleplay a short scene of them
walking through her gardens on a moonlit night.
Ask the players to describe their efforts before rolling the dice,
and if multiple PCs are all working on the same project, you might
present that as a little montage.
OTHER DOWNTIMES
Many RPGs, like D&D, Blades in the Dark, and Ars Magica,
feature some form of downtime mechanic. When these mechanics
already exist, you may be able to use them in addition to, as part
of, or instead of the structure for downtime given here.

FACTION DOWNTIME
In an urban campaign, the PCs aren’t the only ones pursuing their
agendas during downtime. While they’re resolving their downtime
projects, you’ll be taking actions with your factions.

CREATING FACTIONS

A faction refers to any group or organization—whether formal or
informal—that has its own agenda, beliefs, and goals. They can
include:
Government agencies

Religious orders (or cults)
Orders of knighthood

Military factions (including mercenaries)
Assassins’ and thieves’ guilds

Criminal gangs and syndicates
Artisan guilds

Arcane sisterhoods

Adventuring guilds

Cabals and secret societies

Consortiums, corporations, and cartels
Covens

Rebel groups

Schools and universities
Racial enclaves

Sodalities, cadres, and coteries
A typical city will have dozens or, more likely, hundreds of
factions. In your campaign, however, you’re likely only going to be
focused on somewhere between four and eight of them at a time,
and so that’s how many you’re going to prep to get started.

For each faction, prep:
Short Description: One or two paragraphs ought to be enough to
get you started.
Tier: You want to be able to make action checks for the faction,
so you’ll need to give them some form of default rating in
whatever RPG you’re using. For D&D, you’ll rank them by tier
and list the faction’s proficiencies. If a faction is opposing
another faction or character of a lower tier, they gain advantage
on their checks. If they’re opposing a faction or character of a
higher tier, they suffer disadvantage.

Leader: The person (or perhaps small council of people) who are
in charge of the faction. You don’t need to do a full write-up of
these NPCs yet—a couple of sentences should suffice.

Agents: These are the members of the faction the PCs are most
likely to interact with or run afoul of. This is not a comprehensive
list of every single person who works for the faction, but you
want two or three different operatives or small action groups to
play with.

Allies & Enemies: Pick at least one other faction that this faction
is allied with and at least one other faction to be this faction’s
enemy. (These do not necessarily need to be from the list of
factions that you’re currently focused on and, therefore, prepping.
If that’s the case, you can just leave them as a name on the page
for now.)
Faction Clock: Each faction should have at least one (and almost
never more than three) faction clocks representing their current

agenda.
D&D FACTION TIER TABLE

As your campaign continues, other factions will likely become
important—they’ll gain your focus and/or the focus of the PCs.
That’s great! You can flesh them out with full write-ups (and
continue expanding them) as needed. You’ll also want to pay
attention to which factions are becoming less important and allow
them to fade into the background, generally aiming to keep the
factions you’re actively tracking and running in that sweet spot
between four and eight. If a faction that’s lost focus suddenly
becomes important again, you can always bring them back into the
spotlight!
A MIX OF FACTIONS
Particularly as you’re prepping your first batch of factions, it’s a
good idea to make sure that you’ve got several different types of
factions: If all of the factions are government agencies, for example,
your city will feel very one-dimensional.
On the other hand, it’s also a good rule of thumb to include more
than one faction in each sphere of influence to create rivalries: Two
criminal gangs can fight each other for territory. Three religious
orders can feud over doctrine. And so forth. Not every faction needs
a direct rival, but including at least a few will certainly liven things
up.

FACTION CLOCKS

Creating a faction clock works just like any other progress clock,
with you choosing four, six, or eight segments depending on the
complexity of the project. A faction’s clock is a quick, easy, and
effective way of tracking what their current agenda is and what
their current activities are.
The goal of the clock can be almost anything, but examples could
include:
Destroy a rival faction

Increase drug production

Secure territory
Acquire an ancient artifact
Retrieve valuable intel
Conduct a dark ritual

Raid a rival gang’s base

Assassinate a high-profile target
Establish a homeless shelter

Reclaim artifacts stolen from their homeland
Establish a new business

Forge an alliance with another faction
Large factions are likely doing lots and lots of stuff all at the same
time, so you once again have to choose your focus. The faction clock
you select might be literally the most important thing the faction is
doing right now, or it might just be the thing most likely to affect
the PCs or the thing the PCs care most about.

RESOLVING FACTION CLOCKS

During each downtime period, roll 1d6 for each active faction clock.
On a roll of 1, fill in one segment on the clock. Once all segments
have been filled, the faction has achieved their goal. You should
determine the fallout from that and then immediately create a new
faction clock for the faction: What’s their next goal?
ALTERNATIVE RESOLUTION
For a more complicated resolution, you can assign each faction
clock a DC and make an appropriate skill check using the faction’s
Tier proficiency. This will likely cause faction clocks to resolve
faster, and failed checks should also create complications for the
faction, resulting in a far more hectic pace.
For a blended approach, roll 1d4 for each faction clock, resolving
a skill check only on a result of 1.
AFFECTING A FACTION CLOCK
PCs may affect a faction clock, either assisting (by adding segments)
or opposing (by removing segments). This may be the result of an
adventure (the Morthbrood were trying to claim a powerful artifact,
but the PCs destroyed it) or a PC may choose to use their downtime
action to similar effect.
In some cases, it may also make sense for other factions to
similarly assist or oppose another faction’s clock instead of their
own. (Although this may also be represented by setting up an
opposing clock.)

INTERSECTING THE PCS

Each time a segment on a faction clock is filled in (or removed), that
represents the faction making tangible progress (or suffering a
significant setback) in achieving their goal: They’ve acquired an
asset, destroyed an obstacle, gained an ally, achieved a
breakthrough, and so forth.
You need to make that concrete—what, exactly, happened?—and
then you need to figure out how to make those events intersect the
PCs. That might be

reading about it in the newspaper,
getting a job offer,

witnessing the aftermath (hey … where’d that crater come from?),
hearing about it in casual conversation,
becoming targets,

getting caught up in the action, or

having their own downtime actions affected.
The resolution of your faction clocks gives life to your city,
generates a plethora of scenario hooks that you can offer to the
players, and provides a constant churn of activity for the PCs to
respond to and get involved with.

URBANCRAWLS
The urbancrawl is a campaign structure born of the city. You can
run episodic campaigns (see here) or node-based campaigns (see
here) in a city—node-based campaigns, in particular, are great in an
urban environment!—but with an urbancrawl, the city is no longer
merely a backdrop, but becomes the core experience and focus of
your game.
We’ve actually already created the scaffolding on which the
urbancrawl is built: the district map of the city.

You’re going to key content to each district, which the PCs will
then access by taking investigation actions.
The urbancrawl is designed to work in tandem with the other
urban structures we’ve already discussed: So the PCs will be moving
between districts, having encounters, taking downtime, reacting to
faction actions, and so forth, all the while delving deeper into the
city’s secrets and going on exciting adventures.

KEYING DISTRICTS

The content you’ll be keying to your city’s districts will generally be
scenes and scenarios. In fact, in this context, you can probably

think of a scene as just being a very, very short scenario, where the
beginning, middle, and end all play out in a single interaction.
Using Anyoc as an example, you might key the following:
The Groves: A vampire den has taken root in the saelleys. (A
dungeon adventure.)
Noriv: The city guard are hiring muscle to help clear out the
squatters around the North Well. Will the PCs sign up for the
paycheck or help protect the locals?

Northbridge: Jonas River of River Reagents is looking to hire
adventurers to fetch wyvern eggshells. (A patron, hooking to a
dungeon scenario located outside of the city.)

Skerton: Ramshackle urchins have been disappearing. (A mystery
scenario, see here.)
Anyoc Green: Several nobles have gathered outside the Council
and are engaged in political debate. (A scene.)

Kadbury: Lady Legat has recently returned from Seyrun with the
Imperial Ruby. (A heist scenario, see here.)

Festridge: A strange magical curse has infected the denizens of a
house with glowing purple energy. (A raid scenario, see here.)
Ausbury: The Noir Mantilla gang has been threatening
proprietors in the East Market. (A node-based scenario, see here.)
Dovecote: A professor at the University of Anyoc has been
murdered. (A mystery scenario, see here.)

Westface: A farmer in the West Market has found a strange
meteorite in his field. He’s looking to hire some bodyguards to
help him transport the meteorite safely to town, where he’s
hoping to sell it to a blacksmith. (A route-based scenario, see
here.)

Guildarch: The Noir Mantillas have stolen an adamantine anvil
from one of the smithies. (A mystery scenario, see here.)

As you can see, the district is a very flexible container. You can
key almost any type of scenario to it. The key content will usually
be contained within the district where it’s encountered, but
sometimes the district will only be where the scenario begins, with
the action potentially taking the PCs anywhere in the city (or even
beyond it).

URBANCRAWL LAYERS

In a basic urbancrawl you simply key each district with one piece
of content and you’re done: The urbancrawl is fully playable and the
PCs will be able to find adventure wherever they look.
You can think of this basic urbancrawl as a “layer” of content that
lies on top of the city gazetteer. It follows from this, however, that
you could actually key a city with multiple urbancrawls. Each ’crawl
acts as a separate layer and can be thought of as a sort of
“metascenario” or a themed collection of scenarios.
For example, you might key Anyoc with separate layers for:
Vampire blood dens

Noir Mantilla gang activities

Potential targets for lucrative heists

Patrons looking to hire the PCs for various jobs

Local contacts who could potentially be recruited by the PCs
Each layer would have interesting material keyed in every district
of the city, so if the PCs go poking around in Guildarch, for
example, they might find the local vampire den. Or get contacted by
agents of Lord Mekayle Ansella. Or run into Noir Mantillas harassing
local businesses. Or discover that a local merchant family holds the
Neferelli Diamond.
You could (and probably should) still have a “base layer” for the
city, which can serve as a catchall for content that doesn’t fit into a
citywide category. You can also, of course, add new layers to the

urbancrawl as the campaign progresses, while likely retiring layers
that are no longer useful (e.g., the PCs have killed all the vampires).

THE INVESTIGATION ACTION

How do the PCs actually access the content we’ve keyed to the
urbancrawl layers?
They investigate.
The generic investigation action is pretty straightforward: The
player points to a district and says, “I want to investigate there.”
Then you look at the urbancrawl key and you tell them what they
found:
“Keeping your ear to the ground in Guildarch, you hear the Noir
Mantillas have stolen an adamantine anvil. The smithies are
offering a rich reward for its return.”
“You’re in the university library when you hear a woman
screaming!”

“While making your way through the twisted streets of Noriv, a
small boy comes up and tugs on your coat. ‘Excuse me, sir,’ he
says. ‘But I remember you helping Almie get his cat out of a tree
last month. Now Almie’s missing and I don’t know what to do.’”
If you’re running an urbancrawl with multiple layers, then you
can randomly or arbitrarily choose which layer the PCs encounter.
The investigation action effectively creates (or triggers) a scenario
hook (see here), pulling or pushing the PCs into the scene or
scenario you’ve keyed to the district.
In practice, as the campaign evolves, the PCs will start poking
around the city with definite goals in mind. They’ll start saying
things like, “Let’s try to find the vampire den in Noriv” or “I’m going
to ask around Guildarch and see if I can get any leads on the Noir
Mantillas.” These are specific investigation actions, and they’re
resolved exactly like a generic investigation action except you don’t

randomize the layer they interact with—you just pull content from
the layer appropriate for whatever it is that they’re investigating.
(Although if the PCs are looking for something that isn’t there,
you might still resolve this as a generic action and have them
stumble across something else. Alternatively, if they’re looking for
stuff you haven’t prepped, that might be an indication that it’s time
to add a new layer to your urbancrawl.)
It’s also possible that the players will declare nonspecific
investigation actions, which can be either totally generic (“I
wander the city looking for something interesting to do”) or
topically targeted (“We’ll search the city for vampire dens”). When
this happens, the best thing to do is simply ask, “What district are
you starting in?” (or otherwise get them to focus on a specific
district). You can then resolve the investigation action normally.
While it can be good to let the players know that “pick a district
and see if there’s anything interesting there” is a default action that
they can always take in the campaign, I do recommend keeping the
separate layers of your urbancrawl as a player-unknown structure.
The players shouldn’t be saying things like, “I’d like some content
from the Heist urbancrawl layer, please.” You want them to be
saying, “We need another big score real bad. I’m going to hit up my
contacts in Kadbury and see if I can find something lucrative.”
In some or all cases, you may also want to add a mechanical
component to resolving an investigation action (like a Charisma
[Investigation] check). In other cases, there might be a monetary
cost (e.g., spreading gold around for bribes or hiring a sage).
Different layers, obviously, could have varying difficulties or costs
to access.
TRIGGERED DISTRICTS
In some cases, you might want to key an urbancrawl layer with
a triggered district. This just means that the PCs automatically
encounter the keyed content when they enter the district (or

perhaps have a random chance of doing so) and don’t need to
perform an investigation action.
In practical terms, the distinction between “random encounter”
and “triggered district” is often thin at best. You can get a
similar effect from either, so it will largely depend on what
seems to be most useful to you.

RUNNING THE URBANCRAWL

As I mentioned before, you’ll be running an urbancrawl as one part
in the grand tapestry of your city. The PCs will be discussing their
plans while sipping athsai at the Purple Lotus in the Kadbury district
and decide that they should try to find the vampire den in the Noriv
district.
The first thing they’ll have to do, obviously, is go from Kadbury to
Noriv. Using Life in the City (see here), you’ll mention the
landmarks they see along the way and make a scenic encounter
check. An encounter is indicated, so you roll one up and describe
the goblin urchins playing stickball in the street. (Do the PCs notice
that one of the urchins is picking their pocket?)
Now that they’re in Noriv, they can take their investigation
action. They’ve decided on two approaches: Granger is going to ask
among some of his underworld connections and Talbar is going to
talk to the local churches. The vampires are well hidden, so you’ve
assigned their urbancrawl layer DC 20. Granger rolls 15 on his
Charisma (Investigation) check and comes up empty (the criminals
down here take a real “it’s best to ignore it” attitude toward murder,
even—or particularly!—ones where the bodies have been drained of
blood), but Talbar rolls 22 on his Charisma (Religion) check and
finds a very frightened priest who can point them at the sewer
entrance he saw one of the creatures slither into as the sun was
dawning.
The PCs head into the sewers, raid the vampire den, and reemerge
several hours later covered in corpse dust and gore. They head back

to their rooms at the Purple Lotus to recuperate (so you can describe
another trip and check for another scenic encounter) and then take
care of some downtime activities.
In addition to the urbancrawl blood den layer, the vampires are
also a faction in Anyoc. You decide that the loss of the Noriv den
has set back their plans to conduct a dark ritual, so you erase a
segment of the clock, but you also decide to add a new four-segment
clock: Identify the PCs.
What will happen when the vampires figure out who’s been
targeting them?
We’ll play to find out!
DISCOVERING LAYERS
How do the PCs discover new urbancrawl layers to interact
with? For example, how do they first discover the vampire
blood dens in Anyoc so that they can start investigating and
raiding them?
There are actually lots of ways for this to happen:
A generic investigation action might have the PCs randomly
discover vampire activity.
The layer could feature a triggered district, so that the PCs
only need to enter that district to discover the layer.
A random encounter could feature vampires.

The faction actions of the vampires might create events that
hook the PCs.
The PCs might find clues (see here) in other scenarios,
pointing them toward a location or NPC on the layer.

SOCIAL EVENTS
Urban campaigns are filled with social events. It only makes sense
given the constant swirl of people through every nook and cranny of
the city.
Small social events are pretty straightforward: Grab a few NPCs,
throw them into a room with the PCs, and start roleplaying. Things
get trickier, though, as the size of the social events grows: How
many NPCs can you really roleplay at the same time? And how
many of them can the players really keep track of?
Which is a shame, because big social events are great set pieces
for any RPG campaign: They’re hotbeds of intrigue. If violence
needs to break out, the innocent bystanders raise the stakes. If
there’s to be a murder, they provide a wealth of suspects. If the PCs
are trying to pull a heist, they delightfully complicate the
proceedings.
They’re also a great way to escalate the stakes in a campaign and
signal that the PCs have changed their sphere of influence: You
rescued the mayor’s daughter from a dragon? Chances are you’re
going to be the belle of the ball, and you’re going to discover that
powerful and important people have become very interested in
making your acquaintance.
There are so many different social events like this you can run,
too:
Soiree on a flying ship

Dinner in a mystic castle

Journey on a long-haul space freighter
Political caucus

The royal masquerade

A jousting tournament

The pirate’s ball

A wizards’ conclave
The lunar regatta

Fortunately, there’s a very simple scenario structure you can use
to run these events. To use it, you’ll have to prep four tools: the
location, the guest list, the main event sequence, and the topics
of conversation.

LOCATION

Where is the social event taking place?
You’ve got a lot of flexibility with this. I’ve run these types of
events in everything from a simple ballroom to multiple airships
(with the event moving back and forth between vessels). What you
want to avoid, however, is making the location too small or too
simple. The key to any good party is having multiple zones of
activity, so that social groups can form and break apart freely.
Similarly, as we’ll see, what makes this scenario structure tick is the
PCs are not simultaneously engaged with every single NPC at the
event.
This doesn’t necessarily mean that you need lots and lots of
different rooms. Consider this tap room, for example:

It has a seating area, a bar, and a small private area. All of these
are within view of each other, but they’re distinct areas that people
can congregate in and move between.

On the other hand, it doesn’t hurt to incorporate a holistic
environment, either. For example, let’s zoom out a bit from that tap
room:
You could consider this five distinct areas:
Tap Room
Kitchen

Stable Yard
Stables

Entrance Gate
The essential distinction being that characters in one area can no
longer be seen from another and it will take more deliberate effort
to move between these locations or track down specific people. Of

course, while using this larger scope, you could still consider the tap
room at the heart of the event as three distinct areas on a smaller
scale.
Either way, including some specifically private areas can also be a
good idea, not just for the opportunities they provide the PCs to
seclude themselves, but because seeing NPCs slipping into or out of
such private areas can immediately invoke intrigue.

GUEST LIST

Next, you’ll want to prep the guest list. In my experience, you’ll
usually want ten to twenty people. Fewer than ten and the event
isn’t dynamic enough and doesn’t really feel “big.” More than
twenty and the lack of focus just devolves into noise. Fifteen or
thereabouts feels like a pretty good sweet spot to aim for.
Note that the event itself might be much larger than that! There
may be dozens or even hundreds of people there. But the guest list
you’re prepping is focusing on the circle of NPCs that are
immediately relevant to the PCs.
First, you’ll want to prep a master list of names to use as a quick
reference while running the event.
Next, prep notes for each of these important NPCs. I recommend
printing out one NPC per sheet and keeping them loose-leaf. That
will let you quickly pull out the sheets for each NPC participating in
a particular conversation for easy use. If you’ve got the time and
resources, it can also be rewarding to prep a visual handout for each
NPC. During each conversation, you can quickly display these,
making it easier for the players to track who they’re talking to and
enhancing their memory of each character as a separate individual.
(They’ll also serve as a handy visual reminder for you!)
I strongly recommend using the Universal Roleplaying Template
for these characters. This tool is presented in the Supporting Cast
extra credit on page 507 and is specifically designed to make it easy
for you to quickly pick up each NPC and seamlessly slip into their
role. If you’re using this template, the Key Info section is designed

for scenario-essential information. For social events, this could
include:
The character’s relationship with or attitude toward other NPCs.
(“Despises Susannah” or “Will enjoy swapping war stories with
the naval officers.”)

Specific reactions they might have to stimuli. (“Is angered by
anyone suggesting her father is dying.”)

Particular actions or interactions that should be triggered. (“Will
try to poison Cassandra’s drink” or “Wants to sell the PCs’
timeshares in Venice Beach.”)

Clues that can be gleaned from them. (“Knows the knife belonged
to Cassandra” or “DC 20 Wisdom [Perception] check to notice
that her dress has been torn.”)
Scenario hooks.

Cross-references or common experiences that they share with
particular PCs. (“Was raised in the same orphanage as Bella” or
“Was a friend to the duke they killed in Session 3.”)

Unusual or important gear they might be carrying. (“Her glass eye
allows her to see through walls” or “The golden cross she wears is
made of aurum [true gold].”)
Obviously some of these categories overlap with each other, and
there are plenty of other essential details that will be scenario- or
character-specific.

MAIN EVENT SEQUENCE

Now you’re going to prep the main event sequence for the event.
For example:
Announcing Guests of Special Honor
Merlin Appears

Galahad Arrives

Guinevere Arrives

The Green Knight Issues his Challenge
Duel of Verse

Argument Regarding Morgan le Fay
Debate of the Knights
Merlin’s Prophecy

Galahad and Gawain Seek Out the PCs
Guinevere’s Song

I usually prep these as a linear sequence (A happens, then B
happens, then C happens), but you can also
prep a grab bag of events that could happen in any sequence,
stock a random table and roll to see what happens next, or

prep multiple linear event tracks, swapping between them flexibly
as appropriate.
The PCs can also initiate alternative “major events,” or they may
end up derailing (or transforming) the events that you’d originally
planned. More power to them. The main event sequence should be
seen as a tool, not as destiny.
It can also be tempting to think of the main event sequence as the
Story of the Party™. But it isn’t. It’s more like the piece of string that
you dip in a saturated sugar solution to make rock candy. The
experience of the party—the cool and unique events that you and
your players are going to remember—will crystallize around the
string. If you’re eating the string instead of the candy, you’re doing
it wrong.

TOPICS OF CONVERSATION

The last tool to prep is the list of conversation topics. These might
be momentous recent events, fraught political debates, or just utter
trifles (like the series finale of a television program that aired last
night). An example from a campaign I ran included:

a recent riot

a magical battle that the PCs had been involved in

a string of terrorist attacks that had been plaguing the city
rumors of war to the south

the health of a guest who canceled at the last minute

a magical STD that had been afflicting merchant families

the recent prison escape by a criminal the PCs had arrested

a new restaurant that recently opened in the Nobles’ Quarter
I recommend mixing in a few “irrelevant” topics of conversation
to camouflage (or at least contrast) the “important” stuff.
The topics of conversation can also pick up elements from the
main event sequence as they happen. (“Did you see Astoria rush out
in tears? What could Rupert have possibly said to her?!”)
In some cases, you may want to reference topics of conversation
in the Key Info section of the NPCs from your guest list (i.e., what
they think about or can contribute to a particular topic), but for the
most part you’ll probably want to simply improvise what various
people have to say about each topic. What can be more useful than
prepping custom responses for every NPC, though, is figuring out
two or three different general viewpoints on a particular topic
(supporting the new Ironworkers’ Guild vs. thinking it’s a front for
criminal activity), and then you can just have each NPC ad-lib
within that debate.

RUNNING THE EVENT

To get the ball rolling, the first thing you’ll want to know is what
happens in the moment that the PCs show up for the event.
What will immediately attract their attention?
Who will they see?

Is there a major announcement (about them or otherwise)?

Is there something big and loud going down?

Is there something subtle that only they might notice?
This will generally be the first event on your main event
sequence. It’s the initial hook and it should give the players enough
context to begin taking action in the scene—reacting to what they
see, going to speak to someone they know, etc.
From that point forward, running the event is largely a matter of
picking up the various toys you’ve built and putting them into play
in different configurations.
Which NPCs are talking to each other? (Consult your guest list.)
What are they talking about? (Look at your topics of
conversation.)

Who might come over and join a conversation the PCs are
having? (Again, guest list.)
Encourage the PCs to split up. Cutting back and forth between
various conversations is extremely effective in large social events,
and you’ll want to use crossovers (see here) between various
interactions to make the party feel like a unified whole. (For
example, if one of the PCs gets involved in a huge shouting match
with the Barundian diplomat, the other PCs should either hear it
directly or hear people talking about it.)
Keep the social groups circulating. You don’t have to completely
use up everything interesting about a particular NPC in a single
interaction. In fact, you shouldn’t. Reincorporate characters that the
PCs met earlier in the event. Similarly, reincorporate topics of
conversation—let the players discuss similar things with different
people in order to get (and argue) different points of view.
Pay attention to which NPCs “click” with the players (whether in
a positive or negative way). In my experience, there’s really no way
to predict this: Part of it is just random chance. Part of it is which
character traits particularly appeal to your players. Part of it will be
which NPCs are clicking for you (and therefore providing stronger
and more memorable interactions). Regardless, make a point of

bringing those NPCs back and developing the PCs’ relationships
with them.
If things feel like they’re lagging, either cut to another group of
PCs or trigger the next event in the main event sequence.
Don’t hog the driver’s seat. Allow the PCs to observe things that
they can then choose to react to. (For example, instead of having
every NPC come to them, allow them to notice NPCs walking past or
overhear a group talking about a topic of interest. Let them choose
whether and how to engage.) Make a point of asking them what
they want to do (and, if they don’t have an answer, trigger the next
event).
What essentially makes this scenario structure work is that you
have not prepped a dozen specific interactions for the PCs to have.
Instead, you’ve prepped a couple dozen different toys—people,
topics, events—and you’re going to constantly remix them into new
configurations for as long as they hold the players’ interest.

QUICK-AND-DIRTY SOCIAL EVENTS

The full scenario structure presented here obviously requires
preparation to run to full effect. But what if the PCs have just
spontaneously decided to crash the society debut of the governor’s
daughter? Is there any way to use this scenario structure on the fly?
Here’s the 5-minute version for emergency use:
Make a list of three to five places people can congregate.
Make a list of ten characters.
Make a list of five events.

Make a list of five topics of conversation.
Don’t go into detail. Just list ’em.
If this social event is growing organically out of game play, then
you’ve probably already got the NPCs and the topics of conversation
prepped—you just need to pull them into the lists for this event.

Finally, if the PCs are going to the social event to achieve some
specific goal, figure out three ways they can do that and notate it in
the appropriate places (whether the location keys, the event track,
the guest descriptions, or the topics of conversation).
For example, if they’re trying to figure out who in the Governor’s
circle of friends might have assassinated Marco’s sister, you might
identify a couple guests who can point them in the right direction
and maybe one of the events is an opportunity to witness the
Governor’s chief of staff slipping off to talk to a known gangster. Of
course, when you’re actually running the event, the PCs may
discover a bunch of other ways to accomplish their goal. Follow
their lead.

ONCE YOU STEP outside the walls of the city or dungeon, you’ll
find yourself confronted by the wilderness.

It’s a dangerous business, Frodo, going out of your door. You step into
the Road, and if you don’t keep your feet, there is no knowing where
you might be swept off to. Do you realize that this is the very path that
goes through Mirkwood … or even further and to worse places?
—Bilbo, The Lord of the Rings (J. R. R. Tolkien)
One wilderness can be quite different from another, however. It
depends on where you are and also what you’re trying to do there.
Some wildernesses are quite tame, having been domesticated by
roads and towns and suchlike. Others are anything but, turning even
basic navigation into a challenge and inviting only the bold to
explore their savage depths. Do you have a map? Are you sticking to
the road? What dangers lurk among the trees or prey upon unwary
travelers?
So as your campaign enters the wilderness, the first thing you—
and your players—will have to figure out is what you want the
wilderness to be. Or, to put it another way, why (and how) you’re
going there.
One way of looking at the wilderness is as the obstacle between
where you are and where you want to go. It’s the challenge that
interrupts your vector and must be overcome to achieve your goal.
(Even if your goal is just, “I want to get to the next village.”)
Another way of thinking about the wilderness is that it’s a map
with keyed adventure sites. In this mode, it acts almost like a menu
that the PCs can order their next scenario from. (Even though
sometimes they’ll be “reading” that menu with a blindfold on.)
Another is a playground, where the wilderness itself is the
adventure. Here the map works more like the map of a dungeon,
linking individual experiences and challenges that can be
encountered through navigational choices.

In addition to being varied, the nature of the wilderness is also
ever-shifting. It can—and almost certainly will—change over the
course of a campaign, depending on the current goals of the PCs,
their location, and the evolution of current events.
So as we step into the wild together, I won’t be showing you the
One True Way™ of running the wilderness, because that doesn’t
exist. Instead, we’ll look at a constellation of options you can use.
Routes (see here), for when the PCs are heading from Point A to
Point B.
Hexcrawls (see here), for campaigns focused on exploration,
particularly on the edges of civilization.
Pointcrawls (see here), for exploration in regions with more
established routes of travel.

There is, perhaps unsurprisingly, a fair degree of overlap between
these different structures. In fact, it’s not unusual to use all three
simultaneously as different “layers” or ways of interacting with a
specific region. So whichever structure would be most useful for
your current needs, it will probably still make the most sense to
start by reading through this section from beginning to end (as
concepts are introduced, for example, in the discussion of hexcrawls
that will later be referenced for pointcrawls).

WATCHES
No matter how you’re traveling through the wilderness, you’ll need
to keep track of time and movement. A watch is the basic unit for
tracking time and actions while traveling through the wilderness,

and is used regardless of whether you’re using routes, a hexcrawl, or
a pointcrawl. Each watch is equal to 4 hours, which means there are
six watches per day. During each watch, a character can take one
watch action. The type of watch action taken by a traveler will
determine what type of watch it is for them.
There are three types of watches:
Active
Rest

Travel
It’s generally assumed that travelers are spending two watches per
day traveling, two watches per day resting, and two watches per day
engaged in other activities.
The rules below are designed for use with the current edition of
D&D, but the mechanical structure should be relatively easy to
adapt to other roleplaying games as needed.
FORCED MARCH
If a character spends more than two watches traveling in one day,
they must make a Constitution saving throw each hour (DC 10 + 1
per hour of additional travel). On a failure, they suffer one level of
exhaustion.
LACK OF SLEEP
If a character does not spend at least one full watch per day resting,
they must succeed at a Constitution saving throw (DC 16 - the
number of hours they slept, if any) or suffer a level of exhaustion.
STANDING ORDERS
It’s often a good idea to get an expedition’s “standing orders” (e.g.,
who’s navigating? who’s riding sentinel?) instead of asking everyone
to declare their watch action during every single watch. If the ranger
has been doing the navigating for the last 8 days, he’s probably

going to continue navigating for the next 4 hours and you don’t
need to bog things down by confirming that.

TRAVELING

While taking a travel watch action, a traveler chooses a travel pace
(see here) and can move up to a maximum distance determined by
that pace and any speed modifiers inflicted by travel conditions
(see here) or terrain (see here). Speed modifiers (e.g., ¾ speed, ½
speed, etc.) are applied by simply multiplying the base speed by the
modifier.
TRAVEL PACE
Travelers can choose one of four paces of travel.
Normal: An expedition traveling at normal pace cannot use
Stealth checks to avoid detection.
Slow: While moving at a slow pace, the expedition is being
purposefully careful. An expedition traveling at slow pace:
Gains advantage on navigation checks.

Can make Stealth checks to avoid detection.
Has its chance for a non-exploratory encounter halved. (If a nonexploratory encounter is generated, there is a 50% chance it
doesn’t actually happen.)
Exploration: While exploring, an expedition is assumed to be
trying out side trails, examining objects of interest, and so forth.
While exploring, an expedition:
Can’t use Stealth checks to avoid detection.
Gains advantage on navigation checks.
Has its chance for encounters doubled.

Fast: While moving quickly through the wilderness, an expedition
traveling at fast pace:

Can’t use Stealth checks to avoid detection.

Suffers disadvantage to Wisdom (Perception) checks.
Suffers a -5 penalty to navigation checks.

Leading Pack Animal: Under normal circumstances, a packpuller can lead a file with a number of animals equal to their
passive Wisdom (Animal Handling) skill.
Poor Visibility: This condition also gives disadvantage to
navigation and forage checks.

River Crossing: This penalty applies to any watch during which a
river must be crossed. This does not apply if the characters are
following a road that has a bridge on it, but does apply if they’re
traveling cross-country and must seek out a bridge.

TERRAIN
The type of terrain an expedition is moving through modifies the
speed at which they can travel.
Highway: A highway is a straight, major, paved road.
Road: A road is a dirt track or similar causeway.

Trail: A trail is an irregular byway. Probably unsuitable for most
vehicles and may only allow for single-file travel. Most off-road
travel follows local trails. A known trail does not usually require
navigation checks, although a known trail in poor repair requires
a DC 10 navigation check to follow.
Trackless: Trackless terrain is a wild area with no paths. +2 to
navigation DCs.

WATCH ACTION
WATCH ACTION: FORAGER
Characters can forage during an active watch or while traveling at
slow pace. Foragers make a Wisdom (Survival) check against the
Forage DC of the terrain (see here). On a success, the forager either
gains 1 ration of food or finds a source of fresh water (allowing the
expedition to drink their daily ration of water and waterskins to be
refilled). An additional ration of food or source of fresh water can be
found for every two points by which the check result exceeds the
DC.
FOOD & WATER
Food: Small or Medium creatures require 1 ration of food per
day. They can go without food for a number of days equal to 3

+ their Constitution modifier (minimum 1) before suffering 1
exhaustion level per day thereafter. A normal day of eating
resets the count of days without food to zero. A creature on half
rations counts as going a half day without food (and these half
days accumulate until they can eat full rations).
Water: Small or Medium creatures require 1 gallon of water
per day, or twice that in hot weather. A creature on a half
ration of water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution check at
the end of each day or suffer a level of exhaustion. If they drink
less water than that, they suffer a level of exhaustion
automatically. If the character already has one or more levels of
exhaustion, the character takes two levels instead of one level
in either case. Waterskins hold a half ration of water.
Recovery: Any exhaustion suffered from lack of food or water
cannot be removed until after a full day of normal
consumption.
Large and Tiny Creatures: Tiny creatures require one-quarter
ration of food and water per day. Large creatures (like horses)
require four rations of food and water per day.
WATCH ACTION: MAKE CAMP
During an active watch, a character can establish a camp suitable
for four creatures if they have tents or similar equipment to shelter
them. (Horses and similar creatures do not require tents, but must
still be accounted for in camp preparations.) If the expedition does
not have equipment for shelter, the character can only establish a
camp suitable for one creature (either themselves or someone else)
per watch action. Multiple characters can, of course, work together
to make a larger camp.
WATCH ACTION: NAVIGATOR

During a travel watch, the expedition’s navigator is responsible for
making navigation checks. A second navigator can assist, granting
advantage to the navigation checks.
WATCH ACTION: PACK-PULLER
A pack-puller is responsible for managing an expedition’s pack
animals during a travel watch. A pack-puller can lead a number of
animals equal to their passive Wisdom (Animal Handling) score.
(This number includes the pack-puller’s mount, if any.)
WATCH ACTION: RESTING
A character must take the Resting action for two rest watches in a
row in order to gain the benefits of a Long Rest. (See the rules for
Long Rests in the D&D rulebooks regarding which types of
interruptions are possible without disrupting the Resting action.)
Characters without a proper camp or similar conditions (e.g., a
roadside inn) require an additional Resting action to gain the
benefits of resting. (In other words, it would take them three Resting
actions in a row to gain the benefits of a Long Rest.)
WATCH ACTION: SCOUTING
A scout can be sent out to chart a course or learn the lay of the land
during an active watch or, if they are traveling at a speed faster
than the rest of the expedition, during a travel watch. When
scouting, a character can choose one of two actions:
Reporting: If the navigator receives a scout’s report, they gain
advantage on their navigation checks during the next travel
watch.

Pathfinding: The scout attempts a Wisdom (Survival) check using
the area’s Navigation DC. On a success, the expedition can treat
trackless terrain as if it had a trail for the next travel watch.
If encounter checks are being made, an additional encounter
check is made for each scouting group. (They are effectively a
separate expedition while engaged in scouting.)

WATCH ACTION: SENTINEL
A member of an expedition acting as a sentinel during any watch
can make Wisdom (Perception) checks and use their passive Wisdom
(Perception) score to detect threats or notice anything else out of
the ordinary.
WATCH ACTION: TRACKER
A Tracker can either find tracks or follow tracks as a watch action.
Finding Tracks: Searching a significant wilderness area for tracks
is an active watch action. The tracker makes a Wisdom
(Perception) check against the appropriate Track DC.
Following Tracks: Once tracks have been found, a tracker can
follow the trail during a travel watch by making Wisdom
(Survival) checks against the appropriate Track DC. A new check
must be made each time the trail enters a new hex (or once per
watch if not using a hexmap). If a trail is lost, it may be possible
to reacquire it using the Finding Tracks action.

WATCH ACTION: OTHER ACTIONS
This list of watch actions should cover the most essential activities
for organizing and managing an overland journey, but the road is
long and there are many forms of mischief that the PCs can get up
to. This is particularly true around the campfire at night. If a PC
takes an action that feels like it would take at least an hour or two
of focused attention, that probably counts as a watch action.
The PCs may also make pit stops: buying supplies in a village.
Exploring a dungeon they stumble across. Resting at the Nuinë
Springs. You can assume that any such stop takes at least one watch
action, although in some cases the break from traveling may be long
enough that you’re effectively just putting the journey on hold until
the PCs resume it.
PREPARING SPELLS
In D&D, you’ll need to decide whether a caster needs to spend an
active watch preparing their spells or if that can be bundled into a
Resting watch action. The amount of time required tends to be fairly
low for a full watch of activity, but it’s an activity that requires
focused attention, so you can make the argument either way.

A JOURNEY OF 1,000 DAYS ON ALIEN WORLDS!
What if the PCs are traveling on an alien world where there are
only 16 hours per day? Or what if you want to run a mega-epic
journey that lasts for 1,000 days? Do you really need to resolve
6,000 watches of activity one by one?
Well … no. For extraordinary expeditions or environments,
you’d want to adapt the guidelines given here. Similarly,

although the specific mechanics described here are for D&D,
the structures can be easily adapted to other roleplaying games.

ROUTES
Let’s imagine that the players are in the city of Kingsdeep and they
need to go to the border town of Maernath to study the ancient
crypt of the founder of the Verdigris Order. How does that trip play
out at the table?
The first option is the easiest: Skip it. Look at your map to figure
out the distance between Kingsdeep and Maernath, consult the table
of wilderness travel speeds to calculate how long the trip will take,
and then say something like, “Okay, having journeyed northwest
across the Great Basin, you arrive in Maernath on the seventeenth.”
There’s nothing wrong with this approach. It’s often exactly the
right way to handle travel. You’ve determined that there are no
interesting choices to be made during the journey, so you’re framing
past that empty time (see here) to the next set of interesting choices.
But this may also leave you feeling vaguely unsatisfied. Among
other things, you might remember any number of fantasy stories
you’ve read or watched in which journeying from one location to
another is a significant feature of the narrative and feel like you’re
missing out on an opportunity. (These stories aren’t limited to
fiction, either. Xenophon’s March of the Ten Thousand would be
really boring if the Anabasis was just, “We left Cunaxa and, long
story short, we were back in Greece two years later.”) Travel is an
opportunity to expand your game world and create novel
experiences for your players.

CHOOSING A ROUTE

When beginning a new journey, the first thing the PCs must do is
choose which route they’re going to use. This choice is only
possible, of course, if the PCs know what routes they can use and
where they’re going. They might gain that information from things
like
maps,

local guides,

mystical assistance, or
personal experience.

If the PCs don’t know of any routes from where they are to where
they want to go (and can’t find one before departing), then what
they’re actually doing is exploring and you’re going to want to use a
hexcrawl (see here) or pointcrawl (see here).
In order for the choice of routes to be interesting, there must be
some meaningful distinction between them. “Meaningful” in this
case means that it’s something that the PCs care about.
This can include stuff like:
Speed: One route is faster than the other. (You’ll always need to
calculate how long each route will take to travel in any case.)
Difficulty: One route is more difficult to navigate. It might
require special knowledge, special tools, or special skills to
successfully traverse. (E.g., climbing through the mountains or
being able to answer the riddle of the gate-sphinx.)

Stealth: One route will make it easier for the PCs to avoid
detection. This can either be in general or a particular route that
might make it more difficult for one specific NPC or faction to
detect them. (You can also conceptually invert this and think of it
as a route making the PCs vulnerable to detection from a
particular faction: If you take the High Road you might be pressganged by the king’s army. On the other hand, the army’s

recruiters don’t go into the Bloodfens, but if you go that way
you’ll be at risk from the goblin rovers instead.)

Expense: The cost of traveling the route. (This can be as simple as
the price of a ticket.)
Advantageous Landmarks: A route can have beneficial pit stops
along the way, making it potentially more appealing than other
options. (E.g., visiting the Oracle of Delphi or seeing an old
friend.)
Hazards: Conversely, there might be a significant hazard along
one of the routes. (You can enter Mordor this way, but you’ll
have to figure out some way past Minas Morgul.)

In order for this to be a choice rather than a calculation, the two
routes must be distinguished by at least two incomparable
characteristics that the PCs care about.
PLAYER: How can we get from Kingsdeep to Oathsaken?

GM: You can take the High Road or you can travel by sea.
PLAYER: What’s the difference?
GM: Well, you’ll get there faster by sea.

This is obviously not a choice. It’s a calculation: The routes are
identical except for the speed at which the PCs will get to
Oathsaken, and so they’ll take the route that is faster. But if you
instead say, “Well, it’s faster to sail, but there are reports of pirates
hitting ships in Carmine Bay,” this is no longer a calculation.
Instead, the PCs have to choose whether speed or safety is more
important to them.
One solid set of incomparables is all you need for this to work,
but you can always add more (and you’ll generally find them arising
naturally out of the given circumstances of the game world in any
case). Watch out, though! There’s a risk that you can inadvertently
turn the choice back into a calculation as you add complexity. For
example, you might say:

The sea route is faster and is dangerous due to pirates.

The High Road is slower and is dangerous because of orc bandits.
If the pirates and bandits are known to be equally hazardous, then
you’re back to a straight-up calculation: There’s equal danger on
both routes and one route is faster.
(This doesn’t happen if the PCs can’t be sure of the relative hazard
posed by the pirates and bandits. In that scenario it becomes an
incomplete information problem, in which a calculation is turned
into a choice because the player lacks the information necessary to
make the calculation. Basically, they have to trust their gut: Do they
think the pirates are more dangerous than the bandits and, if so,
how much more dangerous and is that worth the extra speed?)
This is also why the PCs need to care about the distinction
between routes. If speed isn’t actually important to them (e.g., they
need to be there before June and either route will get them there by
April), then Faster + Hazardous vs. Slower + Safer is still just a
calculation, this time of which route is safer.
The point here is not, necessarily, to create stuff to make a
particular route a viable choice. Just recognize that it’s not a choice
and don’t present it as such (or explain why it isn’t if the players are
curious for some reason). For example, if you’re trying to get from
Chicago to Indianapolis, you wouldn’t consider “first drive to St.
Louis, then turn around and drive back to Indianapolis” as an
option. (Because why would you?)
So while there will likely be many possible routes that the PCs
could hypothetically take, in practice only a few of these (possibly
just one of them) will be a meaningful route—i.e., a route that the
PCs might have some reason for choosing. These are the routes that
you’ll need to design for play.

DESIGNING A ROUTE

A route is fundamentally defined by a sequence of landmarks that
are spaced along its length. These might be permanent structures
(cities, statues, bridges, etc.) or they might be programmed

encounters that only apply to this particular journey (a brokendown wagon, an ambush by orc bandits, etc.). Either way, these
landmarks will be encountered at specific points along the route.
Routes may also have features, the most common of which is a
speed modifier. If there’s a chance of getting lost while following
the route, then it would also include a Navigation DC. Some routes
might also have bespoke features, like a faerie road that can only be
followed if you wear a sprig of mistletoe in your hair.
At your discretion, you might also design a random encounter
table for the route. These are made in the same fashion as the
random encounter tables for a dungeon (see here), although
obviously the nature of the encounters will depend on the nature of
the route.
ROUTES THROUGH HEXCRAWLS
Random encounters are a good example of how the different
structures for wilderness play can overlap with each other. If a route
passes through a region you’ve already designed as a hexcrawl, for
example, you could easily use the region’s existing random
encounter table.
CROSS-ROUTE ELEMENTS
One drawback of the route system is the choice between multiple
routes, which creates a Choose Your Own Adventure structure in
which you can end up wasting your time prepping a bunch of
material for routes that the PCs don’t take.
There are a few ways to mitigate this in practice, however.
First, there may not actually be a choice between multiple routes.
In any situation where the choice of route boils down to a
calculation, as we’ve discussed, the only route you’ll need to worry
about is the best route.
Second, you can often minimize wasted prep by having the
players choose their route at the end of a session. You’ll still need to
broadly prep each route so that a meaningful choice can be made

between routes, but this is fairly minimal and the details only need
to be prepped for the route that’s actually chosen. (In other words,
you need to be able to say “there are pirates in Carmine Bay” for the
PCs to make their choice, but you only need to actually prep pirate
ships and pirate stats if the PCs choose the sea route.)
Third, if the PCs are repeatedly traveling through the same area
over the course of the campaign, it becomes more likely that they’ll
take different routes at different times, which allows you to
eventually use the material you prepped for those other routes.
Fourth, material can be prepped that applies to multiple routes.
There are several forms these cross-route elements can take.
Traveling companions are a good example. If the PCs are
traveling with a larger group, then that group will go with them
regardless of which route they choose. You can prep various
roleplaying interactions or even full scenarios (like a murder
mystery, for example), so that the PCs literally carry the adventure
with them.
Hunters, i.e., bad guys who are pursuing the PCs, are another
easy example. Think about the Nazgûl of Middle Earth or the
Terminator cyborgs. Whether the PCs take the road to Rivendell or
leave it to go via Weathertop, you’ll still be able to actively play the
Black Riders as a threat.
Broadly speaking, you’re looking for proactive elements that can
come to (or come with) the PCs no matter where they go. You may
also note that these elements can also make the choice of route
more interesting, just as the Ringwraiths forced the hobbits—and
later Strider—to make a number of route choices balancing speed,
safety, and stealth.

ADVANCED ROUTES
If once we shake off pursuit, I shall make for Weathertop … It is a
hill, just to the north of the Road, about halfway from here to
Rivendell … Gandalf will make for that point, if he follows us. After

Weathertop our journey will become more difficult, and we shall have
to choose between various dangers.
—Aragorn, The Lord of the Rings (J. R. R. Tolkien)
The basic route system described above assumes that the route
follows a clear and unmistakable path—a road or river, for example.
Some routes don’t follow paths, however. These unpathed routes
generally take the form of a landmark chain: Head north to Archet,
then turn east to Weathertop. Turn south from Weathertop, cross
the road, and then head west until you hit the road again.
To handle unpathed routes, you’ll need mechanics for (a) getting
lost, (b) realizing that you’re lost, and (c) getting back on track after
you become lost.
Hidden route elements are those unknown to the PCs before they
begin their journey: The gansōm bridge was washed out by the
spring floods, releasing howling water spirits into the
Nazharrow River. Before arriving in the Bloodfens, the PCs were
unaware of the presence of goblin rovers. They’re pleasantly
surprised to discover that the Imperial checkpoint at the Karnic
crossroads has been abandoned, its regiment summoned north
to deal with peasant rebellions.
These elements can include both landmarks and features. They
are often something that cannot be known before the journey begins
(barring extraordinary effort), but in other cases the PCs may have
just not done their research. Although I mentioned before that the
PCs need to be aware of distinctions between available routes, that
doesn’t necessarily mean that they need to know everything.
Forked routes feature route choices that are made after the
journey has already begun. These can include detours, in which
the fork in the route eventually collapses back into the original
route.
Detours are often made in response to hidden route features
discovered along the way (e.g., the gansōm bridge has been washed
out, so you need to figure out a different way across the river). PCs
can be both pushed and pulled by detours, however: In addition to

trying to avoid bad things on the original route, they might also
choose to turn aside to gain some benefit (from an advantageous
landmark, for example), usually at the cost of time.

RUNNING A ROUTE

Routes are run by the watch. Every character gets to choose one
watch action per watch, you resolve the actions while introducing
any events or landmarks encountered along the way, and then you
start a new watch and do it again.
During each watch:
1. Mark the watch and tick durations and daily resources (food,
water, etc.).
2. Make an encounter check.
3. Declare watch actions.
4. Resolve travel by:
A. Declaring pace.
B. Making a navigation check.
C. Tracking movement on the route map.
5. Resolve encounters, including Perception-type checks (which
may interrupt travel).
6. Resolve other watch actions.
Unlike the dungeon turn (see here), which I’ve found generally
works best as a player-unknown structure, overland travel seems to
work best when players are aware that time is being tracked in
watches and are able to select the specific watch actions that they’re
taking.

TRACKING TIME

With a little practice, you’ll find that most watches get resolved very
quickly. I recommend tracking the passage of watches using tally

marks, beginning a new grouping of marks at the end of each day.
(That way you won’t have to track multiples of six to know which
day you’re on: You can just count tally groups.)
In practice, the members of an expedition will usually be mostly
unified in the type of watch actions they’re taking: They’ll all travel
together for a couple of watches, make camp, and then do a little
shuffling of active and rest actions to make sure a watch is kept.
This can be made routine with standard marching order (see here),
and usually the most important question will be who’s on watch
when an encounter happens.
There are only a handful of spells and abilities that have a
duration longer than one watch, but you’ll want to track those with
ticks just as you would while running a dungeon (see here).
Usually of more importance are daily resources, like rations and
water. If the PCs are traveling along a road with regular inns or
similar services, this can likely be ignored. When supplies do
become important, it’s generally best to have one person at the table
be responsible for tracking them. That’s something you can do as
the GM, of course, but it’s often more efficient to have a specific
player as the expedition’s quartermaster. If the latter, make sure to
clearly communicate the passage of days to them so that they can
tick supply usage.

ROUTE ENCOUNTERS

Making an encounter check while traveling is resolved using the
same procedure as dungeon encounter checks (see here), except for

the encounter distance:
Open Vistas: 2d6 x 60 feet

Obstructed Visibility: 2d6 x 20 feet
Limited Visibility: 2d6 x 10 feet

Because watches tend to be resolved really quickly, you can save
a lot of time at the table by making all of the encounter checks for a
single day at the same time. Instead of rolling a single d8, roll six
eight-sided dice at the same time and read their results from left to
right (for the first watch of the day, the second watch of the day,
and so forth). Mark which watches will have an encounter and then
begin generating them. (You can often do this while the players are
making navigation checks, discussing their options during a
previous encounter, or the like.)
WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN?
If you want to randomly determine a specific time within a watch,
roll 1d8 to determine the half hour. You can get even more specific
by rolling a d30 to determine the exact minute within the half hour.

ROUTE NAVIGATION

While traveling, the navigator should declare the expedition’s travel
pace.
If the expedition is following a road, river, or similarly obvious
path, no navigation check is required. If the route is unpathed,
however, the navigator must make a navigation check—a Wisdom
(Survival) check with a difficulty determined by the terrain they’re
traveling through (see here). The terrain-based DC assumes that
there are local trails that are being followed, but in a trackless
waste, add +2 to Navigation DCs.
If the navigation check is failed, the expedition has become lost.
Begin counting the number of watches the expedition has been lost

for and continue making navigation checks during each watch. On
the next successful check, the navigator will realize that they’ve
become lost. Assume that the expedition must spend as many
watches backtracking to return to the correct route as they spent
lost in the first place (although, if additional navigation checks are
failed, they could end up becoming lost again).
In addition to being lost, groups failing navigation checks may
suffer other complications, such as
ending up somewhere they didn’t want to be,

encountering a regional hazard like quicksand or the black
vapors,
an increased risk of random encounters, or

discovery by enemies they were seeking to avoid.
The appropriate complication, if any, will depend on the current
situation and is at your discretion.
If the navigation check succeeds, or was not needed, on the other
hand, use the group’s travel pace to determine how far they moved
along their route. This may, of course, include encountering one or
more landmarks.

THE TRAVELOGUE

A route is not inherently interesting. It’s the experiences that you fill
the journey with that will make it entertaining and memorable.
(This is just like a dungeon: Moving through some lines drawn on
graph paper isn’t inherently interesting, either. It’s what you key
into the dungeon rooms that make or break the experience.)
By default, the route system will lead you toward a generic
travelogue (“… and then we went to X and then we went to Y and
then we went to …”). But the best travelogues find ways to elevate
the sequence of events. You want your game to resonate with the
vibes of a great road trip movie or the epic journeys of The Lord of
the Rings.

You might think about what kind of story you want the journey to
be: exploration, a race, escape, survival, self-discovery, edification.
Or is the journey simply a convenient framing device for a bunch of
individually interesting and complete short stories? Journeys can set
mood (think of the emotional toll of Frodo and Sam’s long trek
across Mordor), emphasize a theme (sure are a lot of goblins in
these fens), reinforce current quests (passing caravans of refugees
from the war), or provide hooks to side quests.
As you describe a journey, your travelogue will include pit stops
and passage.
Pit stops are the landmarks and encounters that are framed into
full-fledged scenes and played out as scenes. (Or, in some cases,
across multiple scenes.) These are travelers you meet along the way
and roleplay a conversation with or the small roadside shrine where
the PCs might choose to make an offering, but it’s also the
significant challenges—like a washed-out bridge or even a full
dungeon—that they encounter along the way.
The passage, on the other hand, is how you describe the journey
between each pit stop. This can also include landmarks (“You pass
by the Red Spire of Anauroch around mid-afternoon, and then by
dusk …”), but will largely be painted in broader strokes (“You enter
the cool shadows beneath the gabled boughs of Silverwood, a
blessed relief from the scorching sunlight”).
When we talked about describing dungeon rooms, we had some
rules of thumb for creating awesome descriptions (see here):
Three of Five

Two Cool Details
Three-by-Three

Even though the passages of a travelogue are vastly different in
scope and purpose from the rooms of a dungeon, it turns out these
same rules of thumb will continue to serve us well in describing
them: Invoke multiple senses, add a couple cool details, and sprinkle
your descriptions with a little depth.

To make the journey truly come to life, you’ll also want to make
sure that the players have an opportunity to actually play through
the experience. Some of this will come from the pit stops, but you’ll
also want to frame roleplaying opportunities between the PCs. A
good way to do this is to simply listen for the moments when the
players at the table are talking to each other—whether they’re
planning their next move, checking their supplies, or speculating
about who the Faceless Riders work for—and interject a frame for
where and how that conversation is happening in the game world:
chatting while they ride their horses side by side. Gathered around
the campfire at night. Huddled inside their tents while the blizzard
rages outside.
You may also get good results from periodically prompting the
players with an open-ended roleplaying opportunity. For example,
you might say, “After making camp, you gather around the fire for
your dinner. What do you talk about?” Or even make it more
specific by asking something like, “Cleotha, what tale do you tell to
entertain your companions?” This sort of thing will become quite
taxing if you try to do it every single time the PCs make camp, but
applied as a light spice it can have great results.
DO I NEED THIS ROUTE AT ALL?
If you’re having difficulty making a route interesting, it might be a
good time to take a step back and say, “Should we skip this?” If a
route is boring, it’s probably because there are no meaningful
choices being made. If no meaningful choices are being made, you
should probably cut forward to the point where interesting choices
will be made.

HOMEWORK
THE ROUTE MAP
The next time the PCs need to go to an adventure site in your
campaign, prep the journey as a route.
STEP 1: IDENTIFY THE ROUTE
Look at the map of your campaign world. Where are the PCs now
and where are they going to?
Is there a road, river, or trail they could follow?
Can they get there by boat?

What about exotic methods such as an airship or magic portal?
If you don’t have a map yet, this is a great time to start one: Grab
a blank sheet of paper, then write down the PCs’ current location in
one spot and the location they’re going to in another spot. Select a
type of route (road, river, train tracks, etc.) and use it to connect the
two locations.
I WANT MORE MAPS!
If you’d rather get started with a more elaborated map, check out
the Quick-and-Dirty Worldbuilding extra credit (see here) and also
the guide to making hexmaps (see here).
STEP 2: ADD LANDMARKS
Define the route by listing the landmarks the PCs will encounter
while traveling along it. If you’re referencing an existing map, it will

likely provide some of these landmarks for you (river crossings,
villages, etc.). Start with those and then fill in the gaps.
If these are new landmarks, you may want to add some or all of
them to your map for future reference.
Some of these landmarks may only be mentioned as scenery
during the travelogue, but if you’re focusing on a particular journey
I recommend including at least one or two landmarks that are more
interactive and can form the basis for a small scene. On the other
hand, for your first route I’d keep things fairly simple and probably
cap the interactive landmarks at no more than three or four.
STEP 3: ADD ENCOUNTERS
Finally, add encounters and an encounter table, whether bespoke or
procedurally generated. (Remember that you can borrow existing
regional encounter tables if you’ve got them!) Since this is likely a
relatively short route, you probably don’t need more than a handful
of encounters, unless it’s a site the PCs are likely to be visiting
repeatedly.
RE—RUNNING A ROUTE
Even if the PCs aren’t going back and forth to this adventuring
site, you’ll likely use this route at least once more when the PCs
head home.
When this happens, pay attention to the transitory landmarks:
the wagon with a broke wheel. The farmers bringing in the
harvest. The traveling bard who offers to sing them a song for a
silver piece.
These transitory landmarks won’t repeat, so you’ll need to
remove them and will likely want to replace them with new
transitory landmarks. (Unless transitory content like this is
tightly tied to a specific location, you might also want to think
about encoding it into your encounter table, where it’s easier to
manage.)

THE SECOND ROUTE
When you’re ready (or the opportunity naturally presents itself), you
can offer the players a choice between two different routes.
Step 1: Identify the Routes: This is usually easier if the two
routes are of different types (e.g., by road or by sail), but this
isn’t strictly necessary. Add the locations and routes to your map
if they aren’t there already.

Step 2: Create the Choice: Choose a characteristic that would be
significant to the PCs from the list of examples on page 376 and
make one of the routes better (e.g., taking the airship is faster
than riding along the road). Then pick a different characteristic
and make it advantageous for the other route (e.g., a ticket on the
airship is expensive, but riding on the road is free).
Step 3: Make the Choice: Present the two options to the players
and let them choose which route they want to take. You can then
prep that route using the procedure above.

THE ROUTE MAP
Over time, if your campaign regularly features travel, you’ll begin to
accumulate a collection of routes that crisscross the local region. It’s
likely, in fact, that this route map will evolve into a pointcrawl (see
here): As the routes intersect and overlap with each other, the map
will develop enough depth that the players can make complex
navigational decisions and begin charting their own routes in detail.
For example, months ago the PCs passed through Black Larch on
their way from Kingsdeep to Maernath. Later they went from
Maernath to Oathsaken, a trip that also took them through Black
Larch. Now they want to go from Oathsaken to Kingsdeep … and
the route already exists! You just need to patch together pieces of
the two previous routes.
It may be tempting to imagine sitting down and planning this
elaborate route map ahead of time as part of your campaign prep.
But while there may be a few major, obvious routes where it would

make sense to do this, for the most part I recommend resisting the
temptation. Partly because the thought of all that wasted prep
makes the little winged GM on my shoulder wince, but mostly
because it’s intrinsically more effective to let the players (by way of
their PCs) tell you where they want to go and what the important
routes in the campaign are.
This doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t draw roads or rivers on your
map! It just means that you shouldn’t feel compelled to flesh out
every road and river into a full-fledged route with detailed
landmarks, encounter tables, and the like (any more than you would
feel compelled to map out the floorplan of every single building in a
city).
In transportation planning there’s a concept called the desire
path: These are the paths created by the erosion of human travel
across grass or other ground covering. It’s the way that people want
to travel, even if the planned or intended paths are telling them to
take a different path.
It has become quite common for urban planners to open parks,
college campuses, and similar spaces without sidewalks, wait to see
where the desire paths naturally form, and only then install the
pavement.
You’re doing the same thing here: following the players’ paths of
desire and developing the campaign along the lines they have
chosen.

HEXCRAWLS
The prototypical hexcrawl is a small outpost on the borders of
civilization: It’s the lonely castle on the trackless heath; the small
town of the American Old West; the Roman fortress of
Camulodunum; the pirate’s cove clinging to the edge of an unknown
isle. When the PCs pass through the gates of that final refuge, they
journey into the unknown, uncertain of what they might find (or
what might find them).
The hexcrawl campaign structure is quite flexible and can be used
for other settings, but the key feature is that the PCs will be
explorers. If they have a map at all, they won’t be sticking to the
established roads and byways. (You’d use a pointcrawl, page 420,
for that.) Nor will they simply be passing through on their way to
somewhere else. (You’d want to use the route system for that.)
Instead, they’ll be repeatedly throwing themselves into the wild;
crisscrossing the land in an effort to tease out its deepest secrets and
most hidden treasures.
A hexcrawl is based around a hexmap, like the one on the next
page.
The numeric or alphanumeric references for each hex on the map
allows locations to be easily keyed to the map. During play, the GM
can determine which hex the PCs are starting in and then use travel
mechanics to determine how far they can move and where they
move. When they enter a new hex, the GM will tell them the terrain
type and determine whether or not they discover the keyed content
of the hex.
From the players’ perspective, the hexes themselves are usually a
player-unknown structure. In other words, the GM hides the hexes
from the players, instead describing the world to them as their
characters would perceive it and letting them declare their actions
accordingly. (This is because the abstraction of the hexmap is useful

and convenient for the GM as they track navigation, key encounters,
and so forth, but tends to have a negative impact for the players,
distancing them from their characters if they engage strictly with
the abstraction.)
The basic form of play in a hexcrawl is that the PCs are standing
in a hex and they choose a direction they want to travel. As they
travel, they’ll experience the encounters and locations keyed to the
hexcrawl.

Sometimes their navigation will be guided by their growing
knowledge of the area and the goals they’ve set for themselves, but
often (particularly early in a campaign where they’re still gaining
that knowledge) they may just choose a random direction into the
unknown to see what they can find.

RUNNING THE HEXCRAWL

Hexcrawls are run by the watch. Every character gets to perform
one watch action per watch, you resolve the actions while
introducing any events or landmarks encountered along the way,
and then you start a new watch and do it again.
During each watch:
1. Mark the watch and tick durations and daily resources (food,
water, etc.).
2. Make an encounter check.
3. Declare watch actions.
4. Resolve travel by:
Declaring pace.
Making a navigation check. On failure, determine veer.
Marking progress and tracking movement if entering a new hex.
5. Generate and resolve encounters, including Perception-type
checks (which may interrupt travel).
Exploration encounters are the keyed location of the current hex.
Wandering encounters are rolled on the random encounter table,
including a lair/tracks check.
6. Resolve other watch actions.

… wait a minute. Are you experiencing déjà vu?
That’s intentional. Exploration in a hexcrawl is run on the same
basic chassis as traveling via a route. This allows you to seamlessly
transition between them during play: The PCs can hack their way
through the trackless wastes of the Viridian Jungle, emerge onto the
Emeraude Highway, and gratefully follow that back to civilization.
WHEN ARE WATCH ACTIONS RESOLVED?
Forager: Other Watch Actions

Make Camp: Other Watch Actions
Navigator: Travel

Pack-Puller: Travel

Resting: Other Watch Actions
Scouting: Travel

Sentinel: Encounters (Perception-type checks)

Tracker: Finding Tracks (Other Watch Actions)
Tracker: Following Tracks (Travel)

Other: Usually under Other Watch Actions

HEXCRAWL RUNNING SHEET
On page 396 you’ll find the Hexcrawl Running Sheet. You can make
copies of this sheet and use it for your own hexcrawl adventures,
but it’s also easy to duplicate its functionality using a sheet of
scratch paper.

Party Name provides a convenient label for the sheet. This might
be the “T-Skulls” or “Unit 457.”
Duration Tracker provides a few slots for tracking effect
durations. To keep everything unified, these are measured in
watches, so an effect that lasts 24 hours, for example, would be
ticked six times before expiring.
Watch Tracker provides a space for marking off watches and
tracking days, including a space for listing the starting date of the
expedition.
Marching Order provides a template for tracking the current or
standard positioning of the PCs. It works just like the Marching
Order section of the dungeon running sheet, as described on page
69.
Standing Orders provides space for listing the PCs in your party
and their standard or current watch actions during travel watches,
while the Watch Tracker lets you list which PCs are keeping watch,
if any, during non-travel watches.
Hex Tracker lets you keep track of the expedition’s movement.
Write down the current day and watch in the left-hand column (for
example, 3-1 is the first watch of the third day), then mark the hex
the party is currently in and their intended direction of travel. Add
information on the veer if the party gets lost, and use the check
boxes to mark off progress.
Mark off progress in miles, and when you reach the end of one
row of check boxes (for near hex faces) or run out of check boxes
entirely (for far hex faces), the expedition has left the hex.
Reference their intended direction of travel and veer to determine
what hex they’ve entered and write that down in the next row.
Repeat.

HEXES

1 Hex = 12 miles (center to center/side to side) = 7-mile side =
124 square miles
The fundamental unit of the hexcrawl is, naturally, the hex. The
measurements above give the mathematical dimensions of a 12-mile
hex—in other words, a hex that is twelve miles across if measured
from one side to the opposite side. This measurement also,
conveniently, is the measurement from the center of one hex to the
center of a neighboring hex. So whether you imagine someone
standing in the center of a hex moving to the center of another hex
or someone starting on one side of the hex, traveling across it, and
then entering the hex on the far side, the distance traveled will be
12 miles. That’s a concrete measurement that we can perhaps rely
on as a foundation.
In most ways, however, a hex in a hexcrawl should be considered
an abstraction. If the PCs are “in” a hex, we don’t actually know
where, exactly, in the hex they are. The same thing is true for
locations keyed to the hex. In fact, we don’t want to know. By
embracing the abstraction, we make it easier to key content, to
manage movement, and to make meaningful navigational decisions
without the unmanageable complexity of detailed navigation across
specific topographical maps.
The one thing we need to know is whether or not we’ve left the
current hex and entered a new one. To do this, we keep track of an
expedition’s progress within the hex.

STARTING IN A HEX

If an expedition starts movement from a location within a hex,
assume that it requires 6 miles of progress to exit any face of the
hex. (We are effectively assuming, for the purposes of our
abstraction, that the location is in the exact center of the hex.)

CROSSING A HEX

It requires 12 miles of progress to exit a hex through one of the
three faces on the opposite side.

It requires 6 miles of progress to exit a hex through one of the two
nearest faces.
BACK THE WAY WE CAME
If an expedition doubles back along their own trail, simply reduce
their progress until they exit the hex.
CHANGING DIRECTION
Changing direction more than once within a hex will result in the
loss of 2 miles of progress each additional time the expedition
changes direction. (You can imagine them circling back and forth
through the hex.)

WHAT CAN YOU SEE IN A HEX?
A 12-mile hex is large enough that if you’re in it we can—
within our abstraction—broadly assume that you can’t see into
neighboring hexes. This means you don’t have to juggle a
gaggle of hexes: You only need to look at the key entry for the
hex the PCs are currently in.

If you want to get a little fancier, PCs with less than 6 miles of
progress can observe the terrain type of the hexes behind them.
PCs with more than 6 miles of progress can begin to discern the
terrain type of the hexes in front of them.
Mountains: Mountains can be seen from up to 6 hexes away
(72 miles).

HEXCRAWL NAVIGATION

In general, an expedition can navigate through the wilderness by
landmark or they can navigate by compass direction.
NAVIGATION BY LANDMARK
It is trivial to follow a road, river, or other natural feature of the
terrain. It’s similarly easy to head toward a visible landmark. The
landmark or terrain feature will determine the route of travel and
there’s no chance of becoming lost, so you can simply track the
number of miles traveled.
NAVIGATION BY COMPASS DIRECTION
Navigators trying to move in a specific direction through the
wilderness must make a navigation check using their Wisdom
(Survival) skill once per watch to avoid becoming lost. The DC of
the check is primarily determined by the terrain type of the current
hex (see here), though other factors may also apply.
Characters who fail the navigation check become lost.

LOST CHARACTERS

Characters who become lost may veer away from their intended
direction of travel. Roll 1d10 on the diagram below:

When lost characters exit a hex, they will exit through the face of
the hex indicated by the die roll.
FINDING LOCATIONS
The difficulty and complexity of finding a specific location
within the wilderness varies depending on the character’s
familiarity and approach.
Familiar Locations: If a navigator is in the same hex as a
location they’ve previously visited multiple times, they
automatically find the location. (Within the abstraction of
hexmapping, they’ve demonstrated sufficiently accurate
navigation.)
Unfamiliar Locations: Unfamiliar locations, even those a
navigator has been to once before, are found using encounter
checks. In other words, when a navigator has gotten the
expedition into the correct hex and an encounter for that
location is generated (see here), that indicates that the
navigator has found the location they were looking for.
Visible Locations: Locations designated as
automatically spotted by anyone in the same hex.

visible

are

Hidden Locations: Even when encountered, hidden locations
require a skill check or some special action to actually discover
them. This might be as simple as a Wisdom (Perception) check
or it might require the PCs to be carrying a specific magical
item that can reveal the location.

On Road: If a location is on a road, river, or trail, then a
character following the road, river, or trail will automatically
find the location. (Assuming it isn’t hidden.)
Characters who are lost remain lost. In the next hex neither their
intended direction of travel nor their veer will change. If characters
who are already lost fail another navigation check, their veer can
increase but not decrease. (If they have not yet begun to veer—i.e.,
they rolled a 5 or 6 on their initial veer check—then their veer can
increase in either direction.)
EXAMPLE
A lost party is already veering to the left when they fail another
navigation check. A roll of 1-4 on 1d10 would cause them to exit
the next hex two hex faces to the left of their intended direction, but
any other result would not change their veer at all.
RECOGNIZING YOU’RE LOST
Lost navigators continue making a navigation check once per watch.
If the check succeeds, they will recognize that they are no longer
certain of their direction of travel.
Navigators who encounter a clear landmark or unexpectedly enter
a distinctly new type of terrain can make an additional navigation
check to realize that they’ve become lost. (It’s also possible that
some situations will make it obvious to a character they’ve become
lost without requiring any check.)
REORIENTING
A navigator who realizes that they’ve become lost has several
options for reorienting themselves.
They can backtrack by following their own tracks using the
Finding Tracks action (see here). While tracking allows them to
retrace their steps, they must still recognize the point at which they

went off-track. If a character is successfully backtracking, they can
attempt a navigation check each watch, using the Navigation DC of
the terrain type, to correctly recognize whether they were on-track
or off-track. If the check is a failure, they reach the wrong
conclusion.
A character can determine a compass direction (“I want to go
east”) with a DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check. On a failure,
randomly determine the direction the navigator thinks is true north.
A navigator can attempt to precisely determine the direction they
should be traveling in order to reach a known objective by making a
navigation check at the Navigation DC of the terrain type + 10. If
the navigator fails this check, they immediately become lost again.
Determine the direction of travel like any other lost character.
USING A COMPASS
Compasses grant advantage to navigation checks. In addition, they
automatically eliminate veer at hex borders even if the user doesn’t
recognize that they were lost. (Even if you don’t recognize that you
ended up off course, the compass constantly reorients you toward
your intended direction of travel.)

HEXCRAWL ENCOUNTERS

Generating a random encounter in a hexcrawl is slightly more
complicated than it is for dungeon scenarios or route-based travel.
Make an encounter check by rolling 1d12. A roll of 1 indicates
that a wandering encounter should be generated. A roll of 12
indicates that the expedition has encountered a keyed location
within the hex as an exploration encounter.
When a keyed location is encountered, refer to the hex key and
describe the location to the players.
To generate a wandering encounter, follow this procedure:
1. Roll on the random encounter table.

2. Make a lair/tracks check by rolling 1d6. On a roll of 1 or 2, this
becomes an exploration encounter with the creature’s tracks. On
a roll of 6, it’s an exploration encounter and the creature(s) are
found in their lair. Otherwise, continue generating a wandering
encounter.
3. Determine the encounter distance (based on the terrain type of
the hex):
Open Vistas: 2d6 x 60 feet
Obstructed Visibility: 2d6 x 20 feet
Limited Visibility: 2d6 x 10 feet
4. Make a reaction check by rolling 2d6 and consulting the
reaction table below.
5. Determine surprise, if any. (In D&D, this will usually be done
with opposing NPC vs. PC Dexterity [Stealth] and Wisdom
[Perception] checks.)
REACTION TABLE

EXPLORATION ENCOUNTER
Exploration encounters only occur during watches in which the
characters are traveling or otherwise exploring an area. They do not

occur during watches in which the characters are resting or
otherwise stationary.
WANDERING ENCOUNTER
A wandering encounter can occur during any watch. They are
usually creatures, whose movement can bring them into contact
with the expedition regardless of whether the expedition is on the
move or not, but they could also be some similar phenomenon (e.g.,
meteors falling from the sky, a noxious vapor drifting through a
forest, etc.).
TRACKS
When a tracks encounter is indicated, the PCs discover (or have a
chance to discover) the creature’s tracks as an exploration
encounter. Such tracks can, of course, be followed, so you will need
to decide where they’re coming from and where they’re going to. An
easy answer to this question is whatever the keyed location in the
current hex is (and then you’ll just need to figure out why these
creatures were going to or from there).
I will also indicate on my random encounter table the hexes that
various random encounters might be based out of so that I don’t get
caught flat-footed—e.g., “1d4 + 4 goblins (Hex A4),” because Hex
A4 is a goblin village.
Note that tracks don’t necessarily mean foot- and/or paw prints. It
can also include stuff like sounds, smells, an abandoned campsite, or
a smoke trail rising into the sky to the west.
LAIR
This check functionally generates a new location in the current hex
—i.e., the lair of the creature type indicated by the random
encounter table. The more time the PCs spend in a particular area,
the more content will be added to that area.
This does, of course, leave you in the position of needing to
improvise a lair, most likely using some form of location-based
scenario structure (e.g., a dungeon). If that seems daunting, you’ve
got a couple of options:

1. Prep four or five small, unkeyed maps. Vary the types, including
perhaps a cave, a building, a small campsite, and so forth. When
a lair is indicated, simply grab one of these maps.
2. Simply ignore the lair result. You’ll end up with slightly more
wandering encounters with the PCs directly encountering
creatures, but that’ll be just fine. (And I promise not to tell
anybody.)
CHECK WITH ONE ROLL
Because the encounter check and the lair/tracks check use different
types of dice, you can roll both dice simultaneously to save time!

HOMEWORK
DESIGN A HEXCRAWL
Most of the homework you’ve done in this book has been some form
of, “Here’s how you can design a quick adventure! Take it for a spin
and see what it can do!” That’s not the case here. There’s no such
thing as a quick hexcrawl. It’s an inherently prep-heavy format: In
order for the hexmap to be large enough that the PCs don’t
immediately run off the edge of it in the first session, you’re going
to have a significant number of hexes, and you’re going to have to
fill those hexes with content.
This heavy prep load is a coin with two sides, though, because all
of that up-front prep means that you won’t need to do much prep
during the actual campaign. Instead of trying to find time every

week to prep a new scenario for your Friday night session, you can
get away with occasionally doing some light restocking but
otherwise just letting the PCs continue exploring what you’ve
already created.
This only works, though, if the campaign involves the PCs
repeatedly engaging the region around their home base, venturing
forth again and again to explore the area covered by your hexmap.
If that’s not the case—if, for example, the PCs are just passing
through the region—then you’ll end up prepping dozens and dozens
of hexes with stuff you’ll never use at the table. That’s a terrible and
frustrating use of your time, and you’ll almost certainly be better off
using a different structure.
So, long story short, this homework is very much a build-anentire-campaign assignment. It will be an immensely rewarding
experience, but not one to be undertaken lightly. When you’re ready
to take on this challenge, however, let us charge into the breach!
OPEN TABLE HEXCRAWLS
Hexcrawls are excellent for open tables specifically because they
require little per-session prep. And, vice versa, open tables are great
for hexcrawls because you’ll have multiple groups exploring the
region. Check out the The Open Table extra credit on page 463.

YOUR FIRST HEXMAP

Starting with a blank sheet of hex paper, you should design a 10 x
10 hexmap, meaning a map that is 10 hexes wide and 10 hexes tall,
for a total of 100 hexes. Alternatively, grab some hexmapping
software and do it all digitally.
In a hex at the center of the map, place the home base from
which the campaign will be based and the region will be explored.
(You won’t be able to precisely center this on a 10 x 10 hexmap, but
you’ll want to be as close as possible.) This home base could be any
of the following:

A small village
A large town

A border fort

A dwarven stronghold

The ancient nexus of portals through which the PCs arrive
A desert oasis

A floating island fortress chained to the ground
A crashed spaceship
An expedition’s base camp

In short, it can be almost anything you can imagine. The only
important feature is that it should probably provide the PCs with an
opportunity to rest and resupply. (Like larger dungeons, hexcrawls
are usually built around expedition-based play, as described on page
140.)
The size of this map is a good compromise between (a) making
the map large enough that the PCs can comfortably explore in any
direction while remaining on the map and (b) keeping your initial
number of hexes manageable so that you don’t end up getting
completely overwhelmed while filling them.

Fill in all the hexes on the blank map on the previous page with
terrain types, using the hexmap key symbols on the next two
pages. As you’re doing this, make a point of including at least three
or four different terrain types in the six hexes immediately
surrounding your home base. Even in the absence of all other
information, these different terrains will prompt the players to make
an initial navigation decision. (“Do you want to go into the forest,
the mountains, or the swamp?”)

As you’re placing terrain, think about the regions that you’re
creating: What’s the name of that forest? How large is that swamp?
Who or what do you imagine living in the Skullsplitter Hills? Jot
down some notes as these ideas occur to you.
You’ll want to place the major roads and rivers. In doing this,
you’ll also need to decide if there are any other settlements on the
map. As we’ve discussed, hexcrawls tend to work best where there’s
a lot of open, unexplored land for the PCs to roam through and …
well … explore. So, particularly for your first hexcrawl, I’d
recommend keeping settlements far apart (and, quite possibly, off
the edge of your initial map entirely).
With that being said, it can also be a good idea to include at least
a couple different routes leading away from your home base (e.g., a
couple of roads or a road and a river). Like the different terrain
types, these immediately present the players with easy, bare-bones
navigational choices.

KEYING A HEX

When you’re keying content to a hex, you’re keying a location. The
distinction between a “location” and an “encounter” can get a little
fuzzy if you stare at it for too long, but in practice it’s pretty
straightforward: If your key says there’s “an ogre walking down the
road,” then the next time the PCs come this way the ogre will
presumably be gone (particularly if they’ve killed it). If the key
instead reads “an ogre living in a shack,” then even if the PCs kill
the ogre, the shack will still be there.
Of course, one might argue that the PCs could do some quick
demolition work on the shack and make it disappear, too. (That
would be an excellent example of staring at the distinction too
long.) But the general point remains: You’re keying permanent
geography, not ephemeral events. (The latter are handled through
the encounter check.)

Each hex key will feature

the hex #, uniquely identifying the keyed hex,

the name of the hex, providing a summary and reminder of what
the hex contains at a glance, and
the keyed location’s discovery type (visible, hidden, or on
road/river/trail, see here), if any.

Then things get a little more complicated.
The hex might contain a small, specific site. These sites are
pretty similar to a dungeon room, and I’ll key them in a similar
manner, with boxed text, reactive skill checks, and site elements:

A3-ORLUK TOTEM

A giant statue, worn by weather and depicting an elephantine beast
of prey with black- and yellow-striped fur, holds a lonely vigil in the
center of the grassy plains.
INTELLIGENCE (NATURE)-DC 16
The statue depicts a creature known as an orluk.
STATUE
The yellow-and-black stone is not painted, but rather two different
types of colored granite have been quarried and then shaped to take
advantage of the natural strata.
Some sites might be quite large, but with a uniform experience
that supports a similar approach:

N15-RECENT FOREST FIRE

Several acres of this hex have been scorched by a wildfire. Foraging
checks are made at disadvantage in this hex, but if the check fails
due to disadvantage, the forager discovers the burn site.
Larger sites, however, will more commonly be prepped as a
location-based adventure. This will usually be a dungeon—
anything from a micro-dungeon to a megadungeon—but it could
also be designed with an alternative structure, like a raid (see here)
or caravanserai. In my hex key I’ll often just include a reminder to
check the separate adventure notes, sometimes accompanied by a
minimal description of the location:

F15-SKULL ROCK (ON RIVER)

A rock shaped like a skull thrusts out of the center of the river.
SKULL’S MOUTH
Crawling through the mouth leads to a crypt. See adventure notes.
A hex could also be keyed with a community, like a city, kasbah,
shantytown, or dwarven citadel. These are, of course, urban
adventures (see here), but my tip is that, unless it’s a community
you’re really interested in diving into, you can usually get away
with keying the results of a single urban investigation action (see
here) rather than developing a full-fledged city. However the PCs
choose to interact with a particular community, you can usually
respond by treating it as an investigation action and serving up the
prepared response.

STOCKING YOUR HEXES

Ideally, you want to key every hex. For a 10 x 10 hexmap, as we’ve
noted, that’s 100 hexes. If you’re thinking that sounds like a lot of
work, you’re not wrong. Even with a majority of your hexes being

small sites (and, therefore, roughly equivalent to a dungeon room in
terms of prep), it can still be a staggering task.
But it needs to be done. If you have a hexcrawl with a bunch of
empty hexes, it creates pacing problems. Even more importantly, it
results in the PCs being unable to reliably find landmarks, which
makes it impossible for them to navigate through the wilderness.
The whole structure of the hexcrawl breaks down.
You can also end up with the same problem in the opposite
direction: If you get a lot of hexes keyed with multiple locations, the
abstraction of the hexcrawl collapses as the PCs engage in lots of
navigation inside the hex. This is also referred to as sub-hex
navigation, and it can create problems because, by design, when
you’re running a hexcrawl, you’re not worried about where exactly
something is located “inside” the hex—you just know that the PCs
are in the hex and the location is in the same hex. But if there are
multiple locations in the hex, the players are going to expect the
geographic relationships between those locations to remain
consistent, despite the fact that there’s no mechanism in the
hexcrawl structure for keeping track of that.
It’s best to just avoid this problem by only keying one location per
hex, but sometimes multiple locations in a single hex can’t be
avoided. That’s okay, you’ll just need a different mechanism for
handling the sub-hex navigation. A pointcrawl can be used for this,
as discussed on page 420.
But I digress: You have 100 hexes. How are you going to fill them
all?
TECHNIQUE #0: KEEP IT SIMPLE
Before we get started, it’s important to know that this may not be as
much work as you might think. There are a couple of secrets to that.
The first secret, as I’ve mentioned before, is that when you’re
prepping material for yourself, polish is overrated. (Details are
also overrated, with the proviso that essential details and awesome
details should always be jotted down.) If I were writing up a
dungeon behind a waterfall for someone else to use, I’d probably

take the time to mention how wet and slick the stairs leading down
into the dungeon are; the damp moistness in the air of the first
chamber (providing a slight haze that can be burned away
dramatically by a fireball trap); and the way the dampness gives way
to a chilled condensation that hangs in glistening drops from the
rough-hewn walls as you descend into the dungeon. But if you’re
prepping for yourself, you don’t need to write that down.
Trust your voice as a GM. During play, based on your intrinsic
understanding of the scenario and the environment, the
circumstances will provide the logical and evocative details you
need to flesh things out. And by placing trust in yourself, you can
save yourself a ton of prep time.
The second secret is that the amount of detail required by a hex
key can vary quite a bit. You can use minimal keys. Just because
something is geography, it doesn’t mean that it has to be elaborate.
Don’t fall into the trap of thinking that every hex “needs” to have a
20-room dungeon in it. It definitely doesn’t. It almost certainly
shouldn’t! Remember the ogre’s shack and the orluk totem? A hex
key doesn’t have to be any more complicated than that.
TECHNIQUE #1: BE CREATIVE, BE AWESOME, BE SINCERE
We’ll get to the tips, tricks, shortcuts, and/or cheats in a moment,
but first things first: Do some honest brainstorming and pour some
raw creativity onto the page.
The neat ideas you’ve been tossing around inside your head for
the past few days? Everything your players think would be cool?
Everything you think would be cool? Everything you wish the last
GM you played with had included in the game?
Put ’em in hexes.
Then think about the setting logically: What needs to be there in
order for the setting to work? For the stuff you’ve already keyed to
work?
Get ’em in hexes.
Bring your creativity to the table. And make sure everything you
include is awesome, because life is too short to waste time on the

mediocre or “good enough” or the “I guess I need to do that.” If
there’s something mundane or generic, give it a twist or add
something extra.
Finally, throughout this entire process, be sincere. I think it’s
really important to stay true to yourself when you’re doing design
work: You have a unique point of view and a unique aesthetic. Even
when you’re bringing in material or inspiration from other sources,
apply it through your own perspectives and values.
TECHNIQUE #2: JUMP AROUND
It can be useful to start at Hex A1, go to Hex A2, and then
systematically proceed on through the As before getting to the Bs.
But if you’re working on A3 and you get a cool idea that belongs
on the other side of the map, don’t hesitate: Jump over there and
key up Hex F7.
This is not only useful from a practical standpoint: It also feels
great when you get to Column F and discover three-quarters of the
hexes have already been filled in.
TECHNIQUE #3: STEAL
Okay, you’ve filled a couple dozen hexes, but now you’re starting to
run out of ideas. What next?
Steal.
If your RPG of choice has published adventures, grab the best of
them and start dropping them into hexes. If you don’t already own
adventures and can’t afford to buy them, do a search online for fancreated scenarios. The One Page Dungeon Contest, for example, is
an all-you-can-eat smorgasbord for this sort of thing.
Not every adventure can be dropped straight into a hex, of course,
but even adventures that aren’t explicitly location-based will often
feature cool locations that can be ripped out and easily adapted. If
the adventure has multiple locations, rip them apart and drop each
location into a separate hex.
The stuff you steal doesn’t have to be fully developed, either. You
can find countless free adventure maps online, just waiting to be

filled with cool encounters.
As you’re harvesting material like this, you may start to notice
patterns: Maybe you’ve grabbed three different adventures featuring
fairies. How could they be connected? What other creatures from
the Feywild might be found in the region?
TECHNIQUE #4: RANDOM GENERATORS
We started by filling the map with every ounce of creative thought
we had. Then we started recklessly stealing everything we could lay
our hands on. But we’re still staring at empty hexes. Now what?
Now we need to get our creative juices flowing again by rapidly
injecting fresh ideas that will break us out of the dried-out box our
thinking is currently trapped in. There are a lot of ways to provide
this stimuli:
Roll a random page number in the Monster Manual. Do it again.
What are these two monsters doing together in this hex?

Draw four random Magic the Gathering cards and use their names
and graphics for inspiration.
Ask an AI text generator to provide a list of 20 fantasy locations
and grab the best ones.

Go over to your collection of fantasy novels and pluck one off the
shelf. Flip to a random page: Where are the characters? Can you
use that location, or one like it, in your hexcrawl?
There are also a large number of RPGs that actually include
random generators designed for exactly this purpose. (Or generators
that can be repurposed or used for inspiration.) Sadly, this doesn’t
include the current edition of D&D, although previous editions did
include them (and there are a number of games similar to D&D you
could use to generate similar locations if D&D is your game of
choice).
TECHNIQUE #5: SPIN-OFFS

Regardless of how you’re stocking a hex, you should keep your mind
open to other locations that the current hex suggests.
For example, you’ve got a necromancer in a crystalline spire
who’s served by a bunch of goblins he’s charmed by writing arcane
runes on the inside of their eyelids and then sewing their eyes shut.
Where’d he get the goblins from? Maybe’s there a village of them
living nearby. They protect a tree that bears a single bright red fruit
each year. The fruit has magical properties and each year the
necromancer comes to claim the fruit and take away goblin slaves.
Or you’re keying a grotto that a bunch of bandits are using as a
hideout. Turns out these bandits have longbows of remarkably high
quality. This is because they’re trading with a one-eyed troll who
lives in a cave that can only be accessed through a green crystal that
thrusts up through the forest floor: Lay your hand upon the crystal,
say the magic password, and the crystal becomes intangible. The
troll is a master bowyer.
TECHNIQUE #6: WALK AWAY
Finally, be willing to walk away from the project and take a break:
Watch a TV show. Read a book. Flip through some unrelated game
manuals. Power up the PlayStation®.
Give your brain a chance to breathe and your creative batteries a
chance to recharge.
This is not, by any stretch of the imagination, a comprehensive
catalog or definitive list of techniques for stocking a hexcrawl. But
it’s stuff that’s worked for me while stocking hexcrawls. Maybe it’ll
work for you, too. Experiment and play around until you find what
works best for you.

STATUS QUO DESIGN

Hexcrawls benefit from status quo design, which is basically a
fancy way of saying that you prep chunks of the game world in a
particular situation, but then you hit the pause button and don’t
touch it again until the players’ actions interact with the situation. As

soon as the players do agitate or change that status quo, though,
that chunk of the game world becomes active.
It’s kind of an inverted quantum state: Until you observe a
subatomic particle, it’s impossible to know its current state. With
status quo prep, on the other hand, you know exactly what the state
is until you look at it.
Status quo design can be useful in a lot of ways when you’re
running a roleplaying game, but its utility is starkly obvious when it
comes to a hexcrawl. When you’re done stocking your hexcrawl,
you’ll have 100 hexes of keyed content. If you tried to reach in after
every session and update every single one of those hexes with a
running narrative of events, it would be a daunting task. It would
also be a pointless one: Your players won’t have seen the previous
situation in the vast majority of those hexes, and they likely won’t
see the new situation you’re creating, either. In other words, the PCs
aren’t actually observing or being affected by any of this activity
that you’re generating. You’re doing a bunch of stuff, but it’s not
producing any value at the actual game table.
Leaving these various locations in a “frozen” state may seem
artificial, but it’s really just the way that the world works most of
the time: Imagine that you go to a diner for lunch today. You see
some waitresses and one of them takes your order. They deliver the
food.
If you had gone to the diner for lunch tomorrow instead of today,
what would’ve happened? You’d see some waitresses, one of them
would take your order, and they’d deliver the food. If you go next
month, will it be different? Probably not. Maybe the waitresses will
be different or the owner may tweak the menu a bit, but if you’d
never been to the diner before, these changes would not
meaningfully alter your experience.
Now, let’s say that you went to the diner today and fired a rocket
launcher through the window. Then you go back tomorrow. Is the
diner different now?
Of course it is.

When you’re prepping a hex, you’re generally prepping the diner.
If the PCs go to the diner and do some minor interactions (e.g., they
meet a waitress and learn her name is Nancy), then the diner is put
into motion and the next time they come back there may be some
minor differences (Nancy recognizes them, Nancy has been fired,
there’s a new menu special, etc.). If the PCs go to the diner and
blow it up with a rocket launcher, then there’ll be big changes and
A LOT of motion (as the diner is rebuilt, Nancy goes looking for a
new job, etc.).
This same principle can be extended to more dramatic and/or
precarious status quos, too.
For example, you might prep the logging village of Caerdheim for
a hexcrawl and know that a murder is about to happen there! But
that murder doesn’t happen immediately as the campaign begins.
The village is in status quo. It’s only when the PCs show up that you
hit the play button and the murder takes place. (Or Nancy gets into
a fight with her boss. Or a logging triceratops breaks loose and
rampages through town.)
THE ACTIVE QUO
The status quo also doesn’t mean “boring.” The status quo of a
pirate cove, for example, isn’t “The pirates are all sitting around
doing nothing.” The status quo of a pirate cove is a bunch of pirate
ships sailing out to pillage the high seas. The best status quo design
is usually more like a coiled spring: The lightest interaction from the
PCs will cause an explosion of activity.
NON-LOCAL EFFECTS
The action that forces a location (or organization or NPC) into
“motion” doesn’t have to be direct. For example, when the PCs
unleash a horrible plague that kills goblins? They don’t actually
need to visit the dungeon full of goblins on the other side of the
map in order for those goblins to be affected by the plague and the
status quo of that dungeon to be changed.
These non-local effects don’t require cataclysmic scenarios, either.
A single NPC being knocked loose from a location can act as a free

radical, putting any number of other elements into motion. For
example, when the necromancer escapes from the PCs’ raid of
Bleached Bone Gulley, maybe they end up slaying the goblin chief
and enslaving the tribe.
RETURN TO THE STATUS QUO
With that being said, in the absence of continued PC interaction,
elements of the campaign world will generally trend back toward a
status quo again. (Note that I said a status quo; it’s usually not likely
that things will go back to the same status quo. PCs tend to be more
disruptive than that.)
For example, the PCs raid a cult compound, wreak a lot of havoc,
and kill a couple of the cult’s leaders before being forced to retreat.
Over the next week the cult calls in reinforcements from some of
their other cells to guard against further incursions until they can
finish packing up and moving their operations to a new location.
If the PCs don’t reengage with the cult within a couple weeks of
the original raid, then the new status quo features steampunk
cyborg guards (the other cells were up to some wacky stuff), an
abandoned cultist compound, and a new operational center set up in
the sub-basement of an emir’s palace.

WILDERNESS
POINTCRAWLS
Now we come to the last of our structures for wilderness play.
Where the hexcrawl abstracts a wilderness into small, explorable
areas, the pointcrawl can abstract the same region conceptually by
focusing on how characters navigate and move through the space.

In other words, you create a map of locations and you connect
them with paths, forming a node map. We refer to the locations as
points (thus the first half of the name) and the paths as connectors.
During play, PCs in a location can choose one of the paths
connected to that location and travel along it to another location.
They can thus crawl (there’s the other half of the name) through a
pointmap.
The pointmap on the facing page depicts part of the same region
shown on the sample hexcrawl map on page 392. You can see,
therefore, how you can use both the pointcrawl and hexcrawl
structures in the same campaign, swapping which structure you’re
using based on how the players are choosing to interact with the
world.
As we look at the connections that make up the structure of the
pointcrawl, we can start with the literal paths: These are trails,
roads, rivers, and the like that are literal paths in the game world.
(Thus the name.) These are almost always a player-known structure,
and they have a one-to-one correspondence with the game world:
The line on the pointmap is directly representing a specific highway
or the like.
But pointcrawls will usually also feature abstract paths, which
represent the natural flow of travelers through the world without
being one specific route that you could point to in the game world.
That might be because there is no path (the PCs are trying to cross
the trackless wastes of the Eldlands), but it can also be because
there’s a multitude of paths and it doesn’t matter which one they
take. (Are they taking an old deer trail? Following the river? Just
trying to cut through the forest as best they can? Small differences
in the travelogue aside, they’ll all cross the same region, use the
same encounter table, and take them to the same place.)
You can see the difference between literal and abstract paths by
looking at the Maernath pointmap: If the PCs leave Maernath by the

King’s Road, they’re following a literal path (the actual road) and if
they go that way again, they’ll be taking the same road. If they
instead head southwest into the Gloomboughs forest, that’s an
abstract path. The next time they go that way they might take the
same path, or they might take another.
You can show the players the pointmap of a region if you want,
but this isn’t necessary. Assuming the pointmap remains a GM-only
tool and a player-unknown structure, the GM will become an
“interpreter” where abstract paths are concerned, translating the

players’ intentions into the pointcrawl system, using the pointcrawl
system to resolve it, and then describing the outcome to the players
in terms of the fiction.
The players may announce specific intentions. This can be a
literal path (“let’s take the King’s Road”) or it might be based on a
known landmark (“let’s head toward Mt. Dramadand!”). Either way,
you can simply look at the pointmap, see their destination, and
move them along the appropriate path.
Alternatively they might announce a nonspecific intention. This
will often be a compass direction, such as, “Let’s head east from
Maernath.” Looking at the pointmap you know that east will take
them in the direction of Mt. Dramadand, so you select that path.
Finally, they may announce an indirect destination. In other
words, a destination that is not directly linked to their current
location by a path. For example, from Maernath they might say,
“Let’s go to the Graymires.” Once again looking at the pointmap,
you can see that the most direct route involves following the path to
Mt. Dramadand and then following the path from there to the
Graymires. (Alternatively, seeing the other route via the Old Keep,
you might ask them if they want to go northwest across the plains
or stay closer to the mountains. Or, if they’re already familiar with
both routes, you might just ask them which route they want to
take.)
What you wouldn’t do is have them go straight from Maernath to
the Graymires while skipping the points in between. In the absence
of intentionality (e.g., the players saying that they’re going to head
northwest, but are going to specifically steer clear of the Old Keep),
the pointmap represents the normal “flow” of travel: If you head
from Maernath to the Graymires, you will either visit (or at least
pass by) Mt. Dramadand or the Old Keep.

MAKING THE POINTMAP

You could hypothetically make a pointmap with no other reference
for the game world and run a campaign from just that and nothing

else, but it would likely be a struggle at best. There’s a lot of
information about the world that feels fairly essential (e.g., what’s
the terrain like between Maernath and the Fungal Forest?) that
would require extra effort to key onto the pointmap. I, personally,
would find it difficult to even create a pointmap in such a vacuum.
(Your mileage may vary.)
I find it useful to think of a game world as being layered. A
traditional map, a geopolitical map, an airship route map, a
hexmap, a pointmap—these are all different ways of creating,
presenting, and accessing information about the world; they’re
separate “layers” that all coexist with each other (or, at least, can
coexist with each other). The pointmap, therefore, is one stratum,
but it’s embedded within the larger strata of the game world.
Therefore, when I’m designing a pointmap, I will start with an
existing map of the campaign world and use it to figure out the
pathing, like the example on the next page.
The source map doesn’t have to be a hexmap; it’s just convenient
in this case since we already have a hexmap of this region. You
might instead use geographical, topographical, geopolitical, or
cadastral maps. The key info you need is as follows:
Where are the points of interest?

What are the diegetic routes (roads, rivers, etc.)?

What is the travel time between points (generally calculated from
terrain/route type and distance)?
As you’re sketching out your pointmap, start with the literal
paths: Look at the major roads, for example. What locations do they
connect? Draw those connections. Is river travel significant? Add
those connections, too. In an “edge of civilization” setting like
Maernath, this may not give you very much. In other regions,
though, it may give you a lot more structure.

Either way, your next step is, unsurprisingly, the abstract paths.
These are trickier, but what I find useful is to just kind of imagine
myself traveling the world. Easy pickings at this stage are any points
of interest that aren’t yet connected to the pointmap: If you wanted
to get there, how would you do it? But even points that are located
on literal paths may still have abstract links.
You’ll also likely be adding additional points that don’t appear on
your source map—adventure sites, minor landmarks, and the like.

Once you’ve got all the connections in place, go through and
determine the terrain type and distance for each path. These can
be listed directly on the map for easy reference during play.
HIDDEN ROUTES
A hidden route in a pointcrawl is a connection between two
points that isn’t immediately obvious; i.e., the PCs have to find
the route before they can use it. This might be an illusory druid
path, a teleportation circle, or perhaps an underground tunnel.
Hidden routes are often discovered as part of a scenario or
while exploring a particular location. In other cases,
discovering the hidden route might be as simple as making an
Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Survival) check in the
right place.
Hidden routes can be indicated on your map using a dotted
line. For example, there’s a connection within the Violet Halls
dungeon to the Doomcaves on the far side of the mountains
that’s indicated as a hidden route on the Maernath map.

RUNNING A POINTCRAWL

When the expedition leaves their current point, they choose one of
the paths connected to their current point and follow it.
Then, during each watch:
1. Mark the watch and tick durations and daily resources (food,
water, etc.).
2. Make an encounter check.
3. Declare watch actions.
4. Resolve travel by:
Declaring pace.

Making a navigation check.
Tracking movement on the pointmap.
5. Resolve encounters, including Perception-type checks (which
may interrupt travel).
6. Resolve other watch actions.
When the expedition reaches a new point, describe it to them and
let them interact with it. At some point they will choose a path
connected to the new point, and the process repeats.
This procedure is essentially identical to running a route, except
that the expedition has a choice of paths at each point. This is
probably unsurprising, because a pointmap can also be thought of as
a map of many individual routes that the PCs can swap between.
OFF POINT
If the PCs are in a point on the pointmap, you can just follow this
procedure. If for some reason they’ve slipped “off” the pointmap,
simply funnel them logically into the pointmap and continue from
there.
You might be able to assume that they’re “at” the nearest point
(e.g., they’re close enough to Mt. Dramadand that they’re basically
“coming from the volcano” as far as other points are concerned).
Alternatively, if you want to get all formal about it, you could think
of their current location as a “temporary point” and think about
how it would attach to the pointmap as they begin traveling.

HOMEWORK
THE MANY-HEADED POINT

A wilderness pointcrawl is a great tool, but it really only scratches
the potential of the pointcrawl structure, which is incredibly
versatile because each “point” can be literally any point of interest.
Those points may be extremely specific, like “the orluk totem
outside of town,” but they can also be quite vast, like “the city of
Kingsdeep” or “the Empire of Catalac.” Even better, the structure is
very flexible, with points of different “scale” easily coexisting. (For
example, the orluk totem and the city of Kingsdeep can both appear
on the same pointmap.) It can even be trivially fractal, with the
point on one pointmap being an entirely self-contained pointcrawl
in its own right. (This also means that a pointcrawl can be used as
either a scenario structure or a campaign structure.)
Pointcrawls can also be adapted to completely different milieus:
You can use pointcrawls for a ruined city, a cyberspace network, a
galactic star map, or the vast caverns of the Shadow Deep.
And this is, in fact, your homework assignment.
It’s actually the last homework assignment you’ll find in this
book. If you’ve plowed through the entire volume from the front
cover up to this point, then you’ve already learned (and used!) a
bunch of different scenario structures: mysteries and heists and
dungeons and social events and more!
(If you haven’t done that yet, you may want to hit the pause
button here and come back later.)
As you’ve discovered, every one of those scenario structures can
be used to create an almost limitless number of different scenarios.
At some point, though, you’re going to want to create a scenario and
you’ll discover that these scenarios structures—even in combination
—won’t get the job done. When that happens, you’ll have to figure
out how to create a new scenario structure for yourself, something
that will guide both what you prep for the scenario and how you
run it.
This homework is about dipping your toes into that pool by taking
the pointcrawl structure and adapting it into a non-wilderness
adventure or campaign. We’ll start by taking the wilderness
pointcrawl structure we’re already familiar with and boiling it down

to the most essential procedure. In doing so, we’ll reduce it to its
most basic structure, which we can then expand and build upon for
our variant structure.

BASIC POINTCRAWL PROCEDURE

Running a basic pointcrawl boils down to a three-step procedure.
STEP 1: FOLLOW A PATH
The PCs choose one of the paths connected to their current point.
TIME
The length of time it takes to follow a path may be
standardized for an entire pointcrawl. (For example, you may
assume it always takes 10 to 15 minutes to move from one
point to another in an urban setting.) Alternatively, different
connections may take different amounts of time. If so, this can
be indicated directly on the map using either small numbers or
dots (with each dot representing one standard interval of time).
In setting these times, you’ll most likely be taking the strata of
the pointcrawl into account (e.g., traveling 1 mile down an
open road will take less time than traveling 10 miles through
the tangled bracken of a wild forest).
STEP 2: RANDOM ENCOUNTER
Check for a random encounter.
PROCEDURE
Any number of random encounter procedures could be
employed here. You might check once per path, once per
interval, once per watch, or at any other rate that makes sense
for the current ’crawl.

STEP 3: ARRIVAL
The PCs arrive at the next point.

ADAPTATION

What’s the non-wilderness milieu of your new pointcrawl? There
were a few options listed previously, but you can really go with
anything where there are points of interest connected to each other
(and a reason for the PCs to explore or travel through them).
At this point, you’ve got a couple options.
First, you can develop your pointcrawl through play: Create a
pointmap, key the points, and set up a random encounter table.
Then just start playing. The basic procedure above is fully
functional.
As you’re running this pointcrawl, you’ll start finding the places
where you need more support. When problems come up at the table,
you’ll obviously need to find ways to deal with them and play
through them. This often works just fine, but you’ll also want to
keep notes and maybe even do some postmortems with your players
so that they can provide their own feedback on what’s working and
what’s not. For problems or rough spots or questions that you’re
running into again and again, you’ll likely want to develop a formal
solution that can be applied again and again.
You can avoid some of these rough spots, of course, by trying to
anticipate them before play begins: What types of actions are the
players likely to take? Where will they want to go? How will they
want to get there? What does the pointmap look like? What do the
paths represent?
Imagine running a scenario. What are the things you’re likely to
say? Here are some examples:

“Crossing Waterloo Bridge, you head south past the London Eye
to Lambeth Palace.” (The PCs are leaving a vampire den near
Covent Garden. Waterloo Bridge, the London Eye, and Lambeth
Palace are all locations on the pointmap. In this case, the players
already have some familiarity—or perhaps a great deal of
familiarity—with the city, recognizing these locations without the
GM needing to describe them.)

“Following the bonsai turtles, you pass through an arch in the
hedgerow and find yourselves standing at the top of an ancient
amphitheater. Benches of worn stone descend to a circular area
where three of the bonsai turtles have already gathered. On the
far side of the amphitheater you can see two other arches like the
one you’ve just come through, leading to other paths in the
Maze.” (The amphitheater is a location the PCs have just
discovered. The GM is indicating the existence of two other paths,
leading to other locations, that the PCs could follow.)

“You’re following the gateway IP to the subnet when you see
Black-IC approaching.” (The PCs are traveling along a connection
and a random encounter has been triggered.)

“You exit the gnarl in the Ceti Alpha system. Do you want to dock
here, continue hubward to Ceti Beta, or detour spinward via
Canopus?” (These are all stellar systems and gnarl-ways the PCs
are familiar with.)
Really thinking about how you’ll describe the world through the
lens of the pointcrawl and how the players will take action within
the context of the pointcrawl will tell you a lot about how the
adventure is supposed to flow at the table, the types of actions you’ll
need to be able to resolve, and the like.
As you’re putting these pieces together, testing them during play,
and revising them, you’ll want to make a point of arranging all of
your material into a specific running procedure. Literally “do this,
then this, then this.” (You’ve seen and used these for almost every
scenario structure and campaign structure in this book.)

Once you’ve got your procedure written down, do a couple
imaginary test runs to spot any obvious problems. (You’ll almost
certainly discover more once you’re actually interacting with the
players and juggling their actions and responses.) One thing you
want to watch out for in particular is mis-sequencing: Any point
where a step in your procedure requires information you don’t have
yet.
For example, when I ran my first hexcrawl campaign, I had put
together most of the tools described in the Hexcrawls chapter (see
here), but I’d mis-sequenced the random encounters:
Okay, check for an encounter. (roll dice)

There is an encounter, so let’s determine what the encounter is.
(roll dice) A group of 1d12 goblins, so roll the number of goblins.
(roll dice) 8 goblins, write that down.
Now, where does the encounter take place? First, determine time
of day. (roll dice) Where would they be at that time of day?

Ask them what direction they’re going, then calculate their speed,
figure out where they’ll be.

Now check to see if they got lost. They did, so go back—this is the
first mis-sequencing!—and determine where they actually ended
up … (roll dice)
Hmm. So that means they’re in this hex over here. But that means
the terrain type has shifted, so I need to go back and recalculate
the distance they actually traveled. (Another mis-sequencing!)
Oh! And the encounter table changed. So that means they didn’t
encounter goblins, they would have encountered … Wait, what
did I roll?

It was a train wreck. There were lots of painfully long pauses
while I fidgeted with my notes.
And that’s okay! That’s why we playtest and revise and refine.
The other thing I like to keep an eye out for is busywork: Where
are you expending a lot of effort to generate a result or manage

information, but it’s not creating value by improving the experience
at the table? Pay particular attention to any place where you’re
doing a bunch of stuff behind your screen that’s never perceived by
the players.
One way to solve busywork is to simply eliminate it, but the other
option is to ask yourself how you can make that material, whatever
it is, visible to the players (and therefore relevant).
For example, if you go through all the work of advancing a
faction clock (see here), but then never complete the process by
figuring out how the progress clock intersects the PCs, that would
just be busywork: rolling dice and filling in ticks, but never to any
real effect as far as the players are concerned. It’s when the progress
clock impacts the PCs—as a rumor, a strike team, a job offer, a
newspaper headline, etc.—that the faction clock becomes
meaningful.
Finally, consider recordkeeping. The Dungeon Running Sheet
(see here) and Hexcrawl Running Sheet (see here) are both powerful
tools that help you keep track of vital information that you’ll need
to reference repeatedly and/or significantly later. Are you losing
track of stuff? Make a point of writing that down. And once you’re
writing stuff down, is there a way you can systematize that to make
it easier or even more useful?
ANNOUNCE THE PLAYTEST
If you’re trying out something new, it doesn’t hurt to tell the players:
“Hey! We’re going to be play testing something new tonight. There’ll
probably be some rough edges while I figure things out, and I’d
really appreciate your feedback after the session.”
We’re all in this together, right? And if the players know what’s
going on, they’ll help you out.

CREATING YOUR
CAMPAIGN
How do you go from saying, “I want to run an RPG campaign” to
actually running your first session?
The core skills of designing and running adventures are a large
part of that, but in actual practice there are a bunch of really
practical tasks that need to be accomplished, starting with the most
basic: Who’s actually sitting at the table and playing the game with
you?

FINDING PLAYERS

In order to play any multiplayer game, you have to start by inviting
people to play with you. When it comes to roleplaying games, you
can either
A. invite friends, i.e., the people you already know, or
B. find gamers, i.e., people you don’t know who share the mutual
interest of playing a roleplaying game.
Maybe you have friends who are gamers. That’s fantastic! Those
would certainly be the first people I would talk to. They might even
be people who you’ve played with before in another GM’s game or,

if this isn’t your first rodeo, people who have played in your
previous campaigns.
That’s recruiting on easy mode! (You lucky bastard.)
Those interested in playing RPGs often seek out fellow hobbyists,
so let’s start there. In your hometown, you can check out your local
game store. Some will have bulletin boards where you can
advertise your game or find players looking to find a game. Game
stores will also host organized play events, like the Adventurers
League for D&D or the Society for Pathfinder, where you can meet
other players.
You can also do some googling for local game clubs, which can
offer similar LFG (looking for group) services and opportunities to
socialize with other gamers. Online meetup groups on Facebook,
Reddit, and similar sites can also be good places to reach out, as can
schools, libraries, and community centers (some of which may
already have game clubs). You may also have luck finding kindred
spirits at board game nights.
It can be easier to catch something if you throw your net on a
national or even global scale, which is something that virtual
tabletops, video calls, and similar tools make possible. Check out
forums, subreddits, Discord servers, and similar online RPG
communities. Many virtual tabletop programs will also offer LFG
services and/or online communities through their sites.
Last, but certainly not least, what about your non-gamer
friends?
In many ways, this should be easy: Just ask them. The same way
you’d ask them to watch a movie or play a board game.
But one of the reasons that many would-be GMs try to seek out
existing gamers, instead of just asking their friends to play a game
with them, is that it’s often seen as difficult to get new players to try
an RPG for the first time. For a long time, this was largely because
of the “geek stigma” around roleplaying games, but the geeks have
long since inherited the earth, so what’s going on here?
A lot of it has to do with the commitment you’re asking these new
players to make. As you think about running an RPG, you’re likely

imagining a grand campaign—perhaps a D&D epic from 1st to 20th
level!—but that’s a really big commitment for someone who’s never
played before! It’s not really comparable to a movie night or playing
a board game at all! “Hey, would you like to spend every Saturday
afternoon for the next year doing this thing you’ve never done
before?”
What I recommend, therefore, is recruiting through one-shots.
(The Mephits & Magmin adventure on page 46 is a great example of
the type of one-shot scenario you can run for new players.) Don’t
pitch a long-term commitment. Just ask people to hang out for one
afternoon. That’s a lot more like hanging out at the bar or playing
Ultimate Frisbee in the park.
Not everyone who plays an RPG with you for the first time will
decide that it’s something they want to do long-term. But some of
them will! The friends who do? Now they’re gamer friends!
And that’s recruiting on easy mode.
We make our own luck here.

THE CAMPAIGN CONCEPT

With players in hand (or possibly a little before that), you’ll want to
figure out your campaign concept. This can be roughly broken
down into the answers to three questions:
Who are the characters?
What do they do?
Where do they do it?

Some roleplaying games are designed to give you answers to some
or all of these questions, although the answers can range from the

very specific to the vaguely generic.
D&D, for example, provides fairly generic answers:
You’re fantasy heroes.

Who go on adventures.
In a Tolkienesque fantasy world.
Despite being fairly vague, these answers are good enough that
you can usually just tell people, “We’re playing D&D,” and they’ll be
able to create characters that will probably work for whatever
campaign you’re planning.
Ars Magica, on the other hand, defaults to the following:
You’re powerful magi.
Who have banded together to found a covenant.

Somewhere in a fantasy version of medieval Europe.
This example may make it a little clearer that, if you’re running
an Ars Magica campaign, you’ll need to nail down exactly where in
medieval Europe this particular covenant is being founded. By
extension, the same thing is true for D&D across all three questions:
You want to take all those vague answers and start fleshing them
out and nailing them down with specifics.
The creation of a campaign concept—i.e., providing concrete
answers to these questions—can be a collaborative process. The
question, “What game do y’all want to play next?” is basically the
most simplistic form of this, but you can also work with your
players to answer the key questions of the campaign concept.
Having vague answers (like the ones D&D provides) can actually be
quite useful here, since it can help guide the group more effectively
than a completely blank slate would.
Some RPGs are more explicitly designed to do this. For example,
John Harper’s Blades in the Dark gives very specific answers to most
of the campaign concept questions:

You’re playing members of a small criminal organization.
Who do scores in order to build their organization into a large
and powerful faction.

In the postapocalyptic fantasy city of Doskvol, cloaked in eternal
night.
And then the character creation mechanics prompt the players to
choose what type of criminal organization they’re running
(assassins, cultists, smugglers, etc.) and, therefore, the types of
scores they’ll typically be performing.
Other RPGs won’t give you any guidance at all. They’re designed
with expansive settings and mechanics that, at least hypothetically,
give you the tools to do anything you can imagine in them.
Jonathan Tweet’s Over the Edge, for example, takes place on the
Mediterranean island of Al Amarja, where every conspiracy theory
is true and every covert organization has converged to fight a proxy
battle for reality. You can do and be virtually anything there. Which
is incredibly cool! But also really daunting unless and until you
and/or your players nail down a more specific concept.
THE CAMPAIGN PITCH
A basic campaign concept can also serve as your pitch when
selling a new campaign to prospective players:
You’re space pirates trying to scrape together a living among
the backwater worlds of the Blue Nebula.

You’re wizards who have banded together to form a covenant
in the Black Forest of medieval Germany.
You’re professional dragonslayers, hunting wyrms among the
Greyspire Peaks.
If you’re playing with an established group that’s looking to
start a new campaign, it can be really effective to put together
three or four of these concepts and pitch them to the group.

Every concept should be something that you’re excited about
running, and offering them as choices to the group will make
sure that everyone else can be equally excited for what comes
next!

THE BRIEFING PACKET

The next thing you need is the player’s briefing packet. This
document contains the essential information about the campaign
setting that the players will need in order to create their characters
and character backgrounds.
The briefing packet is often dependent on the campaign concept,
but it’s not unusual for them to be developed in tandem. For
example, you might give the players broad information about what
the Mythic Europe setting of Ars Magica looks like so that they can
choose what region they want to establish a covenant in, and then,
based on that additional aspect of the campaign concept, pull
additional information about that specific region that will be
relevant to them.
You generally want to keep this briefing packet as concise as
possible. I’ve run campaigns, for example, where the briefing packet
was just one paragraph long. The upper limit, in my experience, is
about five pages. That’s roughly the length at which I can have a
reasonable expectation that most or all of the players will read it
before coming to the session, and if they don’t read it, it’s short
enough that they’ll be able to peruse it at the table without chewing
up too much time.
For certain cultural touchstones—if you’re playing in Middleearth or the Star Wars universe, for example—you might even
discover that a single sentence will work. (“You’re human rangers
working out of Rivendell” or “You’re agents of the Mos Eisley Police
Authority.”)
The key thing to remember is that you’re just looking to provide a
baseline. As players get excited about the setting and start

developing their characters, they will seek out more detailed
information (and care a lot more about it as a result).
If you’re creating a briefing packet for an original setting of your
own creation, check out the Quick-and-Dirty Worldbuilding extra
credit (see here) for tips.

CREATING CHARACTERS

Now that the players know what the campaign concept is and they
know enough about the setting to orient themselves, it’s time to
create your characters.
You can have all the players create their characters separately,
but if you’re creating characters for a long-term campaign, I
recommend having everyone do it together. You want to give
everybody an opportunity to weave their characters together. While
this kind of bond can be created over time through actual play, it’s
often much easier to do it as part of character creation, and it will
help get your first session off to a strong start. (This is sometimes
referred to as a Session 0, and in some cases—particularly if you’re
also collaborating on the campaign concept—it can even take a full
session. This is usually okay, as long as everyone’s expectations have
been set up for this.)
This doesn’t mean that everything needs to be done as a group.
One-on-one sessions allow the PCs to have secrets from each other
(which can be both dramatic and exciting!), and there will likely
come a point in the process, after the initial details have been
established and the group dynamic figured out, where it will simply
become more practical to continue the work one-on-one via email, a
Discord server, or the like, as described below.
In some esoteric cases it may even make sense for the players to
all create their characters in complete secrecy from each other, but
this creates a much larger burden on you, as the GM, to make sure
you end up with a cohesive group.
STEP 1: THE PLAYER’S CONCEPT

Start by turning the players loose to create whatever they want to
create.
In some cases the strictures of the campaign will tightly curtail
their options. For example, if the campaign is about a group of
teenagers who have manifested psychic abilities and been drafted
into a government special-ops team … well, then I’m expecting to
get back characters who are teenagers with psychic abilities.
In other cases, like most D&D campaigns, the players can have
pretty much carte blanche with their character concepts. (And you’ll
frequently be amazed by the stunningly original ideas they bring to
the table.)
Either way, it’s not unusual for a player to challenge the
assignment. For example, they might say, “Can I actually create the
government handler assigned to the teenage psychics?” or “What if
my psychic time-slip ability has prematurely aged me so that I look
middle-aged even though my character is only 13?” Sometimes this
just won’t work (there’s a reason why the campaign concept is set
up in a specific way), but my inclination is, as it so often is, to
default to yes and see if there’s a way that we can make it work.
Often this turns out to be to the campaign’s benefit in ways that I
could never anticipate. For example, I once ran a D&D campaign
where one of my few instructions was that none of the characters
should be from the city where the campaign was set. I knew that the
first session would begin with the PCs waking up with partial
amnesia and the first chunk of the campaign, therefore, would be
about them exploring the city and trying to find their bearings. I
didn’t want any of them to already be familiar with the city because
I felt the disorientation was important.
During character creation, one of the players was drawn to the
background details about the local elves, so her character—an elf
named Tithenmamiwen—ended up being from the city after all …
and it turned out I’d been completely wrong. Having one character
who was familiar with the city and had contacts there, but who was
completely alienated from everything and everyone she knew as a

result of the partial amnesia, was far more compelling than what I’d
originally envisioned.
In any case, once you’ve got the character concepts back from
your players, the next step is integrating those concepts into the
campaign. There are actually two parts to this process, which I’ll
refer to as the public integration and the private integration.
WHAT ABOUT THE GAME MECHANICS?
The rulebook for whatever RPG you’re playing will walk you
through the character creation mechanics step by step. Just
follow that procedure and you should be fine.
The one thing that may come up is if a player has a strong
concept for their character that isn’t quite supported by the
available rules. As a new GM, you’re perfectly justified to say,
“Since we’re just learning the game, I’d be more comfortable if
we stuck with the rules right now.” But often it’ll be just fine if
you tweak things a bit. Another good phrase to remember here
is: “We’ll try this, but we may need to make adjustments later
to get the balance right.”
STEP 2: PUBLIC INTEGRATION
The public integration is where I collaborate with the player to work
the character more deeply into the cultural and historical aspects of
the campaign world. There are a couple reasons for this: First,
bouncing ideas back and forth tends to just inherently encourage
more deeply imagined characters. Second, the player rarely knows
as much about the campaign setting as I do (even if it’s a published
campaign setting), so the collaboration is both a way of leveraging
my own expertise for the character’s benefit and also a way of
introducing the player to more of the setting.
The actual process of integration will vary quite a bit from one
character to the next. Our starting point, of course, is whatever the
player’s initial concept is, which can be anything from a few

sentences to a dozen pages of detailed background or even more.
What I’m generally looking for are specific details about the
character that can either be made more specific, given a deeper
context, connected to other elements of the campaign world, or all
of the above.
For example, you might have a player who says, “My character is
a knight.”
Let’s start by making that detail more specific by offering three
specific orders of knighthood that the player could choose for their
PC to be a member of:
Order of the Adamantine Band
Brotherhood of the Blade
Knights of the Silver Serpent

(In practice, each of these would also be accompanied by a short
description so that the player could understand the choice they were
making.)
We can also give that detail a deeper context by providing details
on the history and beliefs of the knighthood. Here’s an example that
I’ve used in my own campaign:
THE WAY OF KNIGHTHOOD
Any order of knighthood has three things in common.
1. They follow the Code of Law as laid down in the Book of
Athor.
2. They adhere to the Martial Code as laid down in the Book of
Itor.
3. They honor the Seven Compassions as laid down in the Book
of Crissa.
The Code of Law is your bedrock “thou shalt not” stuff: Don’t
murder, steal, enslave your brother, and so forth.

The Martial Code is essentially your standard chivalric ideal:
Face your opponent fairly and honorably.
The Seven Compassions are a bit more philosophically
complex, and are also referred to in some commentaries as the
Seven Cares. The compassions are of the self, the companion,
the stranger, the task, the thought, the memory, and the true.
In other words, care for yourself, for your companions, and for
strangers. Take care with what you do and what you think, and
it shall be remembered. And if you can do all that, then you
will know true compassion. (For most people, the Seven
Compassions boil down to “be nice to people” and “think
before you act.”)
Collectively these are also known as the Way of Knighthood.
You can see how this type of detail can immediately give the
player raw fodder for roleplaying their character. Now they don’t
have to just talk vaguely about chivalric ideals, they can invent
quotes from the Book of Athor or give their opponent mercy in
accordance with the Martial Code.
We can also link these orders of knighthood or the PC’s
relationship with them to other elements of the campaign world:
The Knights of the Silver Serpent might be vassals of the Imperial
Church, for example, or the PC could have been recommended to
the Brotherhood of the Blade by a noble family with strong ties to
the order.
In many cases, particularly if we’re playing in a world of my own
creation, these are not even details of the setting that previously
existed. Prompted by the PC’s background, I’m seizing the
opportunity to add depth to the campaign world. (And, crucially, it’s
depth precisely aimed at an area of the campaign world that one of
the PCs will be connected to and that the player is likely to be very
interested in.)
You also don’t need to overthink this. It’s often as simple as the
player saying, “I want to play the cleric of a god of war.” And then

you say, “The god of war is Itor.”
Just because you can add details about how the Church of Itor
operates; what the history of the church is; what the religious
uniforms of the church are; what the holy symbol of the god is; and
so forth doesn’t mean that you need to or even should.
Crucially, this process is not about me, as the GM, trying to
impose my concept on the character. My goal is to work with the
player to enrich and enable their concept. It’s not a one-sided
process, and we’ll likely go back and forth several times. If the
player wants to develop the details of an original knightly order for
their character to belong to, you should absolutely leap at that
opportunity. (And the collaboration now becomes a matter of how
that knightly order can be integrated into the wider campaign
world.)
Similarly, I always try to leave the final say with the player. For
example, if they come to me with a knight and I send them back a
couple of pages about the Knights of the Silver Serpent, I’ll try to
make a point of asking, “Does that sound right?”
If it isn’t, we’ll try to figure out where I misinterpreted the
character concept and try to find a solution that works. (This is also
why I like to give them options and then develop the option they
choose.)
BETWEEN THE SESSIONS
Somewhere early in the public integration phase (after a few
key questions and basic options have been resolved, like which
order of knighthood the character belongs to) is where I’ll
usually wrap up in-person character creation and move the
process to email or chat. This is ideal because it’s a format that
allows me to pull chunks of information from my setting
documents to share and also one that allows the players to
think about and carefully develop their character.
The end goal of this back-and-forth is to produce and/or have
the player produce a definitive “Character Background”

document. A typical length, with the kind of development
process described here, is two or three pages, although it’s not
unusual for some players to take it further than that.
STEP 3: GM’S INTEGRATION
For all intents and purposes, the character is now ready to go. But as
the GM, I’m not finished. At this point, I’ll start figuring out how to
hook the character into the larger structure of the campaign.
Is there a major villain in the second act? Make it the long-lost
brother of one of the PCs.

Is there a kidnapping victim in the third adventure? Make it the
mentor of one of the PCs.
Was I planning to have a corrupt order of wizards? Give one of
the PCs a chance to join it.

And so forth.
It’s about figuring out how to make the campaign about the
characters instead of just involving the characters.
STEP 4: BRINGING THE PARTY TOGETHER
Technically, this isn’t a separate step. It’s something that should be
taken into consideration throughout the entire character creation
process.
What binds these disparate characters together?
Whether the PCs are delving into dungeons, investigating eldritch
horrors, sailing the Astral Sea, or trying to protect the Feyish Court,
they need some reason why they are sticking together and working
with each other.
Fortunately, it’s not solely your responsibility, as the game
master, to explain this. As they’re creating the group, make sure the
players figure out why all these characters are hanging out together.
What background do they share?

What goal do they have in common?
What secret do they all share?

What organization do they all work for?

What emotional connections do they have to each other?
Once you know what makes them a group, you can hang your
scenario hooks off it (see here). This works even if their connection
seems mundane and unrelated to whatever the scenario is. For
example, let’s say they decide they all work at the same comic book
store. Great, now you can threaten the store. Or have some strange
person/creature come to the store. Or maybe the whole structure of
the campaign becomes tracking down rare issues of comic books for
resale, and the weird people, places, and estate sales they go to also
get them tangled up in whatever the scenario happens to be.
If they all share a dark secret, then a scenario hook just needs to
threaten that secret in some way to pull them all in. Or they can all
be blackmailed by the same mysterious patron.
Note that not all of the characters need to be bound together by a
single reason. For example, two of the characters might be a brother
and a sister, bound together by their family connection, while the
sister and all of the other PCs work together.
Also, just because the players are all collectively figuring out what
binds their characters together, this doesn’t necessarily mean that
the characters all know each other when the game begins! For
example, they might all want to find the Ruby Eye of Drosnin or
figure out the Truth about the Templars and be actively pursuing
that without necessarily pursuing it together. (At least, not at first.)
You may also find it useful to provide the players with a simple,
open-ended seed to focus their mutual intent around. The scenario
hook for the first adventure is a great place to start. For example, I
ran a campaign where I told the players:
The first scene of the campaign will be your characters walking
through the doors of the Red Hand tavern in Dweredell to meet a
contact who’s offering you a job.

You need to figure out how you all ended up there together.
If you were launching your campaign with Mephits & Magmin,
you might ask the players to explain how they all ended up together
in the small village near Firebelch Cavern.
CAMPAIGN STRUCTURE
As you’re developing the concept for your campaign, you’ll also
want to give some thought to the campaign structure you
want to use in building it.
Broadly speaking, a campaign structure is the way in which the
individual scenarios of a campaign are associated with each
other and, importantly, how the PCs are expected to go from
one scenario to another.
A simple structure is the episodic campaign, in which the GM
presents one scenario to the players, they play it, and then the
GM presents another scenario. You’ll need to give the PCs a
scenario hook at the beginning of each new scenario (see here).
(A common variant is to use one or more patrons who either
hire the PCs as freelancers or act as their boss to send them on
missions, thus creating a default method for giving the group
scenario hooks.)
If you want options that are a little more dynamic, or that
empower the players, you might also check out node-based
campaigns (see here), hexcrawls (see here), pointcrawsl (see
here), or urbancrawls (see here) as alternative campaign
structures.

CAMPAIGN STATUS
DOCUMENTS
Campaigns are a collection of scenarios. There are a lot of structures
that can be used for organizing those scenarios—it might be a
purely episodic campaign (one scenario after another), a node-based
campaign (see here), or a hexcrawl (see here)—but ultimately what
you have, figuratively or literally, is a binder full of scenarios.
A lot of the details of the campaign, therefore, will be found in
your scenario notes.
But where do you keep track of all the stuff that isn’t part of a
specific scenario? Or that was part of a scenario that wrapped up,
but is still floating around like a free radical affecting the PCs
and/or the setting? (For example, a bad guy who escaped and has
sworn vengeance on the PCs. Or a demonic plague that was
accidentally released into the city. Or an NPC that one of the PCs
has fallen in love with.)
There’s where the campaign status document comes into play.
(Literally.)
Rather than keeping notes attached to a dozen different scenarios,
you can rope all the active elements of your campaign together into
this single document and then update it after each session. In this
way, it becomes the default repository for the evolving canon of the
campaign. It’s arguably the single most important document I have
at the table during play. It’s always kept close at hand and is
ultimately the guide I use to keep the campaign on track.
It’s also kind of my secret weapon as a GM. How can I run these
huge, sprawling, complicated campaigns without getting lost? I have
a road map. I use the campaign status document as a cheat sheet,
offloading the mental load to my downtime between sessions so that

at the actual table I can stay focused on execution and active play
rather than the logistics of continuity.
The campaign status document, however, is not a one-size-fits-all
tool. Every single campaign is unique, and I’ve found that to be
reflected in each campaign’s status document. It often takes me
three or four sessions with a new campaign before I can really start
grokking what the status document for that campaign is going to
look like.
With that being said, there are three elements that form the core
of most campaign status documents:
scenario updates

the timeline of bangs
background events

SCENARIO UPDATES

Once you begin running a scenario, the actions of the PCs will begin
to transform that scenario, and then the reactions of the NPCs to
what the PCs have done will transform it even further.
A simple example: The PCs kill all the skeletons in Area 7. Now
there are no skeletons in Area 7.
Each active scenario in the campaign—i.e., each scenario that the
PCs have been interacting with and for which continuity needs to be
tracked—gets its own section. If the PCs are currently in the Caverns
of Doom, I want to remember that they killed the skeletons in Area
7 last session so that they don’t miraculously reappear in this
session. If they’re leaving the Caverns of Doom but are planning to
come back later, it’s even more important to keep track of all those
little details that could otherwise easily get lost.
Dungeons actually make for a fairly clear-cut example of this, so
let’s take a peek at how I track dungeon status. There are basically
four tools I use:
adversary rosters

updated room keys
scenario timelines

return to a status quo
The first thing is that, as with everything else in the campaign
status document, you can and should keep it simple. Just because
you have all of these tools available for tracking dungeon status, it
doesn’t mean that you need to use all of them all of the time. For
example, here’s what the status looked like for a dungeon in one of
my campaigns:

MISTKEEP

B5: Ogre killed.

B12: Paintings removed from the walls.
That’s all I needed given the changes the PCs had made up to that
point! The more stuff the PCs do—and the more stuff they change—
of course, the more notes you’ll need.
Using adversary rosters (see here) makes it easy to track
casualties, reinforcements, or other changes to the denizens of the
dungeon. During actual play, you can easily update the roster as
necessary (e.g., crossing off casualties) and then, between sessions,
simply update the roster, putting the current version in the scenario
update and ignoring the original when the PCs return to the
dungeon.
The other half of a dungeon, of course, is the room keys. We
discussed updating these keys in detail on page 165, but the short
version is that you simply list each room where something has been
changed (destroyed, looted, etc.) and note the changes. I
recommend using bullet points to keep this pithy and easy to
reference.
If the disrupted scenario is in a highly agitated state but you’re
not sure exactly when the PCs will reengage with it, a scenario
timeline may come in useful. Basically, this is just a list indicating

that at such-and-such a time the adversary roster and/or room key
will be updated. A simple example is when the bad guys have
summoned reinforcements but they won’t arrive for a little while
and it’s possible the PCs will come back for a second assault before
they get there. In this situation, you would create an adversary
roster without the reinforcements, and then use the timeline to
indicate when they should be added to the adversary roster. If the
PCs don’t come back, then the next time you’re updating your
campaign status document, you can add the reinforcements and
remove the timeline entry.
A timeline, therefore, might look something like this:
10/05/790: Tee attacks Temple of Dissolution.

10/06/790: Tee uses Dreaming Arts to unleash nightmare on
Arveth, leaving her fatigued next day.
10/07/790: Arveth hits Tee with Dreamspike.

10/08/790: Tee unleashes nightmare on Arveth, leaving her
fatigued next day.

10/09/790: Arveth switches sleeping pattern so that she won’t be
asleep at night.
10/10/790 (4 AM): Arveth hits Tee with Dreamspike (forced to
watch her friends’ eyes ripped out).

□ 10/10/790 (11 PM): Rissien and Santiel are kidnapped from
Narred and taken to Temple of Dissolution.
10/13/790: Santiel is blinded.
10/14/790: Santiel’s eyes delivered to Tee.
10/15/790: Santiel is killed.

10/16/790: Rissien suspended in the Prismatic Altar.

10/21/790: Rissien is killed. (Possibly rescued by the Jade Oak.)
I use strikeout text to indicate events that have already happened,
including some events from actual play for easy reference. In some
cases I’ll simply delete these items (for clarity or to save space), but

I’ve often found it useful to be able to look back and review what’s
been happening in an evolving scenario.
It follows, of course, that events that haven’t been struck out
haven’t happened yet. They may, in fact, never happen. (If, for
example, Tee catches up with Arveth before she can kidnap Rissien
and Santiel.)
As you’re working with timelines, therefore, there are a couple
questions that are useful to keep in mind:
1. When is it likely that the PCs will reengage with the dungeon? (I
won’t prep timelines much beyond this point because the
likelihood of wasted prep becomes high.)
2. If the PCs don’t interact further with this dungeon, what will be
the new status quo?
The latter question can be easy to overlook, but it’s really an
essential component of efficient, smart prep. Some situations will
continue to spiral out of control, spinning their chaos out into the
rest of the campaign, but most scenarios will instead settle down
into a status quo (e.g., the mafiosos bring in new muscle to guard
their drug operation and then … that’s it, they’ve taken the
precautions they think they need to take). This means that you can
simply prep up to that new status quo, file it in the appropriate
section of your campaign notes, and then stop thinking about it
until it becomes relevant again.
(For a deeper look at status quo design, see here.)

THE TIMELINE OF BANGS

A bang, described in detail on page 211, is the explosive moment
that you use to start a new scene. Stripping the jargon from it, the
timeline of bangs is basically a list of events that are going to
happen to the PCs in the future. In other words, the places where
the active campaign world is going to seek them out instead of
waiting to react to them.

Any type of bang can be put on the timeline, but there are a few
types that I find common.
Appointments are added to the timeline when the PCs make an
arrangement to do something. They’re your reminder that
something has been scheduled. The PCs are often aware of the what,
where, and when, but that won’t always be true: Sometimes you
whisper to a butterfly and you just can’t be sure when the giant
eagle will show up.
Scenario hooks, which are described in more detail in their own
extra credit (see here), can be dropped into the campaign to pull or
push PCs toward a new scenario (or reengage them with a scenario
they’ve been ignoring). For example, a client showing up at the PCs’
detective agency with a job.
Roleplaying prompts are a broad category that can be generally
understood as “an important NPC shows up for a big scene.” Maybe
your brother comes looking for cash or your boyfriend calls and
says, “We have to talk.”
Event fallout covers the myriad ways in which the game world
reacts to the PCs.
In many ways, a GM’s entire role at the table can be described as
providing the world’s response to the PCs’ actions. “You do X,
therefore Y happens. Now what do you do?” This is relatively easy
to maintain and keep track of in the normal course of play as
reactions happen in more or less immediate succession: You swing
your sword at the orc and we immediately learn whether or not you
hit them.
But in some cases, the reaction will be delayed. Or the PCs will
knock over a chain of dominos that continue to topple off-screen:
They leave evidence of their break-in and the Herschfelds begin an
investigation. They retrieve a powerful artifact and deliver it to one
of the heirs of the throne. They write a letter to their contact in
Paris and must wait for a transatlantic response.
If the response is a single event, it can just go directly on the
timeline of bangs. For example, when the PCs in one of my D&D
campaigns fought a demon, got coated in demonic filth, and then

teleported directly back to their rooms, they ended up impregnating
the rug in their room with some of that filth. I decided that the filth
would fester for several days before generating a half dozen
demonic maggots. It would have been easy to lose track of this cool
idea, since it wouldn’t happen for several sessions, but I simply
included it on the timeline of bangs. Once there, the event could
simply sit and wait until it was triggered at the appropriate time.
If a chain of dominos is falling, on the other hand, then you might
want to list that sequence of events as a separate, dedicated
timeline, with events on that timeline that intersect with the PCs (or
could intersect with the PCs) being cross-referenced on your
primary timeline of bangs.
In fact, you might create separate, specialized sections like this in
your campaign status document for any entry on your timeline of
bangs. (For example, those demonic maggots needed stat blocks,
which I listed in a separate “Demonic Maggots” section.) In my
experience, you want to keep the timeline itself as uncluttered as
possible so that it can fulfill its primary function of making sure you
don’t miss something or forget an event.
These specialized sections can often function like mini-scenarios
(e.g., the mini-scenario of your rooms becoming infested with
demonic maggots). If these become sufficiently complicated, though,
they should be spun off into a full-fledged set of scenario notes
(which can, of course, be cross-referenced and triggered in your
timeline of bangs). If you’re looking for a rule of thumb, anything
longer than a single page should almost certainly be spun off, and
I’ll usually try to keep these to a half page or less.
Timelines of bangs, in my experience, are usually organized
chronologically, which might look like this:
9/22/2057: Vargas offers a case to Ashlorn. (Case 8: Vargas
Kidnapping)

9/22/2057 (10 AM): Rachana’s press conference scheduled.
(Lytekkas Hypercorp)

9/22/2057 (Evening): The Neo-Stasi identify “Ashlorn” as
Zubaida. They attack the mansion. (Ashlorn’s Doom)
9/23/2057: Olga’s Training.

9/23/2057: Receive invitation from the Hélia Corporation to beta
test the Cryoworld expansion. (Case 9: Cryoworld)
9/24/2057: Rachana’s rocket-propelled grenade launcher
delivered.

You can see how events can be keyed to days (in which case they
could be triggered at any time on that day), specific times, or
something in between (e.g., Evening). You can also see how I use
parentheses at the end of a bang to indicate that it’s linked to a
scenario (e.g., Vargas Kidnapping, Lytekkas Hypercorp, Cryoworld)
or subsection of the campaign status document (e.g., Ashlorn’s
Doom) where additional information can be found.
Another chronological approach is to create a sequential
checklist. Bangs appear on the list in the order they’ll happen, but
without assigning specific dates or times to them:
Olga’s sister Aliona arrives in town. She needs help finding her
husband. (Case 10: Stanislav’s Run)
Rain of blood polyps falls from the sky. (Lytekkas Hypercorp)
Rachana: Check Black-IC installed on her deck.
Neo-Stasi kidnap Lalita. (Ashlorn’s Doom)

Spyware installed on Rachana’s RPG uploads data packet.
As you’re running your campaign, you can just move down the
list, checking off each bang as you use it.
A final option is to keep the checklist but ditch the sequencing.
This becomes a menu of bangs, basically a list of proactive
elements that you can select and drop into the campaign whenever
it feels appropriate.
You could even maintain multiple timelines of bangs if that seems
useful to you: one a chronological list of stuff keyed to specific times

and another that’s a more flexible list of bangs you can choose as
fancy and need dictate.

BACKGROUND EVENTS

Background events are a second timeline of future events running in
parallel with the timeline of bangs. These are the events that don’t
directly involve the PCs, but that are nevertheless taking place and
moving the campaign world forward.
If the PCs are playing FBI agents in New York City in 1944, for
example, then the D-Day invasion of Normandy would be a
background event. So, too, the race for US Senate between Robert F.
Wagner and Thomas J. Curran, and the release of Rosie the Riveter in
cinemas.
In my earliest campaign status documents, I didn’t separate these
two timelines from each other: Stuff that would be directly
experienced by the PCs and background headlines from the local
newspapers would be freely mixed together in a single timeline of
dates. This worked up to a certain point, but I eventually realized
that:
The two lists are actually used in distinct ways and at distinct
times during play, so having them directly juxtaposed wasn’t
providing any meaningful utility.

The timeline of bangs is, in many ways, a list of “things I don’t
want to forget to have happen.” The background events, on the
other hand, are factoids that the PCs have to seek out or that are
opportunistically used as backdrops. Mixing them together on the
same list sometimes resulted in the essential bangs getting lost
amidst the reactive background events, thus degrading the utility
of the list.
So although they’re superficially similar, insofar as they’re both
lists of ongoing events that are likely to happen as the campaign
world moves forward through time, they actually serve distinct
purposes and work better when split apart.

I’ll often frame background events as newspaper headlines or
broadsheet article summaries, with the PCs scooping them up
whenever they grab a copy of the paper. But you can also use your
background events as topics of conversation with NPCs or as
backdrop elements in other scenes (e.g., a chase scene that crashes
through a ticker-tape parade for the Mercury 7 astronauts, or a
television in the bar broadcasting the inaugural lift of the
Kilimanjaro space elevator).
Background events provide depth to the campaign, creating a
game world that exists and persists beyond the PCs’ immediate line
of sight. If the PCs reach a certain level or notoriety or get mixed up
in events with a high profile, though, it can be fun to seed in details
about how their exploits are being publicly reported.
It’s also not unusual for players to become interested in
background events and start poking their noses into them. If that
happens, you may discover that some background events will
blossom into full-fledged scenarios.

BACKDROP FILES

As the complexity of your campaign world grows, you’ll likely
discover that some of your background events will develop into
significant sub-narratives. For example, the D-Day invasion wasn’t a
one-off: There was a long war before it and plenty of war after it, a
whole sequence of background events that build and develop over
time (and potentially provide vital context for any number of
scenarios).
When this happens, I find it useful to create backdrop files:
separate documents that each track a separate sub-narrative. For
example, in our hypothetical FBI campaign set in 1944, I might
create:
Backdrop 1: World War II
Backdrop 2: Senate Race

Backdrop 3: New in Cinemas

And so forth.
These backdrop files usually consist simply of the same short
bullet-pointed items found in the Background Events section of the
campaign status document (with the occasional additional detail for
PCs who go digging for them), but prepping them separately makes
it much easier to coherently weave those events together.
Offloading this material into backdrop files also allows me to
archive older events and also far-future events while keeping the
campaign status document itself as slim as possible. Then I can
simply transfer events from my various backdrop files as needed.
For example, the status document for my current D&D campaign
reads:
NEWSSHEETS (Backdrops updated through 10/27)
Which is a reminder to myself that, when we get close to the 27th of
Nocturdei in the campaign, I should go through all my backdrop
files, pull out another 5 to 10 days of material from those timelines,
and add them to the campaign status document.
ARCHIVE YOUR STATUS DOCUMENT!
When it’s time to update my campaign document for a new session,
I make a point of saving the old version of the document in an
archive.
To keep your campaign status document functional, you’ll be
constantly purging irrelevant and out-of-date material from it.
Sometimes, though, you’ll make a mistake and delete something
that’s still relevant … or that suddenly becomes relevant again 20
sessions later.
Take the hard lesson from my mistakes: Keep an archive of your
status documents!

LEARNING A NEW RPG
So you’re getting ready to GM a new RPG for the first time. That can
be a little intimidating. Maybe it’s the first RPG you’ve ever played.
Or it’s a little more complex than anything you’ve run before. Or it’s
your first time prepping a game you haven’t previously played. Or
it’s just something new.
In any case, you’ll obviously want this process to go smoothly,
and you’ll want to make as few mistakes as possible. (Although Step
0 here is accepting that mistakes will happen, and that’s okay. That’s
part of the process.)
STEP 1: READ THE RULEBOOK
Cover to cover. I’m afraid there’s no cheating around this and no
shortcuts. If you’re lucky, the RPG you’ve chosen will have a wellorganized rulebook, but the process of mentally “touching” every
page of the book will not only prevent you from missing a rule
entirely, it will also begin constructing a mental map of the
rulebook that will allow you to look up information inside it more
quickly during play.
STEP 2: CHEAT SHEETS
Make a cheat sheet including the most important rules. I like to
include all the mechanics except for character options and format
my sheets so that I can display them on my GM screen. It’s real easy
to fake mastery of a rule system when you have it all laid out six
inches in front of your face. The act of creating the cheat sheet also
enhances your own learning process: It involves “touching” every
part of the system a second time, and also requires you to mentally
engage with the system and really understand what makes it tick.
The truth is that a lot of RPGs can be pretty terrible when it
comes to technical writing, and the act of boiling messy text into a

clear cheat sheet will lead you to pre-solve difficult cruxes that
would otherwise booby trap you during play. The cheat sheet will
also often susses out those weird rules that RPG manuals leave lying
around in dank corners.
You can find examples of these cheat sheets for a variety of
systems
on
my
website,
the
Alexandrian
(https://thealexandrian.net).
STEP 3: RUN A ONE-SHOT
If I’m interested in running a long-term campaign in a given system,
I’ll almost never start by jumping directly into that campaign.
Instead, I’ll run a one-shot, usually with pre-generated characters (so
that we can jump right in).
Running the one-shot allows both me and the players to work out
the kinks, and the players gain a lot of understanding of how the
game works that will prove invaluable when it comes time to create
their long-term characters.
The result is better characters and a stronger first session, both of
which will help get the campaign off on the right foot.
STEP 4: CO-OPT PLAYER EXPERTISE
Do this in every way you can. That includes, “Bob, can you look up
the rule for pugilating people?” It also includes, “Anybody know the
rules for pugilating people?” (instead of defaulting to looking it up
yourself).
There’s sneakier stuff, too, like, “I can’t figure out how to beat the
PCs when they use ability X, so I’m going to design a bunch of bad
guys who use ability X and I’ll see how the players deal with it.”
BRIBE YOUR ASSISTANTS!
My editor, Elliot, recommends a technique used by their GM: Give
XP to the first player who can find or remember a rule you’ve
forgotten!

STEP 5: RULES HIGHLIGHT SESSIONS
For any game like D&D that has a lot of specialized sub-systems,
consider designing sessions that highlight one of those sub-systems
over and over and over again so that you can, as a group, get a lot
of focused repetition using it.
Often groups struggle with these sub-systems because they only
come up once every four or five sessions, which means every time
you need to use them you’ve forgotten the last time you muddled
through them, and you end up needing to muddle your way through
them all over again. Having problems with grappling? A whole
scenario based around grasping gorillas and their pet pythons will
usually lock those rules in permanently for the group. (Which also
means you’ll have increased expertise across the entire group, which
you can co-opt in the future.)
STEP 6: SET A REFERENCE TIME LIMIT
If you find yourself getting frequently bogged down in the new
rules, set a time limit. If you can’t find the answer you’re looking for
in 30 seconds (or 60 seconds or whatever feels right to you), make
an arbitrary ruling and move on. Be open and clear about what
you’re doing with the players, and make a note to review those rules
after the session. Then, before the next session, review the correct
rules with the whole group.
STEP 7: IDENTIFY YOUR HIERARCHY OF REFERENCE
As you’re prepping your scenario notes, particularly when it comes
to stat blocks, try to include everything you personally need to
reference on the page. Where the system cheat sheet gives you the
core rules at your fingertips, this technique puts the relevant class
abilities, superpowers, creature features, and similar characterspecific abilities that are pertinent to the current situation at your
fingertips.
Over time, you will master more and more of the system and no
longer need the immediate reference. When that happens, you can
simply scale down the reference. For example, when you first start
playing D&D you won’t have any idea what a magic missile spell is.

Eventually, though, you’ll become familiar enough with it that just
seeing the name of the spell will be enough.
This often follows the hierarchy of reference:
Include the full text.

Include a brief summary of the most important factors (and a
page reference in case you end up needing to look up the details).
Include just a page reference.

Simply list the keyword, spell name, feat, etc.
Move down the hierarchy as you gain more and more mastery
over the system you’re running. It’s kind of like using vocab cards to
learn a new language (except you never need to spend time
memorizing them; just playing the game does that for you
organically)—as you master each concept, you simply cycle them
out of the rotation.
Including the full text for something has become really easy in an
era of copy-and-paste. But having such a large bulk of text is not
always the best option for quickly referencing something during
play. And if you’re dealing with lots of different abilities or effects,
including the full text for every single one of them will often bloat
your content to the point where it becomes more difficult to use
(because, for example, you’re having to flip between multiple pages
in order to run an encounter).

TEACHING A NEW RPG

As the GM you are likely the one who chose the game you’re
playing and, therefore, will often have more expertise with the rules
than any of the other players. It’s your responsibility and your
privilege to share that knowledge with the players. (Plus, it’s just a
good idea because it will make the players feel better and help the
game run smoother.)
First, make sure that the players have access to a copy of the
rulebook at the table. I’ll often try to have a second copy of the

rulebook just for the players because I don’t want my own access to
the book cut off while a player is referencing something, but that’s
not strictly necessary. In most groups, it won’t be unusual for one or
more of the players to buy their own copies.
Second, give them a copy of your cheat sheet. I usually make a
copy for every player.
Third, prep a 5-to-10-minute introduction to the game, using your
cheat sheet as a reference. You don’t have to overthink or literally
script this. Just make a bullet point list of the topics you want to
cover, identifying the core concepts (like how action checks are
resolved) that you need to explain.
If it’s a relatively simple RPG, you might actually touch on all of
the rules in this introduction, but that’s not necessary. Focus on
getting the key essentials across, and then be aware during the
actual game of moments when new mechanics show up for the first
time and take the time to explain them (once again referencing the
cheat sheet).

THE OPEN TABLE
Imagine that you had never heard of baseball before and someone
said, “Hey, wanna join a baseball team?”
“What’s that involve?” you ask.
“Well, we practice three hours every Wednesday evening and
we’ll have a game every Saturday afternoon for the next seven
months.”
You’d have to be really, really curious about baseball to take that
guy up on his offer, right? And if you actually made that
commitment and were on that baseball team, then the quality of

your team would probably be really important and you’d need to be
really convinced that someone was going to make a great baseball
player before you’d invite them to join you, right? Plus, it’s such a
huge commitment of your time that it would be incredibly difficult
for you to commit to two different baseball teams, so at a certain
point you’d just play baseball with the people on your team and
you’d stop inviting other people to play with you because all the
roster spots on your team were full and there’d be no room for
anyone else.
If that was the only way people could start playing baseball, it’s
pretty easy to see that you wouldn’t have a lot of baseball players.
Of course, that’s not how people start playing baseball. Most
people start playing baseball when somebody says, “Hey, wanna
play catch?” And playing catch is easy. You pick up a ball and you
throw it. There’s no commitment, so people will be more open to
trying it and inviting others to do it with them. Some people, of
course, will never pick that ball up again. But lots of people will
find that they like throwing the ball around, and some of those
people will eventually find themselves agreeing to spend three
hundred hours every year participating in amateur baseball leagues.

THE DEDICATED TABLE

When it comes to roleplaying games, the equivalent to the amateur
baseball league is what I’ve come to call a dedicated table. It’s the
way most people play RPGs today: They have a regular group of five
or six people who plan to get together on a regular or semi-regular
basis for ten or twenty or more sessions.
When you agree to join a campaign like this, you’re making a
minimum commitment of 80 hours or more spread out over months
or years of your life. Dropping out or frequently missing sessions is
usually considered bad form, since losing a player (and, therefore,
their character) can be incredibly disruptive to the tightly woven
continuity of the modern campaign.

And that level of commitment can result in truly amazing things.
For example, I ran an Eternal Lies campaign for the Trail of Cthulhu
roleplaying game that lasted for 95 hours spread across 22 sessions
of play, and that amount of time allowed us to explore a deep and
interesting scenario while creating well-rounded characters who
changed and grew over time. I’ve also got a D&D campaign that’s
been running as a dedicated table for more than 15 years and, once
again, the commitment of time and focus unlocks creative options
that simply would not be possible in purely casual play. (Just like a
baseball team that practices together regularly is going to be more
skilled in their collective play than a pickup team that plays for a
single afternoon.)
But this mode of play also comes at a cost. Part of that cost can be
personal: There are lots of people who talk about how they can’t
play RPGs anymore because they just don’t have the time to commit
to them. Another part of that cost comes from the incredible
difficulty of inviting new players to join your dedicated table,
particularly if they’re completely new to roleplaying games (since
there’s no way to know whether or not they’ll like the game enough
to stick with the significant commitment you’re asking of them).
What’s unfortunate is that many people believe that this is a cost
that must be paid in order to play an RPG, and if they can’t pay that
cost, they conclude that they can’t play RPGs anymore (or at all).
But there is another option.

THE OPEN TABLE

An open table is built around (a) campaign material that’s set up so
that you can run the game with little or no prep and (b) open group
formation, so that you can play a session with any combination of
players. In combination, this means that, just like a board game, you
can play the game at basically any time. In fact, you can play it on
the spur of the moment.
This is awesome.

It’s awesome for you because you never have to worry about
wrangling schedules. Feel like playing on Thursday? Just send out
an email saying, “We’re playing on Thursday. Who wants to come?”
and you’re good to go. Just hanging out with some friends and
you’re trying to figure out what to do? Normally you’d never
suggest an RPG because of the prep time involved, but with an open
table you can always just pick it up and start playing.
This also makes an open table the ultimate recruitment tool for
finding new players (see here). Even if they only play the one time,
they can have a great experience without causing any disruption to
“continuity.” You may even be thinking that you can’t make an
open table work because you don’t have enough players. But when
you actually have an open table, you’ll be astonished at how quickly
you can end up with more players than you know what to do with.
For my first open table, I started with an email list of eight or nine
players. Within a couple of months that list had grown to more than
thirty. Today, I have more than sixty people in my pool of active
players. And that’s only possible because the open table makes the
recruitment of new players so easy.
This is also why an open table can be fantastic even if you prefer
the focus and intensity of a dedicated campaign: The open table is
how you find the high-quality, enthusiastic players who make truly
great dedicated campaigns possible. That awesome Eternal Lies
campaign I ran? I first played with several key members of that
group through my open table. And when I needed a replacement
player in my long-running D&D campaign I knew exactly where to
find her, because for months she’d been proving herself to be the
perfect player for that campaign at my open table.
With an open table I can play with more people, I can play more
frequently, I can use it as an incubator for testing out new ideas in a
low-risk environment, and it improves all of my gaming, both open
and dedicated.
If you love roleplaying games, I really believe you owe it to
yourself to keep an open table in your back pocket. Here are some
ways you can make your table an open one.

INTO THE MEGADUNGEON

There are many different ways that you can set up an open table,
but one of the most straightforward is a classic megadungeon (see
here).
Start with the campaign concept (see here): The PCs are dungeondelving adventurers based out of a town near (or, alternatively,
directly on top of) the megadungeon. Each session, a group of PCs
will form an expedition that will journey down into the dungeon.
(See Expedition-Based Play, on.)
You’ll need to create the town. It could be anything from a small
village to a sprawling metropolis. A small frontier fort is another
option, or you could go for something truly unusual like an airship
or a transplanar nexus that can be reached by anyone with the
appropriate token.
You’ll also, of course, need to create the megadungeon itself. See
Starting a Megadungeon on page 174. (Remember that you don’t
need the full megadungeon, just the first three levels.)
As you’re designing this, it may be useful to recognize that the
dynamic is fundamentally similar to a gold rush. Over time, players
will find a wide variety of personal reasons and goals for delving
into the dungeon, but it’s very likely that the reason the
megadungeon attracts so many different adventurers is the golden
allure of treasure. So think about the kinds of communities that are
created by gold rushes.

SCHEDULING SESSIONS

With your megadungeon in place, it’s time to open your table.
You will, of course, still need to start with some players. Offer the
open table to anyone you’re playing with or have played with in the
past. Do the normal recruitment things (see here). Suggest a
dungeon delve at your next board game night. Opportunistically ask
your geeky friends, “Would you like to try playing D&D?”
I recommend setting up a mailing list, Discord server, social
media group, or some similar community for the open table. You’ll

want to be able to send out session invites to everyone interested,
and ideally you also want to give the players a forum for sharing
information and chatting with each other away from the table.
TABLE CAPS AND WAITING LISTS
My first forays into an open table featured a simple “We’ll play
with whoever shows up!” ethos. As the popularity of the open
table grew, however, this quickly became nonviable: I had one
session in which I GMed for ten players running something like
22 PCs and hirelings.
Then I imposed table caps.
The system is pretty simple: I cap the number of players at a
certain number. (For me, that’s five players and I’ll allow a
sixth if it’s for a couple playing together. Your mileage may
vary.) These slots fill up on a first-come, first-serve basis. Once
the cap is hit, that’s it for that session.
To prevent highly active players from monopolizing the slots at
every session, I also use a waiting list: If you signed up for a
session but couldn’t play because of the session cap, then you
get preferential placement in the next session. (The waiting list
also helps with last-minute cancellations, because you can call
up the next person on the waiting list.)
Now you can schedule a session. You can schedule an open call
by simply announcing the date and time of the game and asking the
players to RSVP. You can create a regular session by simply having
an open call on the same night each week or every other week (e.g.,
you play every Tuesday night).
Alternatively, specific players (or groups of players) can request a
sponsored session by approaching you and asking for it. Make sure
players know that they can do this. I’ll generally tell players that
they should offer me a range of dates and then I can figure out

which one works for me. It’s up to them whether they want the
sponsored session to also include an open call to fill any empty seats
or if it’s an “exclusive” event just for them.
Sponsored sessions can arise because of events in the game world
(e.g., “We want to go back to the Temple of Elemental Evil!” or “We
should retrieve Varla’s corpse” or “We need to go back for the rest
of that treasure before somebody else snatches it”) or the real world
(e.g., because Steve’s in town, for a bachelor party, we all happened
to be drunk at the time, or just because somebody was bored and
wanted something to do on a Thursday night).

RUNNING THE OPEN TABLE

Game night has arrived and the players who RSVP’d are taking their
seats at the table.
The first thing you need to do is form the group. Returning
players will need to choose which of their characters they want to
play tonight (they could have several) or if they want to create a
new 1st-level character.
This decision will often depend on what characters everyone else
is playing (Marko and Alonso have a blood feud, so if Cynthia is
playing Marko tonight, then Paul might not want to play Alonso …
or maybe he’ll definitely want to play Alonso!), what the players
want to do tonight (if they’re heading down to the Fields of Black
Diamonds, then Cynthia might prefer to play Kaden, who has an
interest in finding the Grey-Mantled King), and/or the relative
power levels of the characters (if everyone else is low-level, then
maybe Colleen tables her 8th-level character and rolls up a new
one). So expect a discussion to break out.
New players, of course, will need a new character. If they’re
completely new, then you’ll also need to introduce them to the
game system.
In terms of teaching the game, you need to prep a tight 5- or, at
most, 10-minute spiel. Check out the Learning a New RPG extra
credit on page 458 for some guidance on this, but it’s really

important that you don’t spend too much time on this, particularly
since in an open table you’ve almost certainly got other players
sitting there who don’t need the introduction.
When it comes to starting a new character, if you’re playing a
game with lightning-fast character creation that can be done even
by a neophyte in 5 or, again, 10 minutes at most, then you can just
have players create their characters at the table.
The current edition of D&D, unfortunately, is not such a game.
Therefore:
Encourage experienced players to create their character ahead of
time and bring it to their first session.

Create a bunch of pre-generated characters (also known as
pregens) and have a stack of sheets that other players can simply
pick from.
Some RPGs will actually provide a bunch of pregens. Use ’em! For
D&D, there are a bunch of online generators that you can use to
create a pregen with the push of a button. Some of those could also
be used to let players make some basic decisions about their
character—e.g., “I’d like to play an outlander tiefling sorcerer”—and
then generate the rest.
With the group formed, give them a chance to buy supplies in
town if they’d like and then head into the megadungeon! At this
point, you’re just running the adventure like you would any other.

ENDING THE SESSION

A key element of the open table is that, at the end of the session, the
PCs all need to be back at their home base so that they’re available
to participate in the open group formation at the beginning of the
next session.
Make sure to make this expectation explicit. You’re not trying to
pull a fast one here, and, in my experience, the players will be more
than happy to collaborate in making this happen.

Sometimes, of course, this just isn’t possible. Back in the real
world, people have to get up in the morning and they weren’t
anticipating getting completely lost after that teleportation trap on
Level 3. When this happens, you’ll probably just want to wave your
hand and say something like, “After a long journey, you manage to
make your way back to the surface.”
You might want to impose some form of penalty or consequence
when this happens, but as long as a good faith effort is made it’s
usually best to just let it slide.
Another option, though, is to offer a sequel session: If the
evening is coming to a close and the group is in the middle of
something important to them, then you can hit the pause button and
pick up where you’re leaving off if (and only if!) everyone at the
table can immediately agree on a time when everyone in the current
group can get together for another session. (I usually require this
session to happen within the next 10 days and/or before the next
regularly scheduled session, because it can be incredibly disruptive
to an open table to have characters unavailable for play because
they’re stuck somewhere.)

BETWEEN SESSIONS

After the session is done (and before the next one is done), restock
your dungeon (see here).
As I mentioned, one of the great things about an open table is that
it can allow you to just pick up and play a roleplaying game as
easily as you would a board game or video game. Megadungeons
make great open tables because (a) they’re designed to be so large
that they cannot be cleared out (so they’re always available for
play) and (b) their content can be trivially regenerated with some
simple restocking procedures.
When I’m running a megadungeon, it usually takes me less than
20 minutes to restock it between sessions (often much less). In fact,
with a little practice, you can get a little sneaky and take care of the

restocking at the beginning of the next session while the players are
picking out their characters and shopping for equipment.

OTHER OPEN TABLES

Megadungeons, of course, are not the be-all and end-all of open
tables. You could easily expand your megadungeon into an open
table based on a hexcrawl (see here), for example, and that’s barely
scratching the surface of the possibilities you can explore by
swapping genres, games, and campaign structures.
A few key things to look for in choosing a system and setting up a
campaign for an open table:
Quick character generation

A game system that can be quickly taught to new players

A mechanism for open group formation, explaining by default
how a semi-random assortment of PCs comes together for a new
mission/expedition each session
A default goal and default action that can set each session in
motion

Ideally a method for easily regenerating or extending adventure
content (although this can be replaced by a willingness to simply
generate a lot of one-shot adventures)
Have fun sharing all your wondrous worlds!

QUICK-AND-DIRTY
WORLDBUILDING

Want to create an entire world?
Sounds intimidating, doesn’t it? Just look at published settings
like Middle-earth, the Forgotten Realms, or Star Wars. Hundreds,
often thousands, of pages dedicated to describing a fictional reality.
Your first session is on Saturday! You don’t have time for that!
Of course, you don’t need to do all of that to start gaming in your
own setting. A detailed breakdown of the dialects spoken on the
Triskan subcontinent might be really fun to explore but is probably
not strictly necessary for a new campaign taking place in the
Sasharran archipelago.
The real secret is that if you can get your new world to the table,
then it will begin rapidly developing through actual play. Every
scenario you design and every session you run will build atop the
last. All you’ll have to do is keep good notes.
So what’s the minimum amount of stuff you’ll need before the
game begins?
In my experience, three to six pages.
Let’s break down what those look like.

THE MINIMUM PREP PACKET

Start with one to two pages of broad detail about the world. The
goal of this high-level summary is to provide context for whatever
local scene your campaign will end up starting in. The exact nature
of what this overview looks like will vary based on the setting, your
preferences, and probably the campaign you’re planning.
For example, my personal D&D campaign setting is the Western
Lands. If you look at it today, it actually does fill hundreds of pages
and gigabytes of data. But when I first started creating it two
decades ago, I wrote one page summarizing the five major empires
of the Western Lands (one paragraph per empire). Then I wrote a
one-page timeline of the setting’s history.
(I really did have a game on Saturday.)
For an urban fantasy campaign set in an alternative version of the
modern day, on the other hand, you might do one page on the true

nature of magic and another page on the major fey factions.
Whatever this content ends up needing to be for your campaign,
though, keep it to no more than two pages.
CALENDARS & TIMEKEEPING
Make sure to include a calendar, if your setting needs that sort of
thing. You’ll want to be able to date events and talk about the
passage of time in concrete ways.
Next, what do the players need for character creation? In
D&D, for example, this includes the gods (because clerics need to
pick a deity) and languages (because everyone needs to pick those).
Do another one to two pages on that.
Finally, we’re going to aggressively zoom in and focus on the
local setting. Obviously, you’ll need to start by deciding where the
first adventure of the campaign is going to be set.
A major fantasy metropolis?

A village on the edge of civilization?
A lunar space station?
A lich-infested Rome?

Exactly what you’ll be prepping here will depend on the exact
nature of the setting, but once again your goal is one or two pages
of broad context that will give you a foundation for developing and
improvising as needed.
A few things that are often relevant:
Enough detail to describe local navigation. For a city, this might
be a breakdown of neighborhoods. For a village, it might be the
local roads (where do they go?) and terrain features (the Old
Forest, the Trollfens, etc.).

Who is politically in charge? That might be a local authority (e.g.,
the mayor) or a distant one (e.g., Tsarist border patrols
periodically pass through the region).
What are the local factions? These might be businesses, criminal
organizations, social organizations, ethnic groups, civic
institutions, etc.

Your goal here is not to be comprehensively encyclopedic. It’s
okay to say, “There’s a city council,” for example, without
specifying every individual councilor. Or to name one or two
councilors while leaving the rest as a tabula rasa for later
development.
Check to make sure that you’ve provided common resources that
the PCs will go looking for. In D&D, for example, that would
typically include:
the local store(s) where they’ll be able to buy supplies;
an inn or other place for them to stay; and

a tavern, as a default social destination and/or rumor distribution
center. (PCs just love going to taverns.)
A quick way to make your setting feel unique is to look at the
essential functions being provided here and, instead of using the
generic solution (general store, inn, tavern), come up with creative
and unusual solutions. For example:
There is a strange steampunk machine in the middle of the
village. Insert gems or precious metals and it will deliver, within
2d12 hours, the items you request.

The village doesn’t have an inn, but the PCs can find beds in the
abandoned—and very, very haunted—military barracks on Blood
Hill.

The locals socialize in a dreamhouse or nobhill, gathering at night
in their dreams while they sleep.

With these three parts in place—world summary, character
creation needs, and local setting—you’ll have your three to six pages
of prep. From this point forward, the setting will continue to
expand:
As the players create characters and you/they need to start
answering specific questions about where they’re from, etc.
You create your first adventure.
You create your second adventure.

And so on.
Of course, you can also just continue developing details of your
world wherever your whim and fancy take you. Worldbuilding for
its own sake is fun! And you can often discover things while delving
into the unexamined parts of your setting that can feed back into
your adventures in amazing, unexpected, and delightful ways.

MAPS

While working on your initial setting material, you may find it
useful to do some maps. To keep things brief, I have a couple tips
for this.
First, if you can get away with NOT doing a map, skip doing the
map for now.
Second, if you’re doing a map, keep it sketchy and try to keep it
at roughly the same level of detail as your minimal prep packet.
For example, when I did the first map for my Western Lands
campaign, I sketched a coastline, a couple mountain ranges, and the
borders of the Five Empires. I eventually added regional maps with
more details, but I was still using the original map with very few
additions more than 10 years later.
You need less than you think.

THE PLAYER PACKET

The other thing to note is that the three to six pages you’ve written
up can almost certainly, with perhaps just a teensy bit of editing,
double as the player’s briefing packet for the setting (see here).
It not only covers everything they need to know but is
conveniently almost the exact length (five pages) that I generally
find to be the maximum amount of extracurricular reading I can
rightfully hope that players might be willing to do before our first
session.
(Or, failing that, it’s short enough for them to parse it at the
table.)

PUTTING THE WORLD IN PLAY

You may have started this whole thing with an adventure in mind:
“I have an idea for a scenario where the PCs are mercenaries hired
by asteroid miners to protect their hab from space pirates … What
setting can I run this in?” Or maybe you just had a cool idea for a
world. Either way, it’s time to take this foundational material you’ve
developed and put a scenario in it.
There are obviously a whole bunch of different types of scenarios
you might choose to launch a campaign with. (See literally
everything else in this book.) No matter what the scenario is,
though, it’s virtually certain it will add more detail to your setting:
A murder investigation involving the Hephaestus Corporation will
add details about Hephaestus to your faction notes.
A dungeon scenario set in the ruins of the dwarven city of
Khunbaral will add details about dwarven culture and the history
of the great dwarven kingdoms of the east.
A heist targeting Solarian blood diamonds may add details about
the asteroid mining guilds and the Lytekkas Hypercorp.

Which is great! As you actually run these scenarios, you’ll also
want to keep track of stuff that develops through actual play. (It’s a
rare session when you don’t discover something new about a

character or need to create a whole new location on demand.) A lot
of this information will only be relevant to the specific scenario, but
there’ll also be stuff that you’ll want to add to your general notes on
the world. If you take the time to do that, it’ll make it a lot easier
for you to use these details in future scenarios (when the PCs decide
to target Hephaestus for a heist or get hired by Lytekkas, for
example).
Of course, the amount of setting material you’ll need to prep for
your initial scenario (and later scenarios) can vary quite a bit. If
you’re setting up a hexcrawl (see here) for an open table campaign
(see here), for example, then you’ll be prepping A LOT more setting
material before the first session. If it’s a simple 5 + 5 Dungeon (see
here), then you might be adding very little.
Either way, you’ll have taken your first steps into a brand-new
world.
Your world.

RUMOR TABLES
For an exploration-based campaign like a megadungeon or hexcrawl
to come to life, the players need to be able to learn information
about the region of exploration so that they can
set specific goals,

ask specific questions, and

plan their expeditions (see here).
This is the function of the rumor table, which in its most simple
form is simply a random table: Roll a die and tell the players a

rumor. This gives a default baseline for delivering a basic
foundation of lore, with each rumor providing a tangible nugget of
information.
d

RUMOR

1

In the ruins northwest of Maernath, there is said to be a large
cache of silver coins.

2

Orc raiders have been attacking caravans along the King’s
Road.

3 In the depths of Silverwood, there is a tree with the corpse of a
vampire staked to it.
4

A dryad’s tree can be found along the Mitari River in the
Gloomboughs.

5

Flying carpets have been seen in the skies around the volcano
west of town.

6

In Silverwood there’s a circle of stone sarsens. Stand among
them and blow on a horn of mistletoe and you can open a fairy
gate.

7

A group of recently executed smugglers supposedly hid their
treasures in a cave in the Skullsplitter Hills.

8

The lizardmen of the Graymires are said to treat minotaurs as
if they were gods.

9 If you go to the Fungal Forest, it’s important to avoid the spore
clouds there.
10

On the eastern edge of the northern mountains, an ancient
castle stands on the side of a peak. It is surrounded by a dome
of red energy through which nothing living can pass.

You can see how the rumors on this table would instruct PCs in a
hexcrawl campaign about local regions (Silverwood, Gloomboughs,

Skullsplitter Hills, Graymires, Fungal Forest) and interesting
adventuring sites (northwest ruins, smuggler caves, the crimson
castle) that they can now consciously choose to seek out or use as
navigational markers rather than just stumbling around randomly.
If this information is so useful, why not just give it to them all at
once? Partly this comes down to effective pacing. In an explorationbased campaign, you really want the players to be discovering
things over time. This also avoids information overload: By
spreading the information out over time, it becomes easier for the
players to process it and use it. (It’s the same reason you don’t read
a textbook cover to cover but instead process each section of the
textbook and then apply it through practice problems, classroom
discussion, and the like before proceeding to the next section.)
Conversely, if you only want to give the PCs a few rumors at a
time, why go to the trouble of stocking an entire rumor table? Why
not just design the handful of bespoke rumors that you’re going to
give them? Well, as we’ll see, a good rumor table is an incredibly
useful tool for you, as the GM, to have at the table, allowing you to
respond to any number of actions that might be taken by the PCs.

STOCKING THE RUMOR TABLE

Stocking a rumor table is pretty straightforward: Figure out what
size die you want to roll, list that number of rumors, and number
them. (Or, vice versa, make a list of rumors until you run out of
ideas or feel like you have enough of them, then count them and
assign whatever die size seems most appropriate.)
But how many rumors should you aim to have in your hexcrawl
or megadungeon?
There’s no one true answer here. Personally, I like to have 20. A
d20 is convenient, and it gives you enough rumors to cover the
breadth of the hexcrawl without going overboard. (If you own a
d30, this can also be a fun way to use that unusual die. But a table
of d100 rumors, in my experience, can be a lot of work to prep
without really providing anything of extra value.)

In making each rumor, you’re going to be looking at its source
and focus.
RUMOR SOURCE
The source for a rumor in a dungeon is likely to be a room or level.
In a hexcrawl, things can get a little more varied, including any of
the following:
hexes

random encounter tables
roads/paths/trails
factions
NPCs

Basically, anything you’ve keyed or created for the hexcrawl can
(and arguably should!) be fodder for your rumor table.
KEY FROM THE HEX
If I start struggling to come up with new rumors to stock my
hexcrawl rumor table with, a technique I’ve found useful is to just
pick a random hex, look at what I’ve keyed there, and then figure
out a rumor that could lead the PCs to it. (If you’ve done a 10 x 10
hexmap, for instance, you can just roll two d10s, cross-reference
their position, and look at the resulting hex.)
If you’re feeling confident in your improv skills, you can use this
same technique to generate random rumors during actual play even
if you don’t have a prepared rumor table.

RUMOR FOCUS
Potential focuses for rumors can include any or all of the following:
Location

Creature
Object

Actions/Situations (including threats and upcoming situations)
Background/Lore

For example, let’s consider this simple example hex:

C2-WYVERN SHAFT

A 60-foot-deep shaft that serves as the lair of a wyvern. The wyvern
has dug an escape tunnel that emerges from a hill a quarter mile
away.
WYVERN
Has a large scar on its left side from a spear wound.
TREASURE
7,000 sp, 5 zircons (50 gp each)
What rumors could we generate from this?
Location: Adventurers exploring the Red Plateau southwest of
town report seeing a mysterious 60-foot-deep shaft.

Creature: A wyvern has been seen flying over the Red Plateau.

Object: A wyvern attacked a tax assessor’s wagon along the
Southway and carried off a lockbox containing 7,000 sp. It was
last seen flying east.
Situation: A wyvern has been attacking travelers along the
Southway.

Lore: A generation ago, wyvern eggs were taken from the Red
Plateau and sent east so that the hatchlings could imprint on

imperial wyvern riders. The practice ended because the plateau
became depopulated as a result of the egg-harvesting.
Note that, regardless of the rumor’s focus, each rumor is
actionable, in the sense that it gives a clear location for the PCs to
go to. The primary function of the rumor table is to guide and
inform the PCs’ explorations, and it can’t do that if the PCs lack the
information necessary to do anything with the rumor. (For example,
a rumor that just said “there’s a wyvern in the area” is, at best, very
limited in its utility, because there’s no way for the PCs to go
looking for the wyvern other than just wandering around
randomly.)
The actionable specificity of a rumor can vary quite a bit, though.
“East of the Southway” is less precise than “check out the Red
Plateau,” which is less precise than “the adventurers sell you a map
indicating the precise location of the shaft for 10 gold pieces.” But
even the vaguest of these provides some specific direction.

HEARING RUMORS

With a fully stocked rumor table ready to go, it’s time to deliver
your rumor to the PCs. Broadly speaking, there are three approaches
for doing this: proactive, reactive, and opportunistic.
Proactive methods sort of “push” rumors on the PCs without the
players taking any specific action to acquire them.
Interval Trigger: At some regular interval, the PCs pick up new
rumors. This might be once per week, at the end of each
adventure, once per downtime, or any such trigger.

Action/Location Triggers: You might also trigger rumor delivery
based on actions the PCs take that are not, explicitly, looking for
rumors. For example, they might get new rumors each time they
return to town or visit a new town.
Character Creation: It’s a very good idea to give any brand-new
character one or more rumors to kick things off. Before play even

begins, these rumors will give players the knowledge to start
setting goals and making navigational decisions.

Rumor Check: At any point where you could have a proactive
rumor trigger, you could make a rumor check instead of
automatically granting rumors. You’ll also want to decide if it’s
possible to gain multiple rumors at the same time, and whether
rumors are gained individually or by the whole group.
For example, in my last open table (see here) hexcrawl campaign,
every new character would get 1d4 rumors (the stuff they’d heard
before the player started playing them) and I would make a 1 in 6
rumor check for each PC at the beginning of each session
(representing stuff they’d heard around town since the last time
we’d seen them in play).
ROLL FOR RUMORS!
No matter how they actually get the rumor, you can have the
players roll for their rumor! It is a fun way for them to feel involved
in the process and can increase their sense of “ownership” over the
rumor they get.
As players learn how useful rumors can be, they’re likely to start
actively seeking them out. They may also go looking for other types
of information without necessarily thinking in terms of “rumors,”
but that nevertheless can feed rumors to them. You can be reactive
to these PC actions:
Investigation Action: The investigation action is part of the
urbancrawl scenario structure (see here), but this covers any
effort by the PCs to deliberately canvass a community for
information. This effort might require a Charisma (Investigation)
or similar check, with the number of rumors gleaned perhaps
being determined by the relative success of the check.

Tavern Talk: Buying a round of drinks and plying others over a
cup of grog in the common room of a tavern is another common
shorthand for gathering rumors.

Broadsheets and Bulletin Boards: Broadsheets (the antecedents
of newspapers) and bulletin board notices are formal packaging
for rumors, allowing the PCs to periodically check in and receive
a fresh packet of information. (You can imagine any number of
similar packages, ranging from town criers to magic mirrors
murmuring cryptic prophecies.) The content of each package
(broadsheet headlines, job offers on the bulletin board, etc.) can
be bespoke creations, or it’s just as easy to roll them up randomly
from your rumor table.
Research: Delving into tomes at the local library or digging
through the musty scrolls of the official chronicles may not turn
up rumors dealing with purely current events, but there are any
number of rumors that can nevertheless be delivered through PC
research (e.g., the trade in wyvern eggs a generation back).
Regardless of the precise method pursued by the PCs, you might
consider adding a cost (for buying a round of drinks, well-placed
bribes, access fees at the university library, etc.). I’d recommend
against making this a particularly large fee, since obviously you
don’t want to discourage players from pursuing rumors. Something
like 1d6 gp in D&D is quite reasonable.
Another option is to make the fee optional, but have it grant a
bonus to the PCs’ skill check (making success more likely or
improving the quality or number of rumors gained). In this case,
since it’s not essential, you can elect to make the cost more
substantial.
ADD RUMOR COST TO THE EQUIPMENT LIST!
Once a cost, optional or otherwise, has been attached to rumor
gathering, one cool thing you can do is add this cost to the
equipment list for your campaign. Now every player rolling up a

new character and every returning character looking to resupply for
their next expedition will have an in-their-face reminder that
hunting for rumors is something they can do!
Of course, because the whole point of the rumor table is to impart
information to the players, you should also seize opportunities
during play that you can use to leverage your rumor table. For
example:
During any broad social interaction (e.g., the players say, “We
spend the evening drinking at the tavern”), you might mention
one or two interesting things they pick up in the general
conversation.

During interactions with specific NPCs, the rumor table can be
used to generate topics of conversation. (“Did you hear about the
wyvern sightings?”)
NPCs could also be deliberately questioned or interrogated about
the area.

In practice, the rumor table is an incredibly versatile tool, and
whenever a dollop of information would be useful or provide a bit
of spice, you can simply roll or select an appropriate rumor for the
situation.
CONTEXTUALIZING RUMORS
When giving a rumor to a player, you can simply drop it in their
lap: “You’ve heard that a wyvern has been attacking travelers along
the Southway.” It works. There’s nothing wrong with it. In fact, it
may often be the best way to present that particular rumor. (For
example, if you’re handing out a bunch of rumors at one time—e.g.,
at character creation—there’s no need to get fancy with it.)
Frequently, though, you’ll find it more effective to contextualize
the rumor—to explain exactly how the PCs came by the information
and perhaps even give them an opportunity to play through it. This
is when you frame up a scene at the local tavern where the PCs have

noticed a young man with a freshly bandaged wound on his
shoulder. Now they can strike up a conversation with him, learn his
name, and hear from his own lips the tale of how the wyvern
attacked his caravan and carried away his sister. They can see the
haunted look in his eyes as he describes how her screams still echo
in his ears.
Now those wyvern attacks have been given a face.
There are many ways, of course, that you can contextualize
rumors. Here are a few options if you’re struggling:
Talking in a tavern. (Is it a quiet conversation? Or do they hear
someone boisterously boasting at the next table?)
Saw the information posted somewhere (a wanted poster, a
bulletin board, etc.).

Chatting with a friend. (Which friend? Ask the player if you don’t

REPEATING & RESTOCKING RUMORS

When you give a rumor to the PCs, cross it off the rumor list. If you
roll the same rumor again, you may want to reroll until you get a
new rumor, but another option is to make a point of finding a
different spin or variation on the information the PCs already have.
(For example, if they’ve previously heard that a wyvern has been
attacking travelers along the Southway, they might hear about a
different group of travelers being attacked. Or maybe the wyvern
has expanded its range and is attacking people near the logging
camps. Or maybe there’s a group of adventurers who saw it flying
over the Red Plateau.)
As rumors get chewed up, though, you’ll eventually want to
restock the rumor table. Simply repeat the same process you used to

create the rumor table originally, but also keep in mind current
events and evolving situations (e.g., the wyvern expanding its range
or stealing something valuable to add to its hoard).
A particularly effective technique is to reflect the PCs’ actions in
the rumor table. PCs tend to do lots of big, splashy stuff (like killing
wyverns) that are exactly the sort of thing people gossip about. So
when they do something notable, add it—or the situations that
evolve out of it—to the rumor table.
Players love this. (“Hey! That was us!”) It makes them feel
important and it’s a great way of showing that their choices are
meaningful and their actions have consequences. The possibilities
are almost limitless:
With the wyvern slain, trade along the Southway has boomed.
The caravan activity has outstripped the capacity of the Patrol
Guild and they’re looking for freelance guards willing to ride with
the smaller caravans.
Lord Erequad has issued a bounty for the adventurers who are
believed to have stolen the tax assessor’s lockbox (which was
originally taken by the wyvern).

Four hungry baby wyverns have been seen hunting on the Red
Plateau.
In a great campaign, the adventure never ends and the rumor
table is constantly driving the world forward.

RUNNING COMBAT

Most roleplaying games include a very specific procedure for
running combat. You usually can’t go too far wrong just following
that procedure. If the game doesn’t include a cheat sheet, though,
you might want to prep one—summarizing the combat sequence
and the combat actions each character can take—to keep you on the
right track.
This extra credit is all about taking your combat to the next level
—not just running it, but excelling at it. We’ll start with a core set of
best practices and then expand with a selection of tips and tricks.
I don’t recommend trying to put all of this material into practice
at the same time. Instead, just pick one or two things and really
focus on incorporating them into your sessions. Once you feel like
you’ve really mastered those techniques, grab another one to focus
on. Add tools to your tool kit over time.
What I’ll do is write the thing I’m working to improve onto a Postit® note and attach it to my GM screen. That way the reminder to
focus on combat descriptions or putting players on deck (or
whatever it might be) is always in my peripheral vision. I call these
practice points, and they really help me make sure I’m not losing
track of that stuff during the hectic chaos of the game.

BEST PRACTICES FOR COMBAT

Before combat even begins, set yourself up for success by prepping a
combat cheat sheet for your group. This is just a list of the PCs
along with key information like
armor class (AC),

spell save DC, and

Wisdom (Perception) modifier.
You don’t want to have to track the full character sheet of every
PC (you’ve got too many other things to worry about), but stuff like
this is the absolute death knell for fast-paced, action-packed combat:
GM: The orc attacks you! What’s your AC?

MALIKWA (ELWYNN): 18.
GM: (rolls some dice) The orc hits! They do 6 bludgeoning
damage. Frank, what’s Reinhart’s AC?
FRANK (REINHART): 15.
GM: (rolls some dice) The other orc hits you! 5 damage.
As opposed to:
GM: One of the orcs attacks Elwynn and the other Reinhart. (rolls
some dice) You’re both driven back half a step under their
bludgeoning blows. Elwynn takes 6 damage and Reinhart 5.
Reinhart, what are you doing?
Particularly when you consider that this is happening over and
over and over again. So much more focus and flow can be achieved
if you just jot down the numbers you’re constantly needing to
reference. It’s also a great idea to put this info on a Post-it note and
attach it to your GM screen, so that you always know exactly where
it is.
Unfortunately, this doesn’t work well if a PC has an ability that is
constantly changing their AC (or other target number). In D&D this
is comparatively rare and you can usually just suck it up for that
specific character, but these target numbers can be much more fluid
in other RPGs. An alternative you can use here is to give each player
a tent card: They can put their character name and the key target
numbers on the tent card. If the player takes an action that changes
their AC, it’s their responsibility to update their tent card. (You can
even buy whiteboard tent cards that can be easily updated.)
On the other side of the battlefield, you can also prep combat
stat sheets for your bad guys. If I’m running an RPG with
minimalist stat blocks, I will frequently be able to fit all of the stat
blocks for an entire adventure on one page. (Which is, of course,
fantastic.) For games like D&D with more elaborate stat blocks, I’ll
try to make sure all the bad guys in a specific scene or, alternatively,
each action group from my adversary roster (see here) are grouped
onto a single sheet.

What I want to be able to do is lay the stat sheet (or all the
relevant stat sheets) on the table in front of me. That way I don’t
have to go flipping through books looking for stats; I can just flick
my eyes from one piece of information to another.
THE GM’S TV TRAY
Whether I’m running at a table or from my computer, I find it super
useful to put a TV tray next to my chair. Sometimes I’ll use two! It
gives me a dedicated space for my rulebooks, adventure notes,
campaign status document (see here), miniatures, and the like. Only
the material that is immediately relevant to the scene I’m currently
running goes on the table in front of me, making everything easier to
manage and reference.
Continuing the theme of keeping good notes, once combat starts,
write down the initiative order. You can do this on a piece of
paper, you can use a digital tool to keep track of it, you can put
each combatant on a separate note card and flip through the stack,
you can write it on a whiteboard, you can erect an initiative tower,
or you can drop small tent cards in order across the top of your GM
screen. Whatever works for you. Just never, ever be this guy:
GM: Does anyone go on 18? … No? Okay, what about 17? 16?
15?
MALIKWA (ELWYNN): I go on 15!
When one combatant wraps up their turn, you should know
whose turn is next and go straight to them. Keep combat moving!
As you’re running combat, even though the rules are likely
making everything a little more formal, remember that you’re still
just making rulings. Don’t forget your basic principles: Default to
yes. Roll to find out. Have meaningful failures. And so forth.
This includes narrating outcomes. In the constant back-and-forth
of combat, it can be easy to fall into a rote exchange featuring only

the bare-bones mechanics:
GM: The orc hits you. 6 points of damage.
MALIKWA (ELWYNN): I attack the orc. (rolls some dice) I hit for 3
damage.
GM: Okay, the ogre is attacking now, too. He misses. Reinhart?
FRANK (REINHART): I hit the orc. (rolls some dice) 8 damage.
GM: The orc dies.
The mechanics reflect, model, and even prompt the game world,
but it’s ultimately your responsibility to bring that world to life.
GM: The orc slams Elwynn back into the wall. Take 6 points of
damage.
MALIKWA (ELWYNN): I’ll shove him off me and swing my
sword. (rolls some dice) I hit for 3 damage.
GM: The orc takes a nasty cut to his arm. Green blood trickles
onto the floor as he backs away cautiously. (rolls some dice) You
take a step after him, but then leap back as the ogre’s club
crashes down between you! Reinhart?
FRANK (REINHART): I’ll attack the orc. (rolls some dice) 8
damage.
GM: Penned in by Elwynn and the ogre, the orc can’t scurry away
fast enough. Your sword pierces through its belly, pinning it to
the wall. It squirms haplessly on your blade and dies.
By setting the tone, you’ll also be encouraging the players to get
more descriptive and creative in their actions. Failing that, you can
prompt them by asking, “What does that look like?” (E.g., “You’ve
killed the orc. What does that look like?”)
Providing awesome combat narration is tough, though. Even
keeping in mind that less is usually more (you only need one or two
small details to bring the scene to life, not a short story), the
constant stream of action is very demanding, particularly since so

much of the action is fundamentally repetitive. (How many different
ways can you describe Reinhart hitting something with his sword?!)
Fortunately, the more you practice combat narration, the better
you’ll become. (It’s a skill, just like any other.) In fact, you can even
practice this away from the gaming table. An exercise I’ve found to
be effective is to watch an action movie that you love while
describing the action on-screen as if you were narrating a game
session. You might feel a little silly, but this will build your
repertoire of fight moves and challenge you to find ways to describe
new types of action.
If you’re still getting ready to run your first few sessions, pause
here and take some time to get comfortable with this basic
foundation. Then you can start layering in the advanced tips that
follow when the time is right.

ROLL INITIATIVE LAST

D&D and many other RPGs you play will tell you that:
1. Combat starts.
2. You roll initiative.
But this often doesn’t produce optimal results.
What I recommend is that you have your players roll their
initiative at the end of combat. Write those numbers down and then
use them for the next combat. When it looks like the PCs are about
to encounter something, you should also roll for its initiative and
slot it into the initiative order before combat actually breaks out.
Using this technique, by the time combat starts, initiative is
already completely resolved, so there’s no delay where you have to
ask for initiative, the dice are rolled, your players tell you the
results, then you sort those results in order … etc.
By having initiative ready to go, you can start combat off with a
bang and keep the ball rolling with that same high intensity. It
means that when the players are ambushed, you can maintain that

adrenaline rush instead of immediately undermining it with the
mundane task of collecting initiative. Instead of “Eight goblins drop
out of the jungle canopy! … Let’s wait three minutes while we all
shuffle numbers around,” it’s “Eight goblins drop out of the jungle
canopy! Reinhart! What do you do?!”
Rolling initiative at the end of combat is convenient because
that’s typically a time when other bookkeeping chores are being
done anyway: After the heat of battle, wounds are being healed,
corpses are being looted, equipment lists are being updated, and
options are being discussed. Juggling a few extra numbers doesn’t
detract or even really distract from that. It just becomes part of the
ambient noise.
You can also achieve a similar effect by setting up a digital tool
that lets you generate an initiative order by pushing a single button.
(Technology is fabulous!) But here, too, I recommend anticipating
the moment a bit: You really want to be able to flow directly from
the moment hostilities break out into the fast and furious action
with zero distractions.

PUT THE PLAYERS ON DECK

To keep the action flowing once you’re in the thick of combat, put
your players on deck.
As I mentioned above, there are lots of ways to track the initiative
order. Some of these methods will allow the players to see the
initiative order at all times (whiteboards, initiative towers, and so
forth), while others won’t. But in either case, make a habit of
periodically saying, “Okay, the goblins are going to attack now, and
then Malikwa you’re on deck.”
This will get annoying if you do it every single time, but with
practice you’ll find the moments when you should do it by watching
for when the attention of the players has wavered, and it will speed
up combat by making sure players are ready to go when their turn
arrives.

The even more advanced version of this tip is multitasking.
While Malikwa is deciding what Elwynn is going to do or, later, as
she’s making her attack roll against the goblins, you can look ahead
and see that the hell hound is going next. If Elwynn is on the other
side of the battlefield—or otherwise unlikely to affect what the hell
hound is going to do—you’re free to decide that it’s going to attack
Reinhart and make its attack roll. Now, when Elwynn’s turn ends,
the hell hound’s action has already been resolved and you can
simply declare what happens!
With practice, you can sometimes get the players to multitask,
too. It’s a little trickier and not every player is comfortable doing it,
but if, say, Reinhart was going immediately after Elwynn in the
initiative order and was, similarly, on the opposite side of the
battlefield, there’s no reason he couldn’t start resolving his attack
against the hell hound.
(If Reinhart is planning something that could interfere with what
Elywnn is doing, or vice versa, it’s obviously also fine to just say,
“I’m going to wait until she’s done.”)

THE FISTFUL OF DICE

Another way to speed up combat resolution is rolling lots of dice at
the same time.
You can start simple: Instead of making your attack roll, checking
to see if you hit, and then rolling your damage, simply roll your
attack and damage at the same time. If you hit, the damage is ready
to go. If you don’t, just ignore the damage die.
You can, once again, suggest that your players do the same. Some
players won’t like it, for any number of reasons, and that’s just fine.
Back on your side of the screen, when you’re dealing with an
entire squad of bad guys, you can make all their attack rolls at the
same time. For example, if I’ve got six goblins all attacking on the
same initiative count, I’ll roll 6d20 and then resolve the goblins in
order from left to right as the dice fall. (I usually don’t combine this

with simultaneously rolling damage dice. I know it’s sacrilege to
suggest it, but there is such a thing as too many dice.)

SHARE TARGET NUMBERS

Remember how you’re writing down the PCs’ target numbers so that
you don’t have to keep asking for them during play?
You can do the same thing for the players by sharing your
monsters’ ACs and saving throw DCs!
If it’s convenient, you might actually write these down for them.
(If the initiative tracker is visible, perhaps you could jot it down
next to their initiative entry.) But even just telling Reinhart, who’s
currently fighting the hell hound, what the hell hound’s AC is can
have much of the same effect. (If Reinhart’s player is forgetful,
perhaps suggest that they write it down on some scratch paper.)
Now, there are many situations in which it may feel more
appropriate for the players to not know the bad guy’s specific AC or
saving throw DC or whatever. If that’s the case? Don’t share it!
But frequently that’s not the case: Reinhart, the seasoned combat
veteran, should have a pretty good idea how difficult it is to hit
guards wearing plate armor. Plus, after a round or so the players
will probably be able to reverse engineer the numbers anyway, so
you might as well openly declare them and reap the benefits of
saved time.

DESCRIBE YOUR TOKEN PLAY

If you’re playing with a battlemap—whether physically on a table or
virtually on a screen—a bad habit you can fall into is to move your
miniatures (or tokens or standees or whatever) and then describe
what happened. (Or not describe it at all. Or describe it and then
move.) What you should try to do is move the miniature and
describe the action at the same time.
And, specifically, try to describe the action in terms of the game
world. Not, “I’ll move over here” but “The goblin scurries past the
brontosaurus.”

You should also do this when you’re setting up your miniatures!
(Or peeling back the fog of war in your VTT.)
GM: (starts sketching the scene on the battlemap) Suddenly you hear
the mournful baying of wolves and the battle horns of orcs.
Reinhart, what are you doing?
FRANK (REINHART): I’ll draw my sword and move in front of
the spellcasters!
GM: (places Reinhart’s miniature and continues sketching) What
about Elwynn?
MALIKWA (ELWYNN): I’ll activate my ring of invisibility.
GM: (as she places miniatures) Over the top of the ridge, a dozen
worg riders suddenly surge into view! Reinhart, it’s back to you.
(continues placing miniatures as Reinhart declares his next action,
then continues smoothly into action resolution)
The point, of course, is that you’re not putting the action on
pause. In fact, this can turn the placement of the miniatures into a
dramatic moment in its own right. “How many worgs are there?”
the players whisper. Or, later, you reach down into a drawer and
declare, “Suddenly, out of the black abyss, a black dragon emerges!”
as you pull the miniature out, swoop it across the table, and drop it
onto the battlemap.
USE GENERIC PROXIES
“I don’t have an umber hulk miniature, so we’re going to use
this ogre miniature instead.”
I understand the impulse, but I’ve found that for many players
the constant visual input of the proxy miniature will override
the description of the game world: No matter how many times
you say “umber hulk,” they will literally remember fighting an
ogre.

If you’ve got something that’s close (“We’re going to use goblin
miniatures for these orcs” or “We’re going to use this red
dragon for a black dragon”), you’re probably fine, but anything
further afield I think is a bad idea.
I’m not, of course, suggesting that you’re not allowed to use an
umber hulk in your game until you can afford the appropriate
miniature. That would be absurd. What I’m saying is that if
you’re using a battlemap and you don’t have the right
miniatures, you should use completely generic tokens.
I’ve found that for most creatures, colored glass beads (like the
ones often used for life tokens but that can usually be bought
much cheaper in a crafts shop), numbered tokens, or poker
chips work great. For larger creatures, I’ve got a stack of
templates I’ve cut from colored card stock and I’ll simply place
one of the generic tokens on top of it.
Similarly, when using a virtual tabletop, I’ll make sure to have
a set of generic tokens (usually numbered) that I can use when
needed. You don’t want to be limited to only the specific tokens
you have prepped, particularly if the PCs do something
unexpected in the middle of a session.

QUEUE ACTIONS FOR DESCRIPTION

Instead of describing each individual action as it’s resolved, you can
mechanically resolve several actions, group them together, and
weave them together into a single dynamic description.
GM: The orc hits you. 6 points of damage.
MALIKWA (ELWYNN): I attack the orc. (rolls some dice) I hit for 3
damage.
GM: Okay, the ogre is attacking now, too. He misses. Reinhart?
FRANK (REINHART): I hit the orc. (rolls some dice) 8 damage.

GM: As the ogre comes thundering in with his massive club raised
above his head, the orc lunges forward with his bloodstained
blade. Elwynn has no choice but to actually step forward into
the orc’s attack, twisting her body so that she only takes a
glancing blow. The ogre’s club smashes into the ground where
she was just standing, sending a plume of dust into the air. As
Elwynn propels herself forward, the orc falls back in a panic,
only to be caught between you and simultaneously skewered
from the front and back!
You don’t need to do this every time, but this technique can make
it a lot easier to keep the description of combat fresh and engaging.
We asked earlier, “How many different ways can you describe
Reinhart hitting something with his sword?” Well, the number
increases exponentially when his attacks can be woven into and
through the actions of others.
As you weave this action together, remember that combat turns
are an abstraction we use to make resolving combat easier and more
straightforward. They aren’t the reality of the characters’
experience. In that reality, the combatants aren’t all standing around
politely waiting to take their turn. Everything is happening at the
same time!

THE MOP-UP

We’ve reached the end of combat and the last bad guy is down to
the dregs of his hit points. One of the players makes an attack roll
… She hits!
And the GM says, “Don’t bother rolling damage! He’s dead!”
Don’t do this.
Before we delve into why this is a bad idea, let’s first talk about
why the impulse exists: The combat is clearly coming to a
conclusion and the remaining combatant poses no meaningful threat
to the PCs, so there’s no longer any tension or meaningful stakes in
the scene; it’s been reduced to a rote resolution. Heck! The bad guy

might only have one or two hit points left, so the outcome really is
predetermined, so why bother rolling damage dice?
This is pointless! Let’s wrap it up!
The impulse is not necessarily wrong. It’s just mistimed.
The key thing here is the ownership of the win. When a player
rolls a successful attack, deals damage, and the bad guy dies, that’s
something that THEY did. They own that moment.
If you, as the GM, interrupt that process and declare a fiat success,
you take that moment away from them: They didn’t kill the
monster; you did.
It’s a subtle distinction, and it won’t always result in the moment
getting deflated, but it’ll deflate often enough that it’s worth
steering clear of this technique. Particularly since the benefit you’re
getting is so minor: You’re saving … what? 15 seconds by having
them skip the damage roll?
The obvious alternative is to just let them roll damage and then
announce the result.
That works if the damage kills the bad guy. But what if the attack
doesn’t quite deal enough damage to finish the job? This fight is
boring! It’s time to be done with it!
First, double-check to make sure that’s actually true. As the GM,
the fight has become boring because you can see the numbers and
the outcome has become certain. In roleplaying the bad guys, you’ve
lost meaningful agency and that’s boring. But your experience here
may not mirror the players’, they haven’t lost agency. In fact,
they’re about to reap the rewards of their agency! They’re going to
win! Winning is exciting!
If it is time for the fight to be done, however, you can fudge the
bad guy’s hit points. After the PC deals damage, the bad guy still
has 2 hit points left. You can just round that down to 0 and call it a
day. (Fudging the results of a roll is usually a really bad idea, but
it’s probably fine here. You’re not actually changing the ultimate
outcome, which is where all the various problems with fudging
come from. You’re just speeding it up.)

Alternatively, you can do the exact opposite: If the combat is
lagging and you’re concerned the current PC’s attack may not deal
enough damage to end it if they roll poorly on the damage dice, tell
them how many hit points the monster has left before they roll.
This obviously blocks you completely from using the fudging
technique.
The reason this works, however, is that knowing the damage
needed puts the table’s intense focus on the damage roll: Everyone
knows exactly what needs to be rolled, the tension builds as the dice
are picked up, and then explosively releases—whether in triumph or
failure!—as the result is revealed. If the bad guy dies: Great! You’ve
injected that moment with a little extra oomph. If they don’t? Great!
You’ve still clearly framed this as the final countdown and that
focus will tend to carry forward to the next PC’s attack.
Taking a step back, we might also ask ourselves how we got to
this specific moment: How could we have avoided getting to the
point where a combat encounter is ending in a whimper?
The obvious answer is to end combat sooner.
There are several ways to do this, but the easiest is to simply have
the bad guys run away. The PCs take out the Bandit Queen and
that’s the sign for all of her mooks to hightail it! Or, alternatively,
the PCs take out a bunch of mooks and the Bandit Queen decides
discretion is the better part of valor.
(Also check out The Principles of RPG Villainy, on page 515, for a
lengthier discussion of how and why having your bad guys run
away is a good idea in any case.)
It’s really important, though, to make sure that there’s actually
been a conclusion! And that the players can feel ownership of that
conclusion! The example of the PCs taking out the Bandit Queen
and then the mooks panicking works because the combat ending is a
clear result of the PCs doing something decisive and significant.
(Fortunately, having the bad guys run away is a decision that
player agency can persist through. So you’ve got a wide margin for
error here.)

As you’re trying to find the sweet spot here, it can be useful to
understand some of the problems that arise when GMs end combat
prematurely:
Characters built to enjoy their spotlight time during combat
are being punished.

Strategically clever players often spend the first few rounds of
combat setting up an advantageous situation, and it’s frustrating
if that gets prematurely negated.

If players feel that encounters are being summarily dismissed in a
way that isn’t affected by their agency, their uncertainty about
which encounters are actually being determined by their actions
and which are being determined by GM fiat will make it difficult
for them to determine when and how to spend limited resources.
(Burning a one-use potion or once-per-day ability only to have its
use become irrelevant because the GM got bored is incredibly
frustrating. If the use of that ability is what effectively ended the
threat of the combat, make sure you’re emphasizing that in
framing the end of the scene so that the player’s agency is given
its due.)
It can help to remind yourself that you should be the PCs’ biggest
fan: Them trouncing your bad guys should, paradoxically, fill you
with as much joy as it does the players! When that’s true, you’ll be
on the same page as the players and it’ll get a lot easier to
accurately judge how a scene is playing out (and how it needs to
end).
To wrap up with the big takeaway here: Make sure the players
feel ownership over what happens: that they were the ones to win
the fight. As long as that remains true, everything else will work
out.

SCENARIO HOOKS
Scenario hooks are the methods by which PCs become aware that a
scenario exists, are enticed to engage the scenario, and/or are forced
to engage the scenario.
Let’s say that you have a scenario featuring a pack of werewolves
that have taken up residence in a ruined castle a few miles away
from a small village. What scenario hook could you use to get the
PCs involved in this scenario?
Perhaps:
The villagers could ask them for help, or a local burgher could
offer to pay them to root out the werewolves. (This is an example
of patronage; an NPC is requesting that something specific be
done.)

They could hear rumors in the local tavern about the spate of
recent werewolf attacks, or see bounty notices posted by the local
sheriff. (This is an example of an offer; the GM is simply offering
information and it’s up to the PCs to determine what they want to
do with that information, if anything.)
As they ride past the ruined castle, a couple of the werewolves
come racing out to attack them, or they hear screams of terror
emanating from a farmhouse. (This is a confrontation; the
scenario is directly encountered by the PCs.)

In each case, the PCs generally come away with a basic
understanding of the situation and an understanding of what action
they’re expected to take: There are werewolves in the ruined castle
and they need to get rid of them. (With some hooks they might only
know that there are werewolves in the area and need to do some
investigation to identify the ruined castle as their den, but that
would still involve a general understanding of the situation. It’s also

possible, of course, for the PCs to choose a course of action that
doesn’t involve getting rid of the werewolves, but when you design
a scenario with slavering werewolves who are killing innocent
people, it’s fairly clear what the expected decision will be.)
In order for a scenario hook to work, it must be actionable. In
other words, there has to be an identifiable vector that will allow
the PCs to engage with the scenario—to explore its locations,
interact with its characters, and so forth. It doesn’t matter how
much tantalizing information you give the PCs about the Lost City
of Shandrala; if they have no way of finding the city, then it’s not a
scenario hook. It’s just backdrop and foreshadowing.

MULTIPLE SCENARIO HOOKS

If you think in terms of quest-givers in video games or the plot hook
of a typical film or book (or even the example given by many
published RPG scenarios), it can be easy to think that each scenario
in your campaign should have a single, distinct scenario hook. As
our example with the werewolf den demonstrates, however, it’s
quite easy for a single scenario to have multiple scenario hooks
connected to it. In fact, I would argue that virtually every scenario
should have multiple scenario hooks.
First, this follows principles similar to the Three Clue Rule (see
here). In fact, if you’re using a node-based campaign structure (see
here), it’s literally the Three Clue Rule. By including multiple
scenario hooks for each scenario, you make it much more likely that
the PCs will be enticed by one of the hooks and engage with the
scenario.
Second, each additional hook provides a unique angle—of
opportunity, of knowledge, of responsibility—on the scenario. Like a
multifaceted gem, these angles enrich a scenario, increasing its
depth and variety.
Third, multiple hooks can be set in direct conflict with each other.
These are referred to as dilemma hooks, and their contradictions
inherently empower the players by forcing them to make

meaningful choices about what they’re doing and why they’re doing
it.
One of my favorite techniques for setting up a dilemma hook is to
use opposing patrons: If Patron A asks them to murder the CEO of
Abletek and Patron B asks them to work as the CEO’s security detail
during an upcoming business conference, the players immediately
need to really think about the scenario they’re being hooked into:
What do they want to have happen to the CEO? They can’t just do
what they’re told. They’re going to have to decide what they think
should be done.
The really cool thing is that once this empowers the players—
once they understand that they’re the ones in control of how the
scenario will play out—they’ll often end up deciding they want
something completely different from either patron. They’ll set their
own agenda and take the game to places none of you could have
imagined before play began.
Simply having multiple hooks can also result in dilemmas
emerging during play, even if they weren’t designed with that in
mind. (“Do we chase after the assassin to claim the bounty or do we
save the Jewel of Erthasard from the river of lava?”) If you’ve got
multiple goals, it’s not unusual for circumstance to put those goals
in conflict with each other.
The only real drawback to having multiple scenario hooks is that
you have to create them. But in truth, this is no hardship. Once you
have a fully developed scenario, it’s easy to hang scenario hooks off
it. In fact, as an RPG producer, I tell my writers to design the
scenario hooks last, even though it’s the first thing the players will
experience: It’s infinitely easier to hang a hook when you already
have something to hang it on, and it almost always results in
stronger and more compelling hooks.
As a final note, you ideally want each scenario hook to be
distinct: They should come from different sources, include different
(although probably overlapping) information, and be driven by
different motives. (It’s less interesting for three different villagers to
all follow the same basic script in asking the PCs to help get rid of

the werewolves. It’s more interesting if they see werewolf tracks in
the forest and then a villager asks them for help and then they spot
a poster offering to pay a bounty on werewolf pelts.)

TWISTED SCENARIO HOOKS

A typical scenario hook will give the PCs a basic understanding of
the situation and an understanding of what action they’re supposed
to take, but this is not actually a necessary characteristic of a
scenario hook. Or, more accurately, it’s not necessary that their
understanding of the situation or the action they’re supposed to take
is correct. You can instead twist the scenario hook by misleading the
PCs about one or both of these things.
You might mislead them regarding the nature of the threat: The
villagers, discovering dismembered limbs and unfamiliar with
lycanthropic activity, think that the attacks signal a return of the
tribe of cannibalistic ogres who plagued the region a generation
ago. That’s what they tell the PCs, who will be unpleasantly
surprised—and perhaps wish they had stocked up on silver
weapons!—when they head out to the ruined castle and discover the
truth.
PLAYER-PROVIDED HOOKS
As you’re running a campaign, it’s not unusual for the players
to create their own scenarios. “I really want a lavender Ioun
stone,” they say, or, “I think it’s time to kill Sebastian.”
This, of course, is fantastic. All you need to do is find the right
scenario structure, fill in the blanks, add some challenges that
need to be overcome for them to achieve their intention, and
you’re good to go.
Such scenarios usually don’t need a scenario hook. (The PC is,
obviously, already invested and engaged. They’ve really created
their own scenario hook.) The exception is when their intention

isn’t actionable. For example, they want a lavender Ioun stone,
but have no idea where one might be.
When that happens, you’ll need to create an actionable vector.
That’s functionally a scenario hook and so it works like any
other scenario hook. One thing to note, though, is that
sometimes you can actually just add that scenario hook to an
existing scenario—e.g., it turns out the Ewing family owns a
lavender Ioun stone, so I guess that’s another reason to stage a
heist on their vault. Now you don’t even need to create a new
scenario!
You could also mislead them about the motives of the various
NPCs involved. For example, it turns out that the werewolves in the
ruined castle have actually come to the area to END the attacks by
hunting down their former packmate who’s suffering from silvered
rabies.
Or when the werewolves come rushing out of the castle toward
the PCs, it’s because they’ve just escaped from the hidden torture
dungeons of the local baron, who’s transforming innocent villagers
into werewolves to build a powerful, supernatural army. Reversing
good guys and bad guys like this is an extreme example, but an
instant classic.
When NPCs are involved in delivering the misleading scenario
hooks, it can be useful to distinguish between whether the NPCs are
deceiving the PCs or if it is, in fact, the NPCs being deceived (or
mistaken) about the situation: If the villagers know that the
werewolves are just peaceful nature lovers and they want the PCs to
eliminate them so that they can claim the werewolf clan’s ancestral
property in the valley, that’s a very different story from the villagers
honestly believing that the werewolves are guilty of horrible crimes.
The possibilities are basically endless, and can obviously vary a
lot depending on the actual details of the specific scenario.
The reason to use a twisted scenario hook is to create a reversal:
The players enter the scenario thinking that it’s one thing, but when

they discover the truth the entire scenario changes into something new.
In practice, delivering a strong reversal like this can turn even an
otherwise pedestrian scenario into a truly memorable one.
Twisted scenario hooks also work great when you’re using
multiple scenario hooks, particularly if they’re misleading in
interesting and different ways. It’s not only easier to vary the hooks;
it immediately creates a sense of mystery that will tantalize the
players and encourage them to engage with the scenario to figure
out what the heck is going on.

MEANINGFUL SCENARIO HOOKS

A mysterious cloaked figure in the corner of the tavern beckons the
PCs over. He wants to hire them to retrieve the Ruby of Kardalia
from a shipwreck near Stormhaven Cove!
This sort of scenario hook is fine, but it’s not really meaningful:
The PCs undoubtedly like money, but they’ve never met this guy
before and they’ve never heard of the Ruby of Kardalia before. You
could swap the nouns out and nothing would change.
Video games have normalized generic scenario hooks like this,
with NPCs sending you on countless quests to kill wild boars, collect
wolf gizzards, or deliver meaningless letters while you grind XP.
(The gizzards, in particular, seem zoologically suspect.)
You’ll also find generic scenario hooks in most published
adventures, for the simple reason that the authors of those
adventures don’t know your PCs, don’t know what’s happening in
your campaign, and have no way of making the scenario hooks
meaningful to you. But you do know your PCs and what’s been
happening in your campaign, so it can be quite trivial to do a lot
better than this.
Start by simply listening to your players and making it personal.
What do they already care about? People, places, things, goals.
Whatever it is, simply tie your hook to that and your work is
already done.

Instead of a mysterious stranger, what if it’s a family member or
longtime ally of the PCs?

Instead of the Ruby of Kardalia, what if it’s a magic item that one
of the PCs has been longing to get their hands on?
What if the shipwreck the stranger has identified is actually the
one that claimed the lives of a PC’s parents?

You can also increase the stakes. Put important stuff—including
people’s lives—on the line. “Hey, can you deliver this letter to my
wife?” is just a menial task. “You need to deliver this medicine or
my wife will die!” or “Deliver this letter to Stormhaven! They must
be warned of the Frostmancer’s return!” have a lot more meat on
their bones.

LONG-TERM SCENARIO HOOKS

On a similar note, video games and published scenarios have also
conditioned us to think of scenario hooks as bang-bang interactions:
The mysterious stranger wants to hire you, and so you immediately
leave to retrieve the Ruby. A dire wolf attacks you on the road, so
you immediately follow its tracks back to the pack’s warren.
Again, nothing wrong with a bang-bang hook. If you’re running a
campaign, though, you have the opportunity to do more than that,
by building up scenario hooks over the long term:
The Ruby of Kardalia was mentioned in that arcane text you
recovered from the Frostmancer’s tower.

The dire wolf attack isn’t just random; you’ve been hearing
reports of dire wolf attacks throughout the valley for months. In
fact, your sister was mauled and nearly killed by one last week.
Weaving the threads of your campaign together like this across
several adventures will make the whole experience feel more
cohesive, and it’ll naturally add extra layers of meaning to your
scenarios. In fact, making a scenario hook meaningful by making it

personal often has this same effect in reverse: Such a scenario is
emerging from the long-term interests and relationships that the PCs
have.
You can also foreshadow future scenarios by dropping
information that’s not actionable. For example, the PCs can spend
weeks hearing about dire wolf attacks without having any clear way
of responding to them, allowing information to build up over time.
(In some cases, the PCs could take action but don’t realize it. The
effect is similar.)
Giving the PCs simultaneous scenario hooks for multiple
adventures at the same time also inherently means that some of
them won’t be immediately pursued. In combination with having
multiple scenario hooks per scenario, this also allows lore to
accumulate.
BAIT HOOKS
Some scenario hooks don’t actually point to scenarios. Instead,
these bait hooks only exist in order to put the PCs in a position
where they can be confronted with the real scenario.
For example, the PCs might be hired to guard a package of
diamonds that’s being delivered to a bank vault, but the only
reason the job exists (and it might even go off without a hitch)
is to put the PCs in the bank when the bank robbers show up.
The bait hook is usually a device of the GM, but it can also be
diegetic when an NPC gives the PCs a false job offer in order to
maneuver them into a location or situation for an ulterior
purpose. This plot conceit is quite common in pulp fiction, for
example, when detectives are hired to keep a person or location
under observation and end up being framed for a crime.

TREASURE MAPS

Treasure maps are worth calling out as a specific type of scenario
hook because they mesh so well with exploration-type scenarios like
a typical dungeon (see here) or hexcrawl (see here).
The default action of these types of scenarios is basically “pick a
direction and see what you find.” In other words, if you’re ever
uncertain about what you should be doing in a dungeon, you can
never go too far wrong by just picking a random door and seeing
what’s on the other side.
That’s fine as far as it goes, but if the players remain limited to
random choice, then they can’t make meaningful choices (and that’s
where the real meat of the game is). Fortunately, all scenario hooks
create specificity. In other words, they give the players a specific
goal to pursue instead of a generic one. They’re no longer opening
doors or picking directions at random; they’re trying to find one
specific place or find one specific thing.
Treasure maps do the same thing, but they do it particularly well
in exploration scenarios: Once the PCs spot a landmark depicted on
the map, they’ll be able to start orienting themselves using the map
as a guide. Possibly a riddling or imperfect one, but a guide
nonetheless.
The best part is that a treasure map can take almost any form and
it can be used to point at almost anything.

SUPPORTING CAST
Your worlds will be filled with countless nonplayer characters, a
vast panorama of roles covering the gamut of humanity and beyond.
These roles—and playing these roles—are the lifeblood of a truly

great RPG campaign, literally bringing it to life for you and your
players.
I’m not going to pretend that this is easy. It’s a challenge just
roleplaying one character, let alone a legion of them. (A fun
challenge, but a challenge nonetheless.) So this extra credit is going
to focus on some tools and principles I’ve found useful in creating
and running my supporting cast.

THE UNIVERSAL NPC ROLEPLAYING
TEMPLATE

The more important an NPC is, the more detailed they become. But
the more detailed they are, the more their description becomes an
unwieldy mass that’s almost impossible to parse during the pressure
of actual play. And so, ironically, the more important an NPC is, the
more difficult it becomes to run them smoothly and effectively at
the table.
You do your best, of course, but how are you going to fish all the
little details out of that wall of text? And three scenes later you
realize that everything has spun out of control because you forgot
that the NPC was supposed to tell the PCs about the properties of
the Starstone, but that was hidden away as a single sentence in the
fourth paragraph!
Which also means, as you create your own NPCs, that you’ll find
yourself wasting a lot of time writing up lengthy descriptions that
never seem to have any real impact at the table. You need to figure
out a better way of organizing your NPCs so that you can just focus
on the important stuff. (Plus, it would be great, when the players
decide to spontaneously visit the guy they met 12 sessions ago, if
you could quickly pick that NPC up and start playing him again.)
Or maybe you’re really good at juggling all those little details, but
you struggle when it comes to really getting into character or
making each of your NPCs a unique, distinct, and memorable
individual.

Well, that’s what the Universal NPC Roleplaying Template is all
about.
The template is designed so that it doesn’t take any extra effort to
prep compared to the traditional “wall of text” presentations, but it
structures the NPC’s description into utilitarian categories that will
(a) focus your prep and (b) make it incredibly easy to use during
actual play. I’ve found that I can design NPCs with this technique,
lay them aside for months at a time, and then pick them back up
again in the middle of play without any review: Instead of trying to
parse several paragraphs of dense text, the template will guide you
directly to the information you need.
NAME
Self-explanatory. (Or, at least, I hope it is.)
APPEARANCE
Essentially a boxed-text description that you can use when the PCs
meet the NPC for the first time. Get it pithy. One or two sentences is
the sweet spot. Three sentences is pretty much the maximum length
you should use unless there’s something truly and outrageously
unusual about the character. Remember that you don’t need to
describe every single thing about them. Pick out their most
interesting and unique features and let your players’ imaginations
paint in the rest.
You can also include a picture of the NPC at the top of your
briefing sheet. This image can also be shown to the players, of
course, but is also useful for quickly finding the NPC you’re looking
for during play.
BRIEFING SHEETS
When I’m using this template, I’m often thinking of and using
the NPCs as briefing sheets: I only put one NPC on each page.
(And, in fact, it’s usually just one NPC per sheet, so that the
opposite side of the page is blank.)

When setting up a scene, this allows me to quickly “cast” the
NPCs in it by simply grabbing the appropriate sheets and laying
them out in front of me. That way I can just swap between
characters with a flick of my eye. (I usually keep my campaign
notes in a three-ring binder, so I just pop out the relevant
pages.)
When running a scenario using the social event scenario
structure (see here), I can similarly just pull all the guests’
briefing sheets and then quickly riffle through them, making it
easy to quickly mix and remix the social situations the PCs are
in.
ROLEPLAYING
This is the heart of the template, but it should also be the shortest
section. Two or three brief bullet points at most. You’re looking to
identify the essential elements that will “unlock” the character for
you.
There are no firm rules here, but I will always try to include at
least one simple, physical action that you can perform while playing
the character at the table. For example, maybe they tap their ear. Or
are constantly wearing a creepy smile. Or they arch an eyebrow. Or
they speak with a particular accent or affectation. Or they clap their
hands and rub them together. Or snap their fingers and point at the
person they’re talking to. Or make a point of taking a slow sip from
their drink before responding to questions.
You don’t have to make a big deal of it and it usually won’t be
something that you do constantly (that gets annoying), but the
mannerism is your hook: You’ll find that you can quickly get back
into the character by simply performing the mannerism. It will also
make your players remember the NPC as a distinct individual. And
it can even make playing scenes with multiple NPCs easier to run
(because you can use mannerisms to clearly distinguish the
characters you’re swapping between).

You’ll generally only need one mannerism. Maybe two. More than
that and you lose the simple utility of the mannerism in unnecessary
complexity. It’s not that the character’s entire personality is this one
thing; it’s that the rest of the character’s personality will flow out of
you whenever you hit that touchstone.
Round this out with personality traits and general attitude. Are
they friendly? Hostile? Greedy? Ruthless? Is there a particular
negotiating tactic they like? Will they always offer you a drink? Will
they fly into a rage if insulted? You may find that a properly crafted
quote can be a very effective way of capturing the NPC’s unique
voice. But, again, keep it simple and to the point. You want to be
able to glance at this section, process the information almost
instantaneously, and start playing the character. You don’t need a
full-blown psychological profile and, in fact, that would be
counterproductive.
PSYCHOLOGICAL GESTURE
If you want to do a truly deep dive into the power of using gesture
and mannerism to assume character, check out Michael Chekhov’s
On the Technique of Acting.
BACKGROUND
This section is narrative in nature. You can let it breathe a bit more
than the other sections if you like, but a little will still go a long
way. I tend to think of this in terms of essential context and
interesting anecdotes. Is it something that will directly influence
the decisions they make? Is it information that the PCs are likely to
discover about them (e.g., in conversation with them, talking to
other people, or doing a background check)? Is it an interesting
story that the NPC might tell about themselves or (better yet) use as
context for explaining something? Great. If it’s just a short story
about some random person’s life that you’re writing for an audience
of one, refocus your attention on prepping material that’s relevant
to the players.

BACKGROUND BOLD
Use bold text to call out key concepts in the “Background”
section. For example:
Background: Bhaltair is Ariadnan of Caledonian stock. During
the frontier conflict between Caledonia and Rodina, his father
fought in the war and never came back. Bhaltair lost
himself in drink for a while but got clean and made a pledge
that he would work to never see his home world torn apart by
such senseless violence again. He has recently arrived to take
part in the Alliance Summit.
KEY INFO
Finally, in a bullet point format, lay out the essential interaction or
information the PCs are supposed to get from the NPC (if any). The
nature of this section will vary depending on the scenario and the
NPC’s role in it, but the most obvious example is a mystery scenario
(see here) in which the NPC has a clue. Rather than burying that
clue in the narrative of the NPC’s background, what you want to do
is yank it out and place it in this list to make sure you don’t lose
track of it during play.
(The Three Clue Rule applies, of course, so just because something
appears in this section, it doesn’t mean that the PCs will
automatically get it. You’re just making sure they don’t miss it
because you screwed up.)
You could also use this section to lay out the terms of
employment being offered by the Mysterious Man in the Tavern. Or
to list the discounts offered by a shopkeeper. It’s a flexible tool. In
some cases, it could get quite long, but it’s essential that you keep it
well organized (which is why you’re using bullet points). If it just
becomes a giant wall of text, its essential function has been lost. To
this end, you may sometimes find it useful to split voluminous
material into multiple Key Info sections, such as:

Key Info—Clues

Key Info—Topics of Conversation
With the former, obviously, listing all the clues, while the latter
has any notes pertaining to the various topics of conversation being
bandied about at the party.
Divisions based on topic may also be useful. For example, an NPC
might have some information on werewolf sightings and also a
lengthy account of the Haunting of Greybear Mansion, and thus:
Key Info—Werewolf Sightings
Key Info—Greybear Mansion

Of course, just because one NPC has their information broken up
like this, it doesn’t mean that every other NPC in the scenario needs
their Key Info broken up in the same way (or at all). Most of the
time, a single Key Info section with a couple bullet points is all you
need.
LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS
If the PCs have a long-term relationship with an NPC, it’s not
necessary for them to divulge every piece of key information they
have the first time they meet. In fact, it’s probably a bad idea! You
can pace out those interactions. You could even create a custom
rumor table (see here) for very important NPCs, allowing you to
randomly determine which bit of info might be dropped each time
the PCs interact with them.
STAT BLOCK
If you need stats for the NPC, put ’em on the bottom of the briefing
sheet in whatever format makes sense for the system you’re running.
(If your system uses a particularly long stat block format, you might
need to put the stat block on the opposite side of the sheet.)

VIVID & MEMORABLE NPCs

Now that you have a template for your NPCs, what do you actually
pour into that template? How do you create fully realized characters
that will captivate, infuriate, and enthrall your players? The types of
characters that they’ll remember for the rest of the campaign, or
even the rest of their lives.
First, give your NPC a distinct mannerism. I already called this
out specifically in the Roleplaying section of the template, but it’s so
vital as a touchstone for both your roleplaying and the players’
memory of the character that I’m mentioning it again.
Second, give the NPC a strong agenda. Make them want
something. Better yet? A pair of agendas. If they’re agendas that
partly conflict with each other, even better.
TEMPLATE EXAMPLE: SYR ARION
Appearance: A man in the flush of youth: Short-cropped, jetblack hair sets off his piercing blue eyes. His frame is only
lightly muscled, but toned and trained. The weight of his office,
however, has left bags beneath his eyes, and his shoulders
stoop with responsibility.
Roleplaying:
A passionate man, but—increasingly—a weary one.

In desperate need of friends, but years of experience and loss
have taught him not to trust lightly.
Rests his chin heavily into the palm of his hand.

Background: Arion’s mother died in childbirth, and he was
reared as the last scion of the Erradons by his father, a man
whose faculties were already deserting him when Arion was
born. Arion’s father believed that his brother had been killed by
the Guild, and the one edict he never wavered from was that
Arion should be strictly sequestered. As a result, the only true

friend Arion had while growing up was Celadon, the Captain of
the Prince’s Guard—a man 30 years his senior.
Despite this, or perhaps because of it, Arion dedicated himself
to rigorous self-perfection: When he was not learning
swordplay from Celadon, he was spending hours poring over
the musty tomes in his father’s library. He saw that his father
was a poor ruler and believed it was his place to restore the
honor of the Erradons by restoring the glory of Dweredell.
It actually works best if this agenda is not aimed directly at the
PCs. “I want to destroy the PCs!” is nice and all, but something that
simply overlaps the PCs’ areas of interest is usually more effective. If
the PCs’ actions/knowledge/connections/whatever could help (or
hinder) the NPC, having the NPC discover that during their
interaction with the PCs (or having the PCs discover it and then
decide what they want to do with that knowledge themselves)
instantly makes for a powerful scene.
This is not a universal rule, obviously. There’s nothing wrong with
a patron showing up and simply wanting the PCs to do something
for them. But the less the players think “X exists because the GM
wants us to do Y,” the more they will think of X as an actual person.
Third, throw out a plethora of NPCs and then pay attention to
which ones “click” with the players. Focus on those and be okay
with letting NPCs that aren’t clicking move on with their lives. (This
is discussed a bit more in the Social Events section starting on page
361, but it’s equally true as a general principle.)
Fourth, along these same lines, apply Neel Krishnaswami’s Law of
the Conservation of NPCs: Whenever you’re designing a scenario
and need to include an NPC, rather than designing a new NPC, start
by checking to see if any of the existing NPCs in the campaign could
be used to fill the role.
There are several major benefits to reincorporating NPCs like this:

It limits the cast of characters in your campaign, giving both you
and your players fewer characters to keep track of.
It allows NPCs to appear more frequently, giving you more
practice playing them and the PCs more time to develop deep,
complex relationships with them.

It reveals and develops multiple facets of the character over time,
turning them into more interesting and well-rounded individuals.
Fifth, connect the NPCs to each other and give them strong,
contradictory opinions about each other. If everyone thinks Lord
Bakersfield is a pompous asshole, eh, whatever. That’s fine. If some
people think he’s a pompous asshole and other people think he’s the
greatest man they’ve ever met (and they both have cause to think
so), Lord Bakersfield is a much more interesting character.
This also basically forces the players (and their PCs) to make up
their own minds about Lord Bakersfield: Is he an asshole? Is he a
great man? Both? And, if so, which is more important? That means
they’ll need to think meaningfully about him as a character, and
that’s step one to memorability.
REINCORPORATE EVERYTHING!
Reusing an NPC isn’t the only way you can reincorporate elements
of the campaign into new scenarios. If you’re designing a dungeon
scenario set in a ruined monastery, for example, it could be just any
old monastery. But what if the monastery once belonged to the same
religious faction as the party’s cleric? Now the adventure is more
personal for the PCs, and can develop the lore of the cleric’s faith in
a way that will continue paying dividends for the rest of the
campaign.
Characters, locations, events, organizations, and even esoteric
knowledge like history or arcane metaphysics can all become richer
by virtue of being reused.

THE PRINCIPLES OF RPG VILLAINY

It’s a classic scene from countless pulp adventures: After taunting
the heroes, the villain swoops out of the scene. Our protagonists
watch impotently as he escapes, building the rivalry between them
and whetting our appetites for the finale of the story!
It’s an effective trope—and guided by the books, movies, and
graphic novels we love, it’s not unusual for new GMs to try to
include it in their adventures … only for the PCs to shoot the villain
dead.
“You can’t do that!” the new GM thinks. “You’re ruining the story!
My bad guy simply must get away!”
Maybe the new GM even cheats, negating the choices and
accomplishments of the PCs in order to force their preconceived
outcome. The problem, though, is that when you push your thumb
on the scales of fate in order to predetermine the outcome of your
game, you deflate the value of that outcome. If you do it poorly (or
simply do it often enough), the anger and frustration of the players
will stop focusing on the NPC villain and it will start focusing on
you!
The core truth is that roleplaying games—unlike books or movies
or graphic novels—aren’t linear media with predetermined
outcomes. They’re interactive media with emergent narratives that
are created through active play.
Does this mean that we can’t have long-term villains in a
roleplaying game? Of course not! It just means that villains don’t
work the same way in an RPG as they do in other mediums.
Here are the three Principles of RPG Villainy:
PRINCIPLE #1
Build tension between the PCs and the villain without using direct
confrontations between them. Give the bad guy minions and
introduce other NPCs who have a relationship with them (an exboyfriend, a family member, a victim, etc.). Have the bad guy do
horrible things off-screen to people, places, and organizations the
PCs care about. Staging social interactions in situations where the

PCs won’t be able to simply shoot them in the head without serious
consequences also works well to build a personal relationship, as do
taunting communiqués and phone calls.
PRINCIPLE #2
When you’re prepping your scenarios, include lots of bad guys.
You’re probably doing this anyway, so the real key here is to simply
refrain from pre-investing one of these guys as the “big villain.”
Basically, don’t get attached to any of your antagonists: Assume that
the first time they’re in a position where the PCs might kill them, the
PCs will definitely kill them. (You’ll be right more often than not.)
PRINCIPLE #3
Remember that people in the real world usually don’t fight to the
death. Have your bad guys run away. And not just your “big villain”
(since you won’t have one of those anyway): Unless their back is
truly to the wall, most of the people your PCs fight should try to
escape once a fight turns against them. Most of them will probably
still end up with a bullet in the back of their heads, but some of
them will manage to escape.
The ones that escape?
Those are your memorable villains. They’re your major
antagonists.
This is the crucial inversion: Instead of figuring out who your
major bad guy is and then predetermining that they will escape to
wreak their vengeance, what’s happening here is that the guy who
escapes to wreak their vengeance becomes the major bad guy.
Consider Die Hard for a moment. As written, the film is a great
example of our first principle in action, with the antagonism
between John McClane and Hans Gruber being established almost
entirely without any interaction between the two of them.
Gruber takes McClane’s wife hostage.

They talk to each other through notes and walkie-talkies.

Gruber sends his thugs to fight McClane elsewhere in the
building.
The exception to this is the scene where Gruber pretends to be
one of the hostages. This is a really clever device that heightens the
conflict between McClane and Gruber by allowing them to directly
interact with each other. But if this was a game table, what would
happen if the PCs saw through Gruber’s bluff and put a bullet
through his forehead right then and there?
It doesn’t matter.
Remember our second principle? Lots of bad guys. So now Die
Hard becomes the story of the hotheaded Karl Vreski taking control
of Gruber’s delicate operation and blowing it up in a mad pursuit for
vengeance. Maybe he starts killing hostages and becomes the most
memorable villain of the campaign when he throws McClane’s wife
off the top of Nakatomi Plaza.
Okay, so cycling through the org-chart of Villains, Inc., works if
you’re using a team of bad guys. But what if the PCs really are
facing off against a single nemesis?
First off, remember that not every challenge needs to be of epic
proportions: Sometimes you run into some goblins in the woods and
you kill them and you move on. You don’t need every goblin to
murder the priestess’s cousin or become the blood-sworn enemy of
the paladin.
Second, even the most memorable villains from fiction are often
part of Villains, Inc., even when that isn’t immediately obvious. For
example, consider Dracula: Wouldn’t it be really unsatisfying if
Jonathan Harker snuck into Dracula’s tomb at the beginning of the
book and staked him through the heart before he ever went to
England? I mean … this is the Dracula, right?
Remember, though, that Dracula only became the Dracula because
that didn’t happen at the hypothetical gaming table. If we were
running this as an actual scenario, then we wouldn’t know that he’s
“supposed” to become obsessed with Harker’s wife and kill Mina’s
best friend in pursuit of her. We would discover that during play. So

let’s pretend that play had gone a different way: Harker stakes
Dracula and heads back to England, satisfied that he’s destroyed an
ancient evil. It’s a beautiful, happy ending to a short pulp horror
adventure story.
… until the Brides of Dracula pursue him back to England seeking
bloody vengeance.
Dracula? Schmacula.
He was just the appetizer.
Our hypothetical GM has included lots of bad guys, allowed them
to die indiscriminately, and let a major villain naturally emerge in a
way that’s delightfully/horrifically surprising for everyone at the
table.
Fake examples like this from other forms of media can be useful
due to the common understanding we have of the source material,
but can also be misleading because the official version of events
from the original media lends a patina of canonicity that shouldn’t
be true of actual tabletop scenarios. So let me offer a couple of
examples from an actual D&D campaign that I ran.
Silion was a cult leader. Using our first principle, I built her up in
a variety of ways: Her name was referenced in early foreshadowing.
The PCs tangled with her thugs and were targeted for retaliation by
her organization. She was also incorporated into the background of
a new PC joining the campaign, becoming responsible for murdering
the PC’s family and destroying their village.
Eventually, the PCs managed to track down her lair. They snuck
in, found her digging through a box of archaeological artifacts,
rolled a critical hit, and put an arrow through the back of her skull.
She literally never even got a chance to look them in the face.
My players gleefully tell this story at almost every opportunity.
They love it. It’s one of their favorite moments from the entire
campaign.
Why did it work?
Because when you heavily invest in a villain through
foreshadowing, the payoff for defeating them is massively satisfying.
It can be argued that this sort of thing might not work as well in

other media (although consider that Luke’s physical confrontation
with the Emperor in Return of the Jedi, after building up to it over
the course of three films, lasts almost no time at all), but in a
roleplaying game the audience is synonymous with the protagonist.
Your players don’t want to be handed their quarry on a plate, but a
quick kill shot isn’t a gimme: It’s a reward for all the work that got
them to the point where they could take the shot.
Here’s another example from the opposite end of the spectrum.
Arveth was a mook. She was captured by the PCs, questioned by
Tithenmamiwen, and then cut loose. When Elestra, another PC, tried
to sneak back and slit Arveth’s throat to stop her from warning the
other cultists, Tithenmamiwen stopped her.
But then the cultists caught up with Arveth: Believing that she
had betrayed them to the PCs, they tortured her and even cut out
her eye. Eventually concluding that Arveth was still loyal to their
cause, however, the cult gave her a team of assassins and sent her to
kill Tithenmamiwen.
This was our second principle: Use lots of bad guys and develop
the ones who survive. In some other campaign, Arveth could have
easily been cut down randomly during combat and completely
forgotten by the next session.
Targeting Tithenmamiwen when she was alone, Arveth nearly
succeeded in her assassination attempt before the rest of the party
showed up. While the rest of her team held the party at bay, Arveth
managed to escape (barely evading Tithenmamiwen’s angry
pursuit). This was our third principle: When they’re losing a fight,
have your bad guys run away.
At this point, things transitioned back to the first principle: Arveth
used a magical artifact to send horrible nightmares to
Tithenmamiwen,
often
featuring
Arveth
cutting
out
Tithenmamiwen’s eye. She issued threats to Tithenmamiwen’s
friends. She placed a bounty on Tithenmamiwen’s head.
Tithenmamiwen responded, hiring spies to hunt down Arveth and
leaving Arveth messages on the bodies of cultists she killed along
the way.

The PCs would eventually fight Arveth again. This time Arveth
was teamed up with a medusa who turned two of the party
members to stone. Arveth carved an eye out of each of the statues
before making her escape once again.
By this point, of course, the PCs were absolutely furious.
Tithenmamiwen, in particular, had a rage that burned so white-hot
that her alignment actually shifted: She had shown this bitch mercy
and she was repaid with endless torment. I don’t think I’ve ever seen
such intense hatred focused toward an NPC before. It reshaped the
entire course of the campaign.
Arveth was a mook no more.
When she finally died, the cheers of the players rocked the house.
They literally took her miniature as a trophy so that it could never
be used in a game again.
These are the villains that will be remembered forever by your
players.
And by you.

ROLEPLAYING IN COMBAT

Roleplaying your bad guys during combat is tough. There’s a ton of
stuff you’re keeping track of, with a bunch of rules flying back and
forth. Plus, the action is broken up in a weird, semi-artificial way
through the initiative count. It’s just really easy for roleplaying to
slip through the cracks.
There are a couple key ways to patch up those cracks.
First, remember that combat decisions ARE roleplaying. Seeing
your mentor cut down, roaring in rage, and throwing yourself at her
killer is every bit as much roleplaying as a scene filled with witty
repartee. So make those combat decisions as the character; don’t just
treat them as playing pieces in a melee simulator.
Second, make a point of having characters talk on their initiative
count. That might be:
Dialogue directed at the PCs.

Leaders shouting orders to their minions.
Cries of pain or anguish.

Chunks of an ongoing monologue.
And so forth. These are all things that can be directly associated
to the actions they’re taking on their turn, but they don’t have to be.
If you’re still struggling, turn the initiative count entirely to your
advantage by literally adding “NPC Says Something” to your
initiative tracker in one or more spots. When you hit that entry on
the tracker, be compelled to actually do it.
If you make a point of setting an example for the players, you’ll
likely be able to draw them out and get them roleplaying through
combat, too. And that back-and-forth will make it easier for all of
you.

IMPROVISING YOUR SUPPORTING CAST

No matter how many NPCs you prep, at some point the players will
say, out of the blue, “Hey! Let’s talk to this random guy on the
street!” or “We need to find a mercenary. Let’s go ask around at the
Irontooth Arena.” And in that moment, you will need that random
NPC to spring full-blown from your brow like Zeus giving birth to
Athena.
Improvisation is tough (although it’s something you can practice
and get better at), and improvising an entire character on the fly
and out of nothing is even tougher. What you need is a minimum
profile—a simple template—that you can quickly snap into place.
What you need is:
a name,

a descriptive detail,

a roleplaying mannerism, and
an agenda.

Names are usually tough for people to come up with on demand
and off the top of their heads, so I recommend always keeping a list
of random names in your notes. On the facing page you can find a
list of fantasy names that I’ve used in basically every D&D campaign
I’ve run for the past 15 years. When the PCs approach a random
NPC, I just pick up the list, pick a name, and cross it off. At the start
of a new campaign, I print off a new copy and start over again.
The best part is that the process of picking up this piece of paper
and looking at it, if handled properly, is indistinguishable from
looking at any of your other notes. It buys you a valuable breath of
time in which to brainstorm the unexpected NPC and then put your
thoughts in order before opening your mouth. Plus, your players
won’t be able to distinguish between the NPCs you prepped and the
NPCs you didn’t (since you’re “checking your notes” either way).
You may find real-world names easier to come up with, but I still
recommend prepping a list, particularly if your campaign or
scenario is set in a culture you’re unfamiliar with.
As far as a descriptive detail and a roleplaying mannerism
goes, you can prep or find similar random lists that you can use. But
a quick and effective shortcut is to mentally “cast” your NPC as an
actor or actress you’re familiar with.
You’re bad at impersonations? Perfect! The players won’t even
recognize where you’re pulling the character from.
Genre flips can have a similar effect: Ian McKellan’s Gandalf is
basically an archetype at this point, so you could easily have a
wizard show up smoking a pipe, waggling their eyebrows, and
speaking cryptically in dramatic whispers and no one’s going to bat
an eye. But use those same mannerisms for a mafioso or Luke

Skywalker’s characterization for a petulant halfling and your players
will probably never realize where you drew your inspiration from.

Figuring out an agenda for a bit character can be the toughest
thing to do, and some will even argue that it’s not really necessary.
But figuring out what a character wants and what they’re trying to
achieve, even if it’s completely tangential to the scene, is the best
way, in my opinion, to bring them vividly to life.
The agenda is highly dependent on the specific circumstances of
the character and the scene, but it can be useful to remember that it
doesn’t have to be of earth-shattering importance. The NPC might
just be here to buy soap. That can be enough.
Assuming that your setting is already well stocked with NPCs,
however, another thing you can do is basically just co-opt an
existing NPC’s agenda. This makes sense: In the real world, after all,
there’s not just one guy who’s pro-Brexit or trying to buy real estate

in the Guildsman’s District or aligned with the Mafia or engaging in
anti-android-apartheid activism.
So add this new NPC to one of these existing factions of interest.
It works best to then give their agenda a twist so that it’s
providing a different angle or insight into the agenda. The easiest
twist is to simply flip the agenda and have them opposed to
whatever the other NPC is trying to accomplish: So they’re antiBrexit, trying to protect middle-class property rights in the
Guildsman’s District, a gangbuster, or an android-tester enforcing
the apartheid.

SPLITTING THE PARTY
“Never split the party.”
It’s a popular maxim, and for good reason.

First, splitting the party divides its strength, making each group
weaker and more vulnerable. (Which is particularly problematic if
you’re playing in a paradigm where adventures are primarily
combat encounters and those combat encounters have all been
balanced to leave your full group poised on the edge of total
destruction. Nothing good can come from splitting up in those
conditions.)
Second, it places an undue burden on the GM, who now needs to
keep track of two separate tracks of continuity while also making
sure to juggle spotlight time between the groups.
There’s some truth to both of these concerns, which is why “never
split the party” is great advice for newbies.
But once you have a little experience under your belts, things get
slightly more complicated.
Let’s start with the PCs: If you’re in hostile territory … yeah,
splitting the party is probably a bad idea. But once your adventures
leave the dungeon, there are going to be lots of times when you’re
not operating in hostile territory and can gain huge benefits from
multiplying your active fronts.
Think in terms of action economy: If you all stick together, you’ll
be stuck doing one thing at a time. If you split up, on the other
hand, you can often be doing two or three or five things at the same
time, stealing a march on your opposition or just moving quicker
toward your goals. Being able to pursue multiple leads at the same
time in a mystery scenario—particularly if you’re trying to wrap up
the case before the serial killer can strike again!—is a great example
of this.
This can also make it easier for different characters to pursue
actions that play to their unique strengths, making it less likely for a
player to get stuck in “passive mode” watching other players do
everything important. When two actions of the same type need to
happen at the same time, it’s also a great opportunity for someone
who’s second-best at something to get a chance to showcase their
skills, whereas normally the group likely defaults to having the
character with the best modifier always make the check.

Splitting up can also be good for personal scenes: It’s hard to woo
your lady love with four wingmen/women/people hovering over
your shoulder all the time.
On the GM’s side of the screen, I love it when the PCs split up. Not
out of malevolent glee, but because once you know what you’re
doing, running the game for a split party is GMing on Easy Mode™.
The trick is that when the whole group is together, you have very
limited control over pacing: You can end a scene and frame a new
one, but that’s about it. As soon as the PCs split up, though, you’re
immediately inundated with a deluge of new options.
TALKING ABOUT SCENES
If you haven’t already, you may want to check out the chapter on
framing Scenes (see here). It may make some of the techniques we
discuss here a little clearer.

CUT IN THE MIDDLE OF SCENES

For the GM, almost every advantage of splitting the party flows
from the simple fact that instead of being limited to cutting to a new
scene only when the previous scene has come to an end, you can
now cut away in the middle of Group A’s scene, jump to Group B’s
scene, and then jump back to finish Group A’s scene. In fact, you
can do this repeatedly between simultaneous scenes.
It takes a little extra juggling to keep track of the continuity
between the two groups, but there are so many ways you can use
this new power.
Cut on a new bang. “The door is suddenly blown open with
plastic explosives! Colonel Kurtz steps through the mangled
wreckage, the firelight gleaming on his monocle! Meanwhile, on
the other side of town …”
Cut on the choice. Remember that a roleplaying game is,
ultimately, a conversation of meaningful choices. When a doozy

of a choice comes along, cut to the other group.

Cut on the roll of the dice. This leaves the outcome in suspense,
but it also has the practical effect of eliminating the mechanical
pause while the dice are rolled and the modifiers are added. The
players are doing all of that while something exciting is
happening to the other group, and when that other group gets to
their own action check—BAM! You cut back to the first group,
collect the result, and instantly move forward with the action.

Cut whenever a player is preoccupied. This is purely a practical
cut, but at any point where a player needs to look up a rule or
perform a complex calculation or read through a handout, you
can eliminate dead air at the gaming table by swapping over to
the other group.
Cut whenever you’re not needed. Are the PCs in Group A
discussing their options or reviewing their notes? Cut to Group B!
I love this cut, because the players in Group A are still
roleplaying even while I’m doing stuff with Group B. Because
you’re doubling up this time, literally everyone at the table is
getting to play more than they normally would. Splitting the
party actually increases spotlight time! It’s like you’re stealing
fire from the gods.

CLIFFHANGERS
In practice or effect, a lot of these cuts between split groups create
cliffhangers: The players want to know what will happen next, but
you’re denying that to them. You’re making them wait for it.
This is great, because if I could only give one tip to GMs about
pacing in RPGs, it would be to do a cliffhanger every single time the
opportunity presents itself. It’s virtually impossible to have too
many of them.
The trick, though, is that when EVERYONE wants to know what
will happen next, that includes you! You’ll be just as eager and
excited as the players, so it’ll be really tempting to just keep playing
and find out the answer.

But this is why you’re sitting in the big seat: You’ve got to
recognize that desire and then resist it, so that everyone—including
you—can enjoy it even more!

CROSSOVERS

Once you’ve mastered the basic juggling of simultaneous scenes, you
can enrich the experience by tying those scenes together through
crossovers.
The simplest type of crossover is a direct crossover. This is where
an element or outcome from one scene appears immediately in a
different scene. For example, if one group blows up the arms depot,
then the other group might hear the explosion from across town. Or
Colonel Kurtz flees from one group of PCs and ends up running back
to his office … which the other PCs are currently searching.
Indirect crossovers are both subtler and more varied. These are
common or related elements in each scene that are not identical. For
example, you might have Franklin discover a cult manual bearing
the sign of a white cobra while, simultaneously, John sees a white
cobra painted on the face of his murdered wife.
An indirect crossover might not have any specific connection in
the game world whatsoever: For example, Suzy might ask Rick out
for a date at the Italian Stallion on Friday night. Simultaneously, in
a different scene, Bobby gets ordered by his police lieutenant to
arrange surveillance for a mob boss meeting at the same restaurant
at the same time. Suzy and Rick have no connection to the mob or
the police, but that’s still a crossover.
This also demonstrates how crossovers can be used to weave
disconnected narratives together: Suzy, Rick, and Bobby are all
going to end up at that restaurant at the same time. Franklin and
John are both going to be launching separate investigations into the
white cobra. It’s still not clear exactly how their paths are going to
cross, but they’ve definitely been set on a collision course.
This technique can be particularly effective at the beginning of a
scenario or campaign: Instead of having the PCs all meet in a bar,

you can instead launch them all into separate scenes and then seed
crossovers into those scenes to slowly and organically draw them all
together.
Another way of using these techniques is to strengthen the role of
player-as-audience-member. You know that moment in a horror
movie where the audience doesn’t want a character to open a door
because they know something the character doesn’t? Hard to do in
an RPG … unless the table knows it (because it was established in a
different scene), but the PC doesn’t. (This assumes, of course, that
your players can handle a separation of PC and player knowledge.)

THE TIME CRUNCH

The party doesn’t have to be constantly facing do-or-die deadlines,
but putting the PCs under a time crunch can be effective in a lot of
different ways. It makes every choice between A or B significant,
because they may not have time to do A and then also do B.
You don’t even need to set a plethora of explicit deadlines to
make time relevant. Just having a campaign world that is active—in
which the players can see that significant things happen over time
and that situations evolve even when they’re not directly interacting
with them—will create not just the perception, but the reality that
time matters, and that’s all that’s needed to feel the pressure of time.
A natural result of this time pressure is that it will encourage the
party to split up: Facing a difficult choice between A or B, they’ll cut
the Gordian knot by breaking into two groups and doing both.
So have multiple things happening at the same time: Two
different patrons wanting to hire them for jobs on the same day. An
unexpected crisis breaking out just as they’re getting ready to go do
a thing. When they’re in the middle of doing something, use a cell
phone or a sending spell to have a desperate friend call them for
help.

WHO’S FIRST?

When a group splits up, whose scene should you frame first?

I recommend usually looking for the group whose scene is most
likely to be interrupted the fastest. This interruption might be
a complicated decision,
a skill check,

some sort of logistical calculation,
a dramatically appropriate moment, or
a rules lookup.

Basically any of the reasons you’d normally cut from one scene to
another.
The reason you’re starting with the scene most likely to be
interrupted the fastest is pretty straightforward: You’re dipping your
toes in the first scene, and then as quickly as possible cutting away
to another group. Not only does this keep everyone engaged, but
you’re getting to the time-saving advantage of multitasking as
quickly as possible (with Group 1 continuing to resolve stuff or
discuss stuff in their scene while you’ve turned your attention to
Group 2).
LOOK FOR CROSSOVERS
The slightly more advanced technique here is to look for effective
crossovers between the scenes and then make sure you’re sequencing
the scenes to set those up for maximum effect.

BALANCE SPOTLIGHT

Regardless of splitting the party, you generally want every player to
be contributing equally and to have an equal amount of time in the
“spotlight” (i.e., getting to show off the cool stuff they can do, being
responsible for the group’s success, etc.).
Once the group splits up, therefore, you want to avoid what I call
the “lone wolf spotlight,” in which one PC wanders off by

themselves and ends up getting fully half of the GM’s attention. This
can sometimes be a symptom of disruptive play (with the lone
wolf’s activities interfering with the other players’ fun), in which
case the increased spotlight time is actually rewarding the bad
behavior, but this is usually not the case. (There are lots of reasons
why one PC might head off to take care of something by
themselves.)
Solving the problem is just a matter of keeping in mind the
general principle of everyone getting an equal share of the spotlight.
Instead of splitting your attention equally between groups, split it
evenly between players: If one group has four PCs in it and the
other group has one PC in it, you should usually spend four times as
long focusing on the larger group.
(There can be lots of exceptions to this. Juggling spotlight time is
more art than rigid turn-keeping. Maybe the smaller group is doing
something much more important and gets a lot of focus in the first
half of the session, and then you can make sure the other PCs get
extra spotlight time in the second half of the session or at next
week’s session.)
A related pitfall is thinking you need to keep time between the
two groups strictly synced. So if Group A is staying put while Group
B is driving 15 minutes across town, you would need to resolve 15
minutes of activity with Group A before you could even think about
cutting to Group B.
This can very easily make it impossible to effectively split
spotlight time or cut between groups.
The solution, of course, is to simply not keep time synced: Start
running the scene with Group A, then cut “forward” to Group B
arriving at their destination. Run a bit of that interaction, then cut
“backward” to Group A.
This can sound complicated, but in practice it really isn’t. You can
stress yourself out thinking about all the ways the PCs could
hypothetically violate causality, but you either (a) say that isn’t an
option or (b) perform a simple retcon or flashback to resolve the
conflict (whichever is most appropriate to the situation). Your

players will help you do this in a way that makes sense for
everyone. (Plus, in practice, timekeeping in the game world isn’t
that precise to begin with, so you’ve usually got a pretty wide
margin of fuzziness to fudge things around.)
CONTINUOUS COMMUNICATION
What if the PCs have cell phones or earpieces or some other
form of continual communication unlimited by distance that
can trivially breach the continuity between the two groups?
Often, the net effect here is that the party isn’t actually split:
Even though they’re in two locations, each group is able to
participate in what the other group is doing (by offering advice,
etc.). This makes it substantially less important to balance
spotlight time between the groups, since players can grab a
slice of spotlight for themselves over the comms line.

JOINT INITIATIVE LISTS

If the PCs split up and get into two fights simultaneously, make a
single initiative list, then just swap between the fights whenever the
initiative order tells you to.
Running two combats at the same time is often seen as the worstcase scenario for a split party, but the structure of the initiative list
can actually act like training wheels and make it the easiest. If
you’re trying to get a feel for what running simultaneous scenes
should feel like—cutting between groups, balancing spotlight time,
etc.—running simultaneous combat can be a great way to do it.

TO THE FUTURE!

YOU’VE COME TO the end of So You Want to Be a Game Master

and I hope that many of you have already begun running your first
campaigns, sharing your amazing worlds and ideas with your
players, and creating memories of the fantastic that will last a
lifetime.
So what’s next?
Run more games!
I once told you that I’ve run entire campaigns using nothing but
dungeons. Now you have dungeons, mysteries, node-based
campaigns, raids, heists, conspiracies, social events, urbancrawls,
hexcrawls, and pointcrawls. With the secrets you’ve unlocked here,
there’s really no limit to the scenarios you can create and the games
you can play.
So you should design more scenarios, mastering the intricacies of
the various scenario structures.
As you’re running those scenarios for your players, take the time
to really master the extra credit. Get a feel for the rhythm of the
table. Check in with your players and get their feedback on how the
campaign is going, then use that feedback to keep improving.
Try to play in some games, too. Game mastering is fun, but it’s
only half of the experience! Sitting in a player’s chair will also teach
you a lot about the type of game master you want to be and the
types of experiences you want to create for your players.

Finally, start thinking about how you can create new scenario
structures and unlock even more adventures. How would you run:
A natural disaster like a tsunami or Pompeii?
An election campaign with the PCs as candidates?
An Edwardian household drama like Downton Abbey?
A coast-crawl inspired by the journeys of Hanno?
A football team playing a full competitive season?
For some of these you might be able to use or hack the scenario
structures you’ve already mastered, but for others you’ll likely need
to create a new structure suited to the task. The most exciting part
of that, is that each new scenario structure unlocks not just one
adventure, but—like mysteries and dungeons and heists—an endless
variety of new adventures.
Good gaming! I’ll see you at the table!

JUSTIN’S FAVORITE RPGs

UP

UNTIL NOW, statistically speaking, you’ve probably only
played one RPG. If you’re having a good time, that’s great! But the
day will likely come when you’ll want to try something different—a
different genre, a different focus, a different experience—and that’s
great, too. One of the best ways to challenge yourself as a game
master is by running and playing new games, bringing what you
discover back to your favorite games, and maybe finding a few new
favorites along the way.
Here are a dozen of my favorite games, in no particular order,
that you might want to check out, too.
Numenera (Monte Cook): A science-fantasy game set one billion
years into the future. Earth has seen eight megacivilizations rise and
fall, and a neo-Renaissance now picks through the ruins,
rediscovering what was lost.
Ars Magica (Jonathan Tweet & Mark Rein·Hagen): Everybody
plays the wizard! Your powerful magi have banded together to
found a covenant in Mythic Europe, a fantasy version of the
continent’s thirteenth century.
Pendragon (Greg Stafford): Step into the legends of King Arthur,
playing knights of Camelot in a campaign designed to span decades.
Technoir (Jeremy Keller): A cyberpunk game with a radically
inventive game system in which you change the world by using
Verbs to push Adjectives. Also features conspiracy-driven plot
mapping.
Blades in the Dark (John Harper): Everybody plays the rogue!
The players craft not only their characters, but also the criminal
crew they all belong to. Features mechanics specialized for carrying

out heists and other scores that are tightly integrated with
downtime development of the crew.
Night’s Black Agents (Kenneth Hite): A vampire spy thriller, in
which retired secret agents discover that vampires are real. After
creating your own unique vampire variant, very creative tools like
the Conspyramid empower the GM to run a vast, global conspiracy.
Eclipse Phase (Rob Boyle & Brian Cross): A transhuman kitchensink space opera set ten years after the Fall of Earth. With elements
ripped from the pages of cutting-edge science fiction, Eclipse Phase is
a multitude of games in one.
Call of Cthulhu (Sandy Petersen): Based on the horror fiction of
H. P. Lovecraft, the players take on the roles of investigators seeking
to unravel eldritch mysteries.
You might also enjoy these storytelling games, which are tabletop
narrative games similar to roleplaying games, but distinctly different
(and not all of which even have a GM):
The Quiet Year (Avery Alder): A map-based storytelling game in
which the players collaboratively create a postapocalyptic
civilization using prompts generated from a deck of playing cards.
Microscope (Ben Robbins): Explore an epic history entirely of
your own making, using the rules of the game to build an everexpanding, non-linear chronology.
Shock: Social Science Fiction (Joshua A. C. Newman): A game
intensely focused on the speculative in speculative fiction, in which
each player takes on the roles of both their Protagonist and also the
Antagonist for the player sitting to their right.
Ten Candles (Stephen Dewey): Ten days ago, the sun went out.
And then They came. The survivors have learned to stay in the light.
You play this game by candlelight, snuffing out one of the ten
candles at the end of each scene … until the last candle goes out.

created the modern roleplaying game. Gary
Gygax and Frank Mentzer taught me how to run a dungeon. Jennell
Jaquays is the ultimate guru when it comes to xandering the
dungeon. John Tynes (Three Days to Kill) taught me how to run a
raid. D. Vincent Baker (Apocalypse World) and John Harper (Blades

Scott McCloud, particularly his Understanding Comics, must also be
acknowledged.
