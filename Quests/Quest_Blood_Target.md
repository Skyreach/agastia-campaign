# Quest: The Blood Target

## Player Summary

[[Nikki]] (Subject #2), a tiefling with latent temporal bloodline powers, has been assigned a mysterious patron within the [[Decimate Project]]: [[Nona (Subject #9)]], a protective coordinator who oversees younger subjects. [[Nona (Subject #9)]] has given [[Nikki]] a secret personal goal separate from [[Professor Zero]]'s Codex mission: **locate and kill a specific blood target**.

The target's identity, location, and the reason for their death remain unclear, but [[Nona (Subject #9)]] has hinted this is connected to [[Nikki]]'s temporal bloodline and will unlock greater power.

## DM Notes

### Quest Design Philosophy

**Moral Ambiguity:**
- No clear right answer
- Both choices have consequences
- [[Nikki]]'s character defining moment
- Player agency paramount

**Mystery Layers:**
1. **Who** is the target? (Identity)
2. **Why** must they die? (Motive)
3. **What** happens after? (Consequence)
4. **Who** benefits? ([[Nona (Subject #9)]] or [[Professor Zero]]?)

**Character Focus:**
- [[Nikki]]'s personal arc
- Independence vs. loyalty
- Power vs. morality
- [[Decimate Project]] control vs. free will

### Pacing

**Slow Burn:**
- Introduced in Session 1
- Develops across multiple sessions
- Parallel to Codex quest
- Major milestone, not immediate

**Incremental Reveals:**
- [[Nona (Subject #9)]] provides hints periodically
- Temporal anomalies offer clues
- [[Nikki]]'s powers grow, revealing bloodline
- Investigation builds to confrontation

### Integration with Other Quests

**Codex Quest Connection:**
- Codex may contain temporal magic
- [[Nona (Subject #9)]] knows about both quests
- Codex could explain bloodline
- Temporal Falls relevant to both

**[[Manny]]'s Journey:**
- How does [[Manny]] react to [[Nikki]]'s side quest?
- Trust between them tested
- [[Manny]] may need to help with kill
- Shared [[Decimate Project]] rebellion?

**Family Quest ([[Il Drago Rosso]]):**
- [[Nikki]]'s family may know bloodline history
- Restaurant could be information source
- Family in danger if target is enemy?
- Tiefling heritage relevant to temporal magic?

5. **Mastered** (Late game): Full temporal mage

**Possible Abilities:**
