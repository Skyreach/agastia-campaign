---

## THE SITUATION (DM Eyes Only)

### What Actually Happened

**The Legitimate Shipment (5 Days Ago):**
- **The Augury** (Agastia's arcane research institution) commissioned 6 Starfall Anchors from Lord Zaos's Feywild vault
- **Purpose:** Project Threshold - defensive ward research using planar barrier artifacts
- **Confidential:** Merit Council classified shipment ("Research Materials - Class 7")
- **Value:** 30,000 gp research grant + diplomatic significance
- Shipment arrived at docks 5 days ago aboard _Moonwhisper_

**The Heist:**
1. Dock clerk **Harren Dockwise** (Geist's informant) tips Geist about valuable confidential cargo
2. Harren "misroutes" shipment to Warehouse 7, marks official records "damaged in transit - disposed"
3. **Geist's thugs** (not Geist personally) collect cargo from Warehouse 7, unbox it
4. Thugs find research papers, report to Geist
5. Geist contacts buyer: **"The Architect"** (Chaos Cult contact)
6. **4 Starfall Anchors** delivered to Chaos Cult safehouse (20,000 gp payment)
7. **Final 2 anchors** prepared for secondary buyer OR completing Cult's order
8. Smuggler transporting final 2 dies on road to Agastia (CRATE SCENE - Session 3 Day 1)

**The Conspiracy:**
- **Harren Dockwise** (Dock Clerk) - 10% cut (2,000 gp)
- **Inspector Geist** (Corrupt Inspector) - 50% cut (10,000 gp)
- **Kaelborn** (Dock Superintendent, Tier 5) - 40% cut (8,000 gp)

**Why It Works:**
- Looks like shipping error, not theft
- Geist never touches cargo (plausible deniability)
- Kaelborn blocks deeper investigations
- Victim (Augury) can't publicly complain about stolen secret artifacts
- Castle can't override Kaelborn without hard evidence

### The Starfall Anchors (What Players Learn)

**What They Are:**
- Feywild crystalline artifacts (18-inch pylons, purple cores, silver veins)
- Used to stabilize planar barriers between Material Plane and Feywild
- Extremely rare - Lord Zaos guards his vault carefully
- Research materials for defensive ward improvements

**Why They Matter:**
- **Augury:** Needs them for critical Project Threshold research
- **Chaos Cult:** Plans to use them for dimensional corruption ritual (weaken barriers, spread shadow)
- **Lord Zaos:** Diplomatic loan from his personal vault - demands return
- **Kyle:** Patron Lord Zaos involved (personal stakes)

**Current Status:**
- 4 anchors in Chaos Cult hands (Phase 1 of ritual started)
- 2 anchors missing (smuggler died during transport)
- Cult needs all 6 to complete Phase 2 (dimensional breach)

## THE REVELATIONS (What PCs Must Discover)

### REVELATION 1: Starfall Anchors are valuable Feywild research artifacts

**Clue 1D (Kex the Fence) - Black market assessment:**
- "Feywild artifacts worth fortune on black market."
- "Planar research tools especially valuable. Every faction wants them."
- "30,000 gold legitimate, double that illegal."

**Clue 1E (Crate Scene) - Feywild packing materials:**
