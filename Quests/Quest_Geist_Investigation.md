## Quest Stages

### Stage 1: Initial Lead (Session 3)
**Trigger:** Wounded smuggler encounter on road to [[Agastia]]
**Information Gained:** "[[Geist (Bandit Lieutenant)]]... Warehouse 7... Docks..."
**Next Steps:** Investigate [[Dock District]], talk to merchants, find witnesses

### Stage 2: Investigation (3-3-3-1 Web)
**Choose 3 Entry Nodes:**
- Find wounded smuggler's crate (coiled serpent symbol)
- Interview [[Mira Saltwind]] (documentary evidence)
- Locate [[Kex the Fence]] (operational intelligence)

**Each Node Leads to 3 Investigation Sites:**
- Warehouse 7 (physical evidence)
- [[Merit Council]] Records (official cover)
- Underground Market (network connections)

### Stage 3: Revelation
**All Paths Converge:**
- [[Geist (Bandit Lieutenant)]] is bandit lieutenant posing as inspector
- [[Kaelborn (Bandit Boss)]] is actual [[Merit Council]] official (Dock Superintendent)
- Extortion scheme uses legitimate authority as cover
- [[Bandit Network (Geist & Kaelborn)]] operates at multiple tier levels

**Critical Decision:**
- Expose [[Geist (Bandit Lieutenant)]] only (easier, but [[Kaelborn (Bandit Boss)]] escapes)
- Take down entire operation (harder, requires proof against Tier 5 official)

### Stage 4: Confrontation
**Option A: [[Geist (Bandit Lieutenant)]] Only**
- Raid Warehouse 7
- Combat encounter (Level 5-6 rogue + guards)
- Merchant testimony
- [[Kaelborn (Bandit Boss)]] cuts ties, survives

**Option B: Full Network**
- Gather proof against [[Kaelborn (Bandit Boss)]]
- Navigate [[Merit Council]] politics
- Expose corruption at Tier 5
- Potentially face both [[Geist (Bandit Lieutenant)]] and [[Kaelborn (Bandit Boss)]]

## DM Notes

### Quest Design Philosophy
**3-3-3-1 Revelation Structure:**
- 3 entry nodes (different approaches)
- Each entry leads to 3 investigation locations
- All 9 locations reveal pieces of 1 truth
- Players can solve with any 3-4 well-chosen nodes

**Flexibility:**
- Players can approach in any order
- Multiple solutions (combat, exposure, politics)
- Can stop at [[Geist (Bandit Lieutenant)]] or pursue [[Kaelborn (Bandit Boss)]]

### Difficulty Scaling

**Easy Mode (Level 2-3):**
- Focus on [[Geist (Bandit Lieutenant)]] only
- Straightforward investigation
- Combat at Warehouse 7
- Merchant testimony sufficient

**Hard Mode (Level 3-4):**
- Pursue [[Kaelborn (Bandit Boss)]]
- Navigate Merit politics
- Require ironclad proof
- Face political retaliation

**Very Hard (Level 4+):**
- Simultaneous confrontation
- [[Merit Council]] opposition
- Faction warfare consequences
- City-wide political upheaval

### Evidence Tracking

**Against [[Geist (Bandit Lieutenant)]]:**
- Ledger from [[Mira Saltwind]] (documentary)
- Testimony from merchants (witness)
- Smuggled goods at Warehouse 7 (physical)
- [[Kex the Fence]]'s intelligence (operational)

**Against [[Kaelborn (Bandit Boss)]]:**
- Link between [[Geist (Bandit Lieutenant)]] and [[Kaelborn (Bandit Boss)]] (harder to prove)
- Official records showing protection
- Witness testimony placing them together
- Evidence [[Kaelborn (Bandit Boss)]] knew about smuggling

### Consequences

**If [[Geist (Bandit Lieutenant)]] Escapes:**
- Retaliates against witnesses
- Flees to [[Kaelborn (Bandit Boss)]]
- Operation moves to new location
- Merchants in danger

**If [[Geist (Bandit Lieutenant)]] Exposed but [[Kaelborn (Bandit Boss)]] Survives:**
- [[Kaelborn (Bandit Boss)]] cuts ties publicly
- Claims ignorance of [[Geist (Bandit Lieutenant)]]'s corruption
- Maintains position, continues operation covertly
- New lieutenant recruited eventually

**If Both Defeated:**
- [[Dock District]] power vacuum
- Other factions move in
- [[Merit Council]] credibility crisis
- Party gains powerful enemies and allies

### Integration with Campaign

**Connection to Other Quests:**
- [[Steel Dragon]] investigation may overlap ([[Dock District]] location)
- [[Merit Council]] politics affect all quests
- [[Dispossessed]] faction gains if corruption exposed

**Long-term Impact:**
- Sets precedent for exposing corruption
- [[Merit Council]] becomes ally or enemy
- Merchant network becomes resource
- [[Dock District]] remains important location

### Session 2 & 3 Integration

- Day 1: Bloody crate encounter (Kyle's hook)
- Arrival: Job board introduction

- New power players in [[Dock District]]
- Merchant contacts provide future quests
- [[Merit Council]] reputation (positive or negative)
