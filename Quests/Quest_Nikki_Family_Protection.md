# Nikki Family Protection

## Player Summary

A job board posting in the [[Merchant District]] seeks discreet investigators to look into reports of aggressive business practices. Multiple establishments report intimidation tactics and demands for "protection money."

**Job Board Posting:**
> "WANTED: Discreet investigators to look into reports of aggressive business practices in [[Merchant District]]. Multiple establishments report intimidation tactics. Reward: 100gp + 10 Merit. Contact: [[Merit Council]] Inspector Crane."

When investigated, [[Nikki]]'s family restaurant [[Il Drago Rosso]] turns out to be one of the threatened establishments. Papa and Mama Biago are refusing to pay, putting their neutral ground status - and their family - at risk.

### Basic Information

- **Type:** Mission (Investigation & Social)
- **Status:** Available
- **Patron:** Inspector Crane ([[Merit Council]] official)
- **Reward:** 100gp + 10 Merit (Base), plus family rewards if [[Il Drago Rosso]] is protected

### Objectives

1. Investigate the extortion operation targeting [[Merchant District]] businesses
2. Discover who is behind the intimidation campaign
3. Protect [[Il Drago Rosso]] and the Biago family from threats
4. Stop the extortion operation (through confrontation, exposure, negotiation, or sabotage)

## Quest Structure

### Node 1: Initial Investigation

**Entry Points:**
- Accept job from Inspector Crane at job board
- [[Nikki]] hears from Papa/Mama about "new customers making demands"
- Other merchants in [[Merchant District]] mention the problem

**Investigation (Tiered DCs):**
- **Easy (DC 10 Investigation):** Identify pattern of affected businesses, all high-traffic locations
- **Moderate (DC 13 Persuasion):** Merchants describe enforcers - 2-4 thugs, faction symbols visible
- **Hard (DC 16 Insight):** True target isn't just money - they're focusing on information hubs and meeting places

**Outcomes:**
- Success: Identify affected businesses, get descriptions of enforcers, understand escalation pattern
- Failure: Miss warning signs, extortion escalates before party can act

### Node 2: Evidence Gathering

Party must gather proof of the extortion operation.

**Evidence Sources:**
- **Business Records:** Pattern of visits, escalating demands, veiled threats (DC 12 Investigation)
- **Witness Testimony:** Merchants describe tactics, faction affiliation (DC 14 Persuasion)
- **Physical Evidence:** Threatening notes, vandalism evidence, "accident" scenes (DC 15 Investigation)
- **Biago Intel:** Papa and Mama provide overheard conversations, patterns of behavior (automatic if party asks)

**Outcomes:**
- Success: Gather enough evidence to identify faction, locate enforcers, understand true motive
- Failure: Insufficient evidence, must confront enforcers directly without backup plan

### Node 3: Discovery - The True Motive

Through investigation, party discovers the truth:

**Revelations:**
1. **Faction Identity** - Specific faction behind extortion (DM chooses: [[Chaos Cult]], Criminal Syndicate, [[Merit Council]] Hardliners, or Rival Restaurant)
2. **True Goal** - Not just money, but control of [[Il Drago Rosso]]'s neutral ground status for intelligence gathering
3. **Inside Connection** - A corrupt [[Merit Council]] official is being paid to look the other way

**Outcomes:**
- Success: Understand full scope of threat, can plan appropriate response
- Failure: Miss deeper implications, may solve immediate threat but leave masterminds in place

### Node 4: Confrontation & Resolution

Party chooses their approach:

**Path A: Direct Confrontation**
- Track down enforcers (DC 14 Investigation or Survival)
- Combat or intimidation encounter (2-4 Thugs, CR 2-3 total)
- Follow trail to handler (DC 16 Insight or Intimidation)
- Force faction to back off through strength
- **Risk:** Escalates to open conflict, may damage [[Il Drago Rosso]]'s neutral status

**Path B: Investigation & Exposure**
- Present evidence to Inspector Crane (automatic if evidence gathered)
- Official crackdown on operation (Inspector organizes guard raid)
- Public exposure of corrupt official (if discovered)
- **Benefit:** Maintains neutrality, uses official channels, less violence

**Path C: Negotiate & Redirect**
- Identify faction's true needs (DC 17 Insight)
- Broker alternative solution (DC 18 Persuasion)
- Offer different intelligence source or meeting ground
- **Benefit:** No bloodshed, maintains all relationships, most complex

**Path D: Undermine & Sabotage**
- Infiltrate operation (DC 15 Deception or Stealth)
- Create internal problems (DC 16 Sleight of Hand or Deception)
- Make extortion unprofitable/dangerous for faction
- **Risk:** Requires deception, could backfire if discovered (DC 18 to avoid)

**Outcomes:**
- Success (any path): [[Il Drago Rosso]] protected, extortion operation stopped, party gains rewards
- Partial Success: Immediate threat resolved but deeper problems remain
- Failure: Biago family forced to comply or flee, neutral ground lost

## DM Notes

### Hidden Information

**The Corrupt Official:**
- [[Merit Council]] Inspector Voss is taking bribes (500gp per tenday)
- Will actively work against party investigation if they get close
- Can be exposed for bonus reward and story impact
- Inspector Crane is unaware and will be horrified when revealed

**The Real Mastermind:**
- Handler is mid-level operative, reports to faction leadership
- True goal: Eliminate neutral meeting grounds city-wide
- [[Il Drago Rosso]] is test case - if successful, expand to other locations
- Faction wants to force all negotiations through their controlled channels

**Biago Family Secret:**
- Mama Biago's people-reading is actually low-level divination magic
- She doesn't know it's supernatural - thinks everyone can tell lies
- This is why [[Il Drago Rosso]]'s neutral ground works so well
- If threatened severely, this ability might manifest more overtly

**Escalation Clock:**
- 8-segment clock, ticks every 2 days of inaction
- At 4 ticks: Vandalism escalates, staff threatened directly
- At 6 ticks: Violence - someone gets hurt (staff member beaten)
- At 8 ticks: [[Il Drago Rosso]] forced to close OR Biago family directly attacked

### Alternative Approaches

**Rival Faction Assistance:**
- Other factions value neutral ground, might help if approached
- Creates debt/obligation but solves immediate problem
- May start faction war if not handled delicately

**Underworld Connections:**
- Criminal contacts might know who's behind operation
- Could hire counter-enforcers to protect [[Il Drago Rosso]]
- Risks turning restaurant into faction territory

**Public Exposure:**
- Bring issue to public attention, force [[Merit Council]] to act
- Protects [[Il Drago Rosso]] but may anger powerful factions
- Mama and Papa prefer discrete solutions

**Relocation:**
- Offer to help Biagos relocate/fortify restaurant
- Quickest solution but loses established neutral ground
- Family will resist this option strenuously

### Consequences

**If [[Il Drago Rosso]] is Protected:**
- Party gains deep trust of Biago family (major intelligence asset)
- Permanent free meals, private room access, sanctuary when needed
- Mama's "readings" of NPCs available to party
- Other factions see party as protectors of neutral spaces
- Sets precedent: threatening neutral ground has consequences

**If [[Il Drago Rosso]] is Compromised:**
- Biago family forced to choose side or close
- Neutral meeting ground lost (hurts all future faction negotiations)
- [[Nikki]] loses safe haven and family support
- Faction gains intelligence advantage over rivals
- Other neutral locations become targets

**If Corrupt Official Exposed:**
- [[Merit Council]] internal investigation, shake-up in ranks
- Inspector Crane promoted, becomes valuable ally
- Party gains reputation for rooting out corruption
- Some Council members resent the exposure

**Path-Dependent Outcomes:**
- **Path A (Confrontation):** Reputation as enforcers, intimidation bonus, faction animosity
- **Path B (Exposure):** [[Merit Council]] contacts, legitimacy boost, bureaucratic allies
- **Path C (Negotiation):** Diplomatic reputation, faction gratitude, complex web of favors
- **Path D (Sabotage):** Underworld contacts, stealth reputation, faction doesn't know who hit them

**Faction Reactions:**
- Responsible faction: Grudge if exposed/defeated, respect if negotiated with
- Rival factions: Gratitude for preserving neutral ground
- [[Merit Council]]: Appreciation if handled officially, concern if too violent
- [[Nikki]]: Character development regarding family vs. duty

- [[Nikki]] - Personal quest deepens family relationships
- Faction Politics - Demonstrates importance of neutral spaces in city power dynamics
- [[Merit Council]] - Reveals corruption, creates allies or enemies in government
