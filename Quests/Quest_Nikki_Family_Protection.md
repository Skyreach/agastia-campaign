# Quest: Nikki Family Protection

## Overview

**Type:** Personal quest for [[Nikki]] | Investigation & Social
**Tier:** 4 ([[Merchant District]])
**Status:** Available (Job Board posting)
**Connection:** [[Nikki]]'s family restaurant [[Il Drago Rosso]] is being threatened

**Hook:** A job board posting requests help investigating an aggressive faction trying to strong-arm businesses in the [[Merchant District]]. When the party investigates, they discover [[Il Drago Rosso]] is one of the targeted establishments.

## Quest Hook

**Job Board Posting:**
> "WANTED: Discreet investigators to look into reports of aggressive business practices in [[Merchant District]]. Multiple establishments report intimidation tactics. Reward: 100gp + 10 Merit. Contact: [[Merit Council]] Inspector Crane."

**The Truth:**
- A new faction (or subfaction) is moving into the [[Merchant District]]
- They're using intimidation and extortion to establish control
- [[Il Drago Rosso]] is a prime target due to its neutral ground status and connections
- Papa and Mama Biago are refusing to pay "protection money"
- Their neutrality prevents them from fighting back directly

## Investigation Structure

### Clue Web (3-3-3-1 Pattern)

**Stage 1: Discovery (3 Entry Points)**
1. **Job Board Investigation** - Inspector Crane provides list of affected businesses
2. **Family Connection** - [[Nikki]] hears from Papa/Mama about "new customers making demands"
3. **Witness Reports** - Other [[Merchant District]] merchants mention the problem

**Stage 2: Evidence Gathering (3 Leads)**
1. **Business Records** - Pattern of visits, escalating demands, veiled threats
2. **Witness Testimony** - Merchants describe the enforcers (appearance, tactics, faction symbols)
3. **Physical Evidence** - Threatening notes, vandalism, "accidents" at non-compliant shops

**Stage 3: Revelations (3 Connections)**
1. **Faction Identity** - Discover which faction is behind the extortion
2. **True Motive** - Not just money - they want control of [[Il Drago Rosso]]'s neutral ground status
3. **Inside Connection** - Someone in the [[Merit Council]] is looking the other way

**Stage 4: Confrontation (The Truth)**
- The faction wants to eliminate neutral meeting grounds to prevent rival factions from communicating
- Controlling [[Il Drago Rosso]] gives them intelligence on all faction activities
- They're willing to hurt the Biago family to make an example

## Key NPCs

**Inspector Crane:**
- [[Merit Council]] official assigned to investigate
- Genuinely wants to help but lacks resources/authority
- Can provide official backing if party gathers evidence
- Unaware of the inside connection (not the corrupt official)

**The Enforcers:**
- 2-4 thugs making threats to businesses
- Working for a faction handler
- Know very little about the bigger picture
- Can be intimidated, bribed, or captured for information

**The Handler:**
- Mid-level faction operative running the extortion operation
- Knows the true goal (control neutral ground, gather intelligence)
- Reports to faction leadership
- Willing to negotiate if cornered, desperate if exposed

**Papa & Mama Biago:**
- Refusing to cooperate but worried for family and staff
- Will not abandon their neutrality even under pressure
- Trust [[Nikki]] and her companions to handle it
- Can provide intelligence on the enforcers (overheard conversations, patterns)

## Quest Paths

**Path A: Direct Confrontation**
- Track down enforcers, intimidate/fight them
- Follow trail to handler
- Force faction to back off through strength
- **Risk:** Escalates to open conflict, may damage [[Il Drago Rosso]]'s neutral status

**Path B: Investigation & Exposure**
- Gather evidence against the faction
- Present to Inspector Crane and [[Merit Council]]
- Official crackdown on the operation
- **Benefit:** Maintains neutrality, uses official channels, less violent

**Path C: Negotiate & Redirect**
- Identify what the faction really wants
- Offer alternative solution (different intelligence source, different meeting ground)
- Broker deal that protects [[Il Drago Rosso]]
- **Benefit:** No bloodshed, maintains all relationships, most complex

**Path D: Undermine & Sabotage**
- Infiltrate the faction operation
- Create internal problems (steal money, forge evidence of betrayal)
- Make the extortion operation unprofitable/dangerous for faction
- **Risk:** Requires deception, could backfire if discovered

## Rewards

**Base Rewards:**
- 100gp (from job board)
- 10 Merit points
- Inspector Crane's gratitude and future cooperation

**Family Rewards (if [[Il Drago Rosso]] protected):**
- Permanent free meals for the party
- Private room access at [[Il Drago Rosso]]
- Papa and Mama's deep trust (major intelligence asset)
- Safe haven/sanctuary when needed

**Bonus Rewards (path-dependent):**
- **Path A:** Reputation as faction enforcers, intimidation bonus
- **Path B:** [[Merit Council]] contacts, legitimacy boost
- **Path C:** Faction gratitude (from deal), diplomatic reputation
- **Path D:** Underworld contacts, stealth reputation

**Story Rewards:**
- Deepen relationship with [[Nikki]]'s family
- Access to [[Il Drago Rosso]] as information hub
- Protection of neutral ground (benefits all future faction negotiations)
- Mama's "readings" of NPCs (she'll tell party when someone is lying)

## Complications & Escalations

**Clock: Faction Patience (8 segments)**
- Tick every 2 days if no action taken
- At 4 ticks: Vandalism escalates, staff threatened
- At 6 ticks: Violence - someone gets hurt
- At 8 ticks: [[Il Drago Rosso]] forced to close OR Biago family attacked

**Complication: The Corrupt Official**
- A [[Merit Council]] official is taking bribes to ignore the extortion
- Will actively work against party investigation
- Can be exposed (bonus reward) or used as leverage

**Complication: Rival Factions**
- Other factions notice [[Il Drago Rosso]] is threatened
- Some may try to help (protect neutral ground)
- Others may see opportunity (take over themselves)
- Creates three-way conflict if not managed

**Complication: [[Nikki]]'s Personal Stakes**
- Emotions run high when family is threatened
- May push for more aggressive action than party prefers
- Mama and Papa worry about [[Nikki]] getting hurt
- Character development opportunity for [[Nikki]]
