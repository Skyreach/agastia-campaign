## 📋 ORIGINAL USER REQUEST

> Right, so we need to fill this void. Not every district will have appropriate facilities, but we need to know what's there. Why do people live there? How do they make a living? They're not just squalor rocks on the floor. Further, there will be overlap between stores of a similar front but between districts. The high-class armory must offer something that the lower cannot make. We should figure out the differences (not just appearances, but mechanical). Sadly, we're doing some cartesian work, which is why we need the todo list; we cannot ignore any. Not all districts need all services; but we're trying to make a real feeling world. Let's make the higher quality services more fantastical.
>
> Also, reading the Agastia page under City Districts, while I appreciate the 1-liner summary of each I would like even more to have toggles of each "service" (I'm including things the civilians of that area do on the day-to-day as a service) within that district.
>
> I also need to know what's in which tier, this can be districts but should also include important buildings, people, services, etc... From a tree hierarchy, Tier {Containing Districts & Buildings [Containing Stores (Containing NPCs)]}. This city is our hub! It should have a bit of everything - look at mentions within our other documents, like guilds, factions, key NPCs, session notes; and ensure it's all covered.
>
> There's a lot here! So a physical list is important! Start by capturing our intent as 1 step, then capture the items (be thorough), then capture what should go in each item; and descriptions will be last - these are all distict steps that block the order of operations. After we've captured our items, feel free to ask any questions. Include this prompt as part of the document!

## 🎯 PROJECT INTENT

### Core Goals

1. **Complete Vertical Structure (Tiers 1-7)**
   - Define what each tier represents (elevation, merit level, social class)
   - Establish why people live in each tier and how they survive
   - Ensure each tier feels lived-in and purposeful, not just "squalor"

2. **Create Living Districts**
   - Complete missing district files (Dock District, Lower Residential, The Depths, etc.)
   - Add service toggles to all district summaries showing daily life
   - Establish district personalities and economies

3. **Mechanical Service Differentiation**
   - Define actual mechanical differences between tier-based services
   - High-tier armory ≠ low-tier armory (not just prices and descriptions)
   - Higher tiers offer more fantastical/magical services
   - Lower tiers offer practical/mundane services

4. **Build Hierarchical Tree**
   - Structure: `Tier → Districts & Buildings → Stores → NPCs`
   - Clear understanding of "what lives where and why"
   - Comprehensive coverage - nothing forgotten

5. **Ensure Coverage**
   - Cross-reference all faction mentions, session notes, NPC files
   - Every mentioned guild/organization/location gets placed in the city
   - Create a "real feeling world" with interconnections

### Design Principles

- **Not Cartesian for Fun:** We're being thorough because completeness matters
- **Purposeful Placement:** Everything has a reason for being where it is
- **Economic Realism:** People need to make a living - show how
- **Mechanical Meaning:** Service differences matter in gameplay
- **Fantastical High-End:** Upper tiers have magical/extraordinary services
- **Overlap with Distinction:** Similar shops exist across tiers but offer different things

## 🏛️ TIER STRUCTURE DEFINITION (Completed 2025-12-13)

### Tier Hierarchy (1 = Highest, 7 = Lowest)

**Tier 1: The Castle**
- Most protected part of the city
- Merit Council's inner sanctum
- Highest security and prestige

**Tiers 2-3: Highest Merit Citizens**
- Split between two functional zones:
  - Research facilities & augury (magical/academic elite)
  - Noble residences (political/wealth elite)
- **Key Establishment:** High-caliber equipment shop
  - Selected: **Blades of Glory** (from Enchanting Emporiums)
  - Premium magic weapons/armor
  - Signature item: Blade of Glory (adaptable/shapeshifting sword - Very Rare, 25,000gp)
  - Features: Exclusive guild hall, master enchanters, highest quality craftsmanship

**Tier 4: The Masses' Ceiling**
- **Merchant District** - Commercial heart, trade, shops
- **Scholar Quarter** - Education, libraries, testing centers
- Highest tier average citizens can access without special circumstances
- Standard residential for "up-and-coming" citizens
- Some areas bleed into Tier 5 (sketchier sections)
- Theme: Earned merit, social mobility, aspiration

**Tier 5: Lower Merit / Transitional**
- **Lower Residential District** - Working class housing
- Overlap with Tier 4's seedier areas
- Citizens with lower merit status but still employed
- Theme: Honest work, modest living

**Tier 6: Lost Status (Recovering)**
- **Dock District** - Maritime workers, cargo handlers
- Those who've lost their merit status but still working
- Some recovering, seeking to regain status
- Theme: Fallen but fighting

**Tier 7: Lost Status (Given Up)**
- **The Depths** - Lowest level, underground
- The Dispossessed
- Those who've lost status and stopped trying to regain it
- Theme: Survival, desperation, black markets

### Key Design Principle
**Not many peasants in Agastia** - This is a meritocracy. Citizens either:
- Have earned their place (Tiers 1-4)
- Are working class maintaining status (Tier 5)
- Have fallen from status (Tiers 6-7)

But there's no "peasant underclass" - everyone had to prove merit to live here or fell from it.

## 👥 NPC TRACKING REQUIREMENTS

**Added:** 2025-12-14 (per user request)

For each NPC created in establishment files, we must track:

### Required NPC Information

**1. Faction Affiliation**
- Which faction do they represent or align with?
- Options: Merit Council, Chaos Cult, Dispossessed, Decimate Project, Merchant Guilds, None, Multiple
- Note if affiliation is secret or public knowledge

**2. Disposition Toward Faction**
- How do they feel about their affiliated faction?
- Options: Loyal, Conflicted, Using them, Being used, Secretly opposed, Genuinely aligned
- Include nuance - not all faction members are true believers

**3. Personal Goals & Interests**
- What does this NPC want?
- Both short-term (practical) and long-term (aspirational)
- What motivates their daily actions?
- What would make them take risks?

**4. Player Interaction Hooks**
- Would they ask players for help? Under what circumstances?
- Are they reluctant to involve outsiders, or eager for assistance?
- What could players offer them (besides money)?
- What information or resources could they provide players?

**5. Relationship Potential**
- Which party members might connect with this NPC?
- What shared interests, backgrounds, or goals exist?
- Potential for rivalry, friendship, mentorship, romance?
- How do their personalities mesh or clash with PCs?

### Implementation in Files

When creating NPC sections in establishment files, include:

```markdown
### [NPC Name]
**Role:** [Proprietor/Employee/Regular Customer/etc.]
**Faction:** [Faction name] (Disposition: [loyal/conflicted/etc.])

**Background:** [Brief history]

**Goals:**
- Short-term: [Immediate practical goal]
- Long-term: [Aspirational goal]

**Personality:** [Key traits, mannerisms]

**Interaction Hooks:**
- Would seek player help with: [Specific problems/needs]
- Reluctance level: [Eager/Willing/Reluctant/Desperate-only]
- Can offer players: [Resources, information, services]

**Party Connections:**
- Potential bonds with: [Specific PC names and why]
- Relationship type: [Ally/Rival/Mentor/Contact/etc.]
```

This ensures every NPC becomes a living character with agency and story potential, not just a service provider.
