## Conclusion

The Agastia campaign has **strong organizational coverage** in commercial (Merchant Guild) and religious (Grand Cathedral) sectors, with excellent detail for high-tier magical services (Blades of Glory) and underground/informal organizations (Dispossessed, smuggling networks).

**Critical gaps exist in educational and knowledge institutions** (Scholar Quarter), where all major organizations lack establishment files despite being central to the district's identity and campaign themes.

**Recommended priority:**
1. Create Scholar Quarter institutional files (Grand Academy, Testing Centers, Archives)
2. Establish magical professional guild (Magewright Consortium)
3. Document law enforcement organizations (Department of Investigation, City Watch)
4. Consider expansion of trade guilds (Craft Guilds)

This will provide complete organizational coverage across all tiers and ensure players have fully-realized institutions to interact with throughout the campaign.
