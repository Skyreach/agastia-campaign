## Notes for Future Development

**NPC Tracking Requirements (from user request):**
For each NPC in establishments, we need to track:
- Faction affiliation (which faction they represent)
- Disposition toward that faction (loyal, conflicted, using them, etc.)
- Goals and interests (what they want)
- Hooks for player interaction (would they ask for help? are they reluctant?)
- Relationship potential with party members

**Tier Assignment Rules:**
- Tier 1: Council-only access, highest security
- Tier 2-3: Invite-only or major achievement required
- Tier 4: Open to all with standard merit status
- Tier 5: Working class areas, merit maintained through employment
- Tier 6: Fallen but recovering, limited enforcement
- Tier 7: No merit status, minimal official presence

**Cross-District Connections:**
- The Undertow (smuggling tunnels): Connects Docks → Depths → Merchant District
- Sewer system: Runs through all tiers
- Service workers: Many Tier 5-6 residents work in higher tiers
- Information networks: Flow up and down through all levels
