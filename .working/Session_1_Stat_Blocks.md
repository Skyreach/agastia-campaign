**Nibble Essence (Recharge 6).** When the rat scores a critical hit, the target must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or lose one use of a minor class feature (such as Second Wind, Bardic Inspiration, or Ki Point). If the target has no such features, they instead take 3 (1d6) psychic damage.

### Tactics

**Amorphous.** The spawn can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

**Shadow Stealth.** While in dim light or darkness, the spawn can take the Hide action as a bonus action.

**Sunlight Weakness.** While in sunlight, the spawn has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.

### Actions

**Shadow Touch.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 4 (1d6 + 2) necrotic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or suffer power drain (see below).

**Power Drain.** When a creature fails its saving throw against Shadow Touch, choose one:
- The target loses one unexpended spell slot of the lowest level.
- The target loses one use of a racial or class feature (target's choice).
- If the target has no spell slots or limited-use features, they take 4 (1d4 + 2) additional necrotic damage.

**Shadow Convert.** When the spawn drains a spell slot, it regains hit points equal to 3 times the spell slot's level (minimum 3 hit points).

### Tactics (Tucker's Kobolds Style)

**Environmental Use:**
- Hide behind rubble and corruption pools
- Use walls and ceiling for unexpected attack angles
- Bonus action Hide in dim/dark areas
- Guard chokepoints between rooms

**Target Priority:**
1. Spellcasters first (drain spell slots)
2. Healers second (prevent recovery)
3. Classes with limited features (fighters, monks)
4. Martials last (fewer resources to drain)

**When Bloodied (below 5 HP):**
- Retreat into walls using Amorphous
- Hide and wait for opportunity attacks
- Use hit-and-run tactics

**Group Tactics (2 spawns):**
- One distracts from front
- One flanks from ceiling/walls
- Focus fire on single target
- Retreat if both bloodied
