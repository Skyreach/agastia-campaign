- Travel quests with obstacles and events
- **Use when:** Open-world exploration, player agency priority

**Dungeon Sessions:**
- Jaquaysing: Loops, multiple entrances, verticality, secrets
- Tucker's Kobolds: Intelligent ecology, creatures optimize space
- Can exist within linear OR branching sessions
- **Use when:** Confined location with exploration

## Node 1: Axe Investigation - SKILL CHALLENGE

**DM Confirmed:** This is a skill challenge, NOT a combat encounter.

**The Setup:**
- Storm cloud is trapped in/around the axe
- Cloud behaves like a compass pointing underground
- Party must discover the cloud is pointing to underground chamber
- Connection: Cloud indicates where Heartstone is buried

**Skill Challenge Structure:**

**Success Conditions:** 3 successes before 2 failures

**Possible Skill Checks (DC 12-14):**
1. **Arcana:** Understand the cloud's magical nature, recognize it as a pointer/compass
2. **Investigation:** Examine the axe's position relative to cloud direction
3. **Nature:** Read the storm cloud's behavior, understand it's not natural weather
4. **Perception:** Notice the cloud isn't moving randomly, has consistent direction
5. **Survival:** Track/navigate using the cloud as directional indicator

**Success:** Party realizes cloud points underground, discovers entrance to chamber beneath ruins
**Failure:** They find entrance eventually but trigger complications (dungeon alert, time loss, environmental hazard)

**Axe Discoveries:**
- Zhaask symbols on axe (draconic)
- Corruption seed visible (dark pulsing energy)
- Cannot move axe (too heavy, cursed)
- Storm cloud trapped/bound to it
- Cloud points toward underground

## Node 2: Underground Chamber - DUNGEON

**DM Confirmed:** Yes, underground dungeon beneath ruins. Shadow creatures driven by corruption.

**Entrance:** Discovered via cloud-compass pointing underground, or found through investigation

**Dungeon Theme:** Shadow creatures corrupted by axe's dark energy

**Shadow Creature Options (Level 1 appropriate):**

**Option 1: Shadow (CR 1/2) - Use Official Stat Block**
- **Original:** HP 16, AC 12, resists non-magical weapons, STR drain attack
- **Weakened Version for Level 1:** HP 10, AC 11, advantage on non-magical saves instead of resistance

**Option 2: Shadow-Touched Creatures (Reskinned)**
- **Shadow Rats:** Giant Rat stats (CR 1/8) + shadowy appearance, pack tactics
- **Shadow Bats:** Bat swarm stats (CR 1/4) + darkness aura (dim light in 10ft)
- **Quantity:** 3-6 rats OR 1-2 bat swarms
- **Ecology:** Nest in darkest corners, use verticality, retreat to narrow passages

**Option 3: Shadow Spawn (Homebrew - CR 1/4)**
- **Stats:** AC 12, HP 9 (2d8), Speed 40ft
- **Attack:** Shadow Touch +4, 1d6+2 necrotic damage

- **Room 3:** 1 Shadow or 2-3 Shadow Spawn (Heartstone guardian)

**DM CONFIRMED: Mix of Options 2 & 3 with resource drain mechanic**

**Shadow Creatures - Resource Draining Theme:**

**Shadow Spawn (Homebrew CR 1/4) - PRIMARY THREAT**
- **Stats:** AC 12, HP 9 (2d8), Speed 40ft
- **Attack:** Shadow Touch +4, 1d6+2 necrotic damage
- **Special - Power Drain:** On hit, target must make DC 12 WIS save or lose one of:
  - 1 spell slot (lowest level available)
  - 1 use of racial/class feature (player's choice which)
  - 1d4 temporary HP (if no other resources)
- **Shadow Convert:** Spawn regains HP equal to spell slot level drained
- **Ability:** Sunlight Sensitivity, Shadow Stealth (bonus hide in dim/dark)
- **Quantity:** 2-4 spawns total

**Shadow-Touched Rats (CR 1/8) - SECONDARY THREATS**
- **Base:** Giant Rat stats with shadowy appearance
- **Special - Nibble Essence:** On critical hit, drains 1 use of minor ability (like Second Wind, Healing Surge, Bardic Inspiration die)
- **Tactics:** Pack tactics, swarm isolated targets
- **Quantity:** 4-6 rats total

**Encounter Distribution (3-5 rooms):**
- **Room 1:** 3-4 Shadow Rats (warm-up, introduce drain mechanic)
- **Room 2:** 2 Shadow Spawn (serious threat, resource management test)
- **Room 3 (Heartstone chamber):** 1-2 Shadow Spawn + environmental hazard

**Resource Drain Tone:** Dark corruption literally feeds on PC power, forcing careful resource management and tactical withdrawal decisions.

**Dungeon Size:** 3-5 rooms recommended for level 1 party

**Tucker's Kobolds Tactics (Shadow Creatures):**
- Use darkness to advantage (hide, ambush)
- Attack from unexpected angles (walls, ceiling if incorporeal)
- Retreat to narrow passages party can't easily follow
- Guard Heartstone room, don't leave it undefended
- Use choke points and terrain knowledge

**Jaquaysing Elements Needed:**
- Multiple paths to Heartstone chamber
- At least one loop/alternate route
- Verticality (shaft, pit, elevated platform)
- Secret passage (optional escape route)

## Node 3: Axe Resolution - RAKASH EVENT

**DM Confirmed:** This is a scripted event where Rakash claims the axe.

**The Event:**
- After finding Heartstone, party returns to surface/axe
- Rakash approaches the axe
- [What happens? DM to detail]

**Questions for DM:**
1. **How does Rakash claim it?** (Touches it? Heartstone proximity? Ritual?)
2. **What's the immediate effect?**
   - Does corruption cleanse immediately?
   - Does axe shrink to usable size?
   - Does Heartstone need to touch axe?
   - Does Storm Bond activate?
3. **Is there danger/cost?**
   - Does Rakash take damage?
   - Does anyone resist/try to stop him?
   - Environmental reaction?
4. **What's the aftermath?**
   - Rakash now has giant's axe (transformed)
   - Storm cloud released/dissipates?
   - Reality warps fade?
   - Party can now leave safely?

**DM CONFIRMED: Heartstone cutscene triggers axe cleansing**

**The Heartstone Cutscene (After finding it in chamber):**

1. **Heartstone Animates:**
   - Purple crystalline heart begins shape-shifting
   - Transforms into animated form (what shape? Humanoid? Creature?)
   - Fey energy pulses visibly

2. **Feat Granting Sequence:**
   - Purple light explodes from Heartstone
   - Each PC sees vision of deepest desire
   - Feats manifest immediately
   - Light reclaims back into Heartstone
   - Evil laugh echoes through chamber

3. **Corruption Breaking:**
   - Heartstone's power reaches up through earth to axe above
   - Visible energy pulse travels from chamber → surface
   - Corruption seed in axe SHATTERS (dark energy dissipates)
   - Axe begins to transform/cleanse
   - Storm cloud released/dissipates

4. **Rakash Compulsion:**
   - Rakash feels overwhelming pull toward the axe
   - "You feel compelled to return to the giant's weapon"
   - Party emerges from underground
   - Rakash approaches the now-cleansed axe

**The Axe Claiming (Surface, after emerging):**
- Axe has transformed: corruption gone, bluish-silver gleaming
- Rakash touches it → axe shrinks to usable size for Medium creature
- Storm Bond ability activates (dormant but present)
- Rakash can now wield the giant's weapon
- Reality warps fade completely, Ratterdan stabilizes

**Questions for DM:**
- What shape does animated Heartstone take?
- Does Heartstone stay animated or go dormant after?
- Do PCs bring Heartstone with them or leave it?

## Node 4: Travel to Agastia

**DM Confirmed:** Long rest triggers travel encounter.

**Two Travel Paths:**

**Path A: Return to Nearby Town First (Long Rest Required)**

- Return to [which town? Meridian's Rest?]
- Long rest encounter happens here
- Then hire caravan to Agastia

**Path B: Direct to Agastia (No Long Rest)**
- Party pushes through without rest
- Arrives exhausted but no encounter
- Can rest in Agastia

**If Long Rest (Path A) - Encounter Options:**

**Option 1: Dream Sequence (No combat)**
- During long rest, PCs have visions
- Foreshadow campaign mysteries
- Connected to Heartstone/feats granted
- Character development opportunity

**Option 2: Night Attack (Light combat)**
- Bandits/creatures attack camp during watch
- 2-4 CR 1/8 creatures (bandits, wolves, etc.)
- Quick combat, tests watch rotation
- Opportunity for short rest afterward

**Option 3: Social Encounter at Inn**
- Meet NPC at inn/tavern during rest
- Foreshadow Agastia situation
- Information gathering opportunity
- Potential quest hook for Session 2

**DM CONFIRMED: Skip for now, ad-hoc at table. Town is Meridian's Rest.**

**Reminder for Session:**
- **Nearby town:** Meridian's Rest (if party needs to rest/resupply)
- **Travel encounters:** Ad-hoc based on party decisions
- **Long rest options:** Dream sequence, night attack, or social encounter at inn
- **Direct to Agastia:** Skip encounter, narrate travel
