Read this file first: /mnt/e/dnd/agastia-campaign/.working/AGASTIA_CITY_COMPLETION_PROJECT.md

This file contains the complete project scope, progress, and specifications for building out Agastia city (our campaign hub) with all 7 tiers, districts, services, and establishments.

CURRENT STATUS:
- Phase 1: Structure & Inventory (COMPLETE)
- Phase 2: Service Design (COMPLETE)
- Phase 3: Content Creation (READY TO START)

WHAT'S BEEN COMPLETED:
✅ Tier hierarchy defined (1-7, Castle to Depths)
✅ All districts mapped to tiers
✅ Service categories defined (13 types)
✅ Mechanical differences framework complete (Equipment, Healing, Magic, Food/Lodging)
✅ Blades of Glory selected as Tier 2-3 premium shop
✅ Comprehensive creation priority list (6 districts, 18+ establishments, 13 NPCs)

WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE:
See the file's "CREATION PRIORITY LIST" section for full details.

Priority items include:
- 6 district detail files (Castle, Research Quarter, Noble Quarter, Lower Residential, Dock, Depths)
- 18+ establishment files (Brightcoin Emergency Supplies, Delizioso Trattoria, Gilded Scale, etc.)
- 13 NPC files for mentioned characters
- Service variation shops across tiers (armories, temples, healers, etc.)

NEXT STEPS:
1. Read the project file thoroughly
2. Update the TodoWrite tool with current checklist from the file
3. Ask user which content to create first, OR
4. Begin creating Priority 1 establishments (user's choice)

IMPORTANT REMINDERS:
- Update BOTH TodoWrite tool AND the project file as tasks complete
- Follow the mechanical differences framework when creating services
- Use ENTITY_FORMAT_SPECS.md for proper file formatting
- Not many peasants in Agastia - it's a meritocracy (design principle)
