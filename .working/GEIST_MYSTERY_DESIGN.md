# Geist Investigation Mystery - Complete Design Document
**Purpose:** Preserve all design work for Session 3 Geist Investigation redesign
**Status:** In Progress - Implementing 3-3-3-1 mystery structure
**Date:** 2026-01-04

---

## 📋 PROJECT GOAL

Redesign Session 3 Geist Investigation to follow 3-3-3-1 mystery structure with proper clues, leads, and revelations.

**Original Problems:**
1. Elf ghost encounter missing from session flow
2. Wounded man muttering "Geist Investigation" doesn't work (should be dead)
3. Crate needs interesting smuggled content (not mundane goods)
4. Crate encounter moots other entry points (points straight to docks)
5. "Difficulty scaling" contaminates player agency
6. Quest document format unclear - needs mermaid diagrams showing clue flow

**Solution Approach:**
- Design fantastical Feywild artifacts (Starfall Anchors)
- Create 5 revelations with 3 clues each (15 total clues)
- Design 7 investigation locations with 4-5 clues each
- Build flexible 2-3 lead depth structure
- Add proactive clue failsafes
- Ensure confidential shipment, Geist uses thugs, plausible deniability

## 🎯 THE STARFALL ANCHORS (Smuggled Artifacts)

### What They Are
**Starfall Anchors** - Crystalline fragments from a Feywild star that fell centuries ago, forged into dual-purpose artifacts:
- **Primary function:** Planar barrier anchors (stabilize Material/Feywild boundary)
- **Dormant function:** Wish-granting prisms (suppressed when properly installed in Feywild)

### Physical Description
- 18-inch crystalline pylons, six-sided, tapering to points
- Deep purple core with silver veins that pulse with starlight
- Surface etched with flowing Sylvan script (True Names)
- Cold to touch, makes reality "shimmer" within 5ft
- Hum at frequency just below hearing

### What They're FOR (Focus for Clues)
- **Legitimate use:** Augury commissioned them for planar barrier research (Project Threshold)
- **Defensive research:** Studying how to improve Agastia's protective wards
- **Extremely rare:** Lord Zaos guards his vault carefully
- **Diplomatic loan:** Sensitive Feywild transaction
- **Confidential:** Merit Council keeps this secret (public doesn't know)

### The Confidential Shipment
- **Manifest listing:** "Research Materials - Class 7 Restricted" (vague, coded)
- **Actual contents:** 6 Starfall Anchors from Lord Zaos's vault
- **Declared value:** Not publicly listed (confidential)
- **True value:** 30,000 gp research grant + diplomatic significance
- **Consignee:** The Augury, Scholar Quarter, Arcane Research Division
- **Project name:** "Project Threshold - Defensive Ward Enhancement Study"

### Stakes (Session Scope - 1-2 Sessions)
- **Chaos Cult:** Wants anchors for dimensional corruption ritual (4 anchors already in their hands)
- **Legitimate research blocked:** Augury can't complete critical ward improvements
- **Political catastrophe:** If Castle finds out Augury lost Feywild diplomatic loan
- **Lord Zaos (Kyle's patron):** Furious, demands return, potential diplomatic incident
- **Immediate danger:** Cult has 4, needs final 2 to complete Phase 2 of ritual

---

## 🕵️ THE SITUATION (Who/How/Why/When/Where)

### WHO

**The Conspiracy:**
1. **Harren Dockwise** (Dock clerk) - 10% cut
   - Tips Geist about valuable shipments
   - "Accidentally" misroutes cargo
   - Creates paper trail of "shipping errors"

2. **Inspector Geist** (Corrupt inspector) - 50% cut
   - Never touches cargo personally (plausible deniability)
   - Sends thugs to collect from Warehouse 7
   - "Investigates" missing shipments, always rules "shipping error"
   - Contacts buyers, negotiates sales

3. **Kaelborn** (Dock Superintendent, Tier 5 official) - 40% cut
   - Provides political protection
   - Blocks deeper investigations
   - Approves all of Geist's case closures
   - Castle can't override without hard evidence

**The Buyers:**
- **"The Architect"** (Chaos Cult contact) - Bought 4 anchors for 20,000 gp
- **Unknown secondary buyer** - Final 2 anchors (in transit when smuggler died)

**The Victims:**
- **The Augury** - Waiting for research shipment that "never arrived"
- **Dead smuggler** (crate scene) - Transporting final 2 anchors, killed (shadow burns? Cult magic?)
- **Lord Zaos** - Feywild patron whose vault was robbed (via diplomatic loan)

### HOW (Geist's Method - Plausible Deniability)

**The Operation:**
1. Confidential shipment arrives at Agastia docks ("Research Materials - Class 7")
2. **Dock clerk Harren** (Geist's informant) tips Geist about valuable cargo
3. Harren "misroutes" shipment to Warehouse 7, marks official records as "damaged in transit - disposed per protocol"
4. **Geist's thugs** (not Geist personally) collect cargo from Warehouse 7
5. Thugs unbox anchors, find confidential research papers, report to Geist
6. Geist contacts buyers (never touches cargo himself)
7. Thugs distribute 4 anchors to Chaos Cult (The Architect)
8. Thugs prepare final 2 anchors for secondary buyer
9. Augury files complaint about missing shipment
10. Geist "investigates" and closes case in ONE day ("shipping error, no crime found")
11. Kaelborn ensures no deeper Merit Council investigation
12. Smuggler transporting final 2 anchors dies on road (THE CRATE SCENE - Session 3 Day 1)

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ No direct link to Geist (clerk made "mistake")
- ✅ Looks like shipping error, not theft
- ✅ Geist has plausible deniability ("I investigate theft, I don't commit it")
- ✅ Castle investigates, finds "incompetent clerk" not corrupt inspector
- ✅ Kaelborn's authority prevents deeper investigation
- ✅ Victim (Augury) can't publicly complain about stolen secret artifacts

### WHY

**Motivations:**
- **Harren:** 2,000 gp cut (more than year's salary)
- **Geist:** 10,000 gp cut + ongoing operation profits
- **Kaelborn:** 8,000 gp cut + Chaos Cult leverage/blackmail(?)
- **Chaos Cult:** Needs anchors for dimensional corruption ritual (weakening planar barriers)

### WHEN (Timeline)

- **5 days ago:** Shipment arrives, Harren tips Geist, cargo misrouted to W7
- **4 days ago:** Thugs unbox at Warehouse 7, discover research papers, contact buyers
- **3 days ago:** Negotiations with The Architect (Chaos Cult)
- **2 days ago:** 4 anchors delivered to Cult safehouse (20,000 gp payment)
- **Yesterday:** Final 2 anchors prepared for secondary buyer transport
- **TODAY (Session 3 Day 1):** Smuggler dies on road, party discovers crate scene

### WHERE (Key Locations)

**Entry Points (3):**
1. **Crate Scene** (Road to Agastia) - Dead smuggler, damaged crate, Feywild debris
2. **Mira Saltwind's Shop** (Merchant District) - Extorted merchant with evidence
3. **Kex the Fence** (The Depths, Underground Market) - Criminal with underworld intel

**Investigation Sites (4):**
1. **Warehouse 7** (Dock District, Bay 3) - Unboxing site, research papers, transaction records
2. **The Augury** (Scholar Quarter) - Legitimate buyer, frustrated researchers, technical expertise
3. **Merit Council Records Office** (Tier 4) - Official paperwork, pattern of corruption
4. **Chaos Cult Safehouse** (Location TBD) - 4 anchors, ritual prep, The Architect

- 47 complaints about missing cargo at docks
- Investigations assigned to Geist: 37 cases, 100% ruled "shipping error"
- All approved/closed by: Dock Superintendent Kaelborn
- Castle can't override without hard evidence (Kaelborn has dock jurisdiction)

### REVELATION 5: Anchors sold to Chaos Cult ("The Architect") and others
**Why this matters:** PCs need to know WHERE anchors went and WHAT's at stake

**Clue 5A (Warehouse 7):** Buyer correspondence
- Letter fragment: "The Architect requires all six crystalline units. 20,000 for four now, 10,000 for final two upon delivery to Saltwind Imports."

## 📐 USER'S MYSTERY DESIGN RULES (To Follow for Skill)

### Core Principles

**1. Fantasy Setting Requirement:**
- Make it fantastical and matter!
- Not mundane goods or low stakes
- Consequences if unchecked should be significant

**2. 3-Clue Rule:**
- Each conclusion needs 3 independent clues
- Each clue must be sufficient ALONE to reach conclusion
- No "combine 3 partial clues" design (that's 3 conclusions, not 1)
- Example BAD: "6ft tall" + "green sweater" + "gray hair" (only works if unique on ALL)
- Example GOOD: "Signed confession" OR "Witnessed act" OR "Unique tool at scene"

**3. No Red Herrings:**
- User says "overrated" - don't use them
- Focus on multiple paths to truth, not false paths

**4. Proactive Clues (Failsafe):**
- If players stuck, villain acts
- New crime scene (another victim, robbery)
- Retaliation (thugs sent after party)
- Clue delivered (matchbook, letter, witness comes forward)
- Something semantically appropriate to the mystery

**5. Two Clue Types:**
- **Revelations:** Answer who/what/why (solve the mystery)
- **Leads:** Point to next location (continue investigation)
- Both follow 3-clue rule but in different ways
- Early scenes may have only leads (no revelations yet)
- Deep investigation eventually reveals truth

**6. Player Agency:**
- No "difficulty scaling" that changes mystery based on level
- Players choose their own path
- Multiple solutions valid

### 3-3-3-1 Structure

**3 Entry Points:**
- Different triggers to start investigation
- Each viable on its own
- Don't let one entry point "moot" others

**3 Investigation Locations (minimum):**
- Each entry point should lead to ~3 investigation sites
- Locations can overlap between entries (interconnected web)
- Flexible: Can add more if players re-route

**3 Clues Per Location/Conclusion:**
- Minimum 3 clues per revelation
- 2 extras serve as backups if first doesn't survive players
- Additional clues reinforce suspicions (desirable)

**1 Final Revelation:**
- All paths converge to same truth
- Players can solve with any 3-4 well-chosen nodes

### Depth Gauge

**Ask: "How many successful leads should players follow?"**
- Typical: 2-3 leads before confrontation
- For Geist Investigation: 2-3 leads confirmed
- Don't short-circuit flow
- Forgive PC re-routing (can add leads if needed)

### Mystery Design Process

**Step 1: Understand the Situation**
- Who is the villain/culprit?
- How did they commit the crime?
- Why did they do it?
- When did it happen?
- Where did it occur?

**Step 2: Create Revelation List**
- List all conclusions PCs need to reach
- For each revelation, design 3 independent clues
- Each clue must support conclusion alone and in full

**Step 3: Create Location List**
- List all places PCs can investigate
- For each location, provide 4-5 clues
- Mix of revelations (solve mystery) and leads (next location)

**Step 4: Design Entry Points**
- 3 different ways to trigger investigation
- Each points to different starting locations
- Ensure balance (no single entry moots others)

**Step 5: Map Clue Flow**
- Create diagrams showing entry → investigation → revelation
- Verify redundancy (3+ clues per revelation)
- Check depth (2-3 leads to confrontation)
- Plan proactive clues if players stuck

**Step 6: Test Flexibility**
- Can players reach truth via different paths?
- Does mystery work if they skip locations?
- Are there enough leads to keep investigating?
- Failsafes in place if stuck?

**If context runs out and new thread must continue:**

1. **Read this file first:** `.working/GEIST_MYSTERY_DESIGN.md`
2. **Check progress:** `.working/TODO_SESSION.md`
3. **Key files to modify:**
   - `Sessions/Session_3_The_Steel_Dragon_Begins.md` (lines 61-76 crate, lines 14-28 flowchart)
   - `Quests/Quest_Geist_Investigation.md` (complete rewrite)
   - `.claude/skills/mystery.md` (create new)

4. **Critical details:**
   - Starfall Anchors = Feywild barrier stabilizers, confidential shipment to Augury
   - Geist uses dock clerk Harren + thugs for plausible deniability
   - 5 revelations, 7 locations, 2-3 lead depth
   - Follow user's numbered rules (3-clue rule, no red herrings, proactive failsafes)

5. **User priorities:**
   - Session 3 first, then Quest document, then Mystery skill
   - Mystery skill uses this Geist Investigation as example
   - Track everything in working files for continuity
