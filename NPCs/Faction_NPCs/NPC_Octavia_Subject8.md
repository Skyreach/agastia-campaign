## DM Notes - RATTERDAN MASTERMIND

**SECRET ROLE:** Octavia hired the storm giant to destroy Ratterdan

**Motive:** Heartstone buried beneath Ratterdan (fey artifact for power boost)

**Method:** Used warlock connections to manipulate giant

**Current Status:** Tracking party to recover Heartstone (Session 1 villain behind the scenes)

**Warlock Patron:** Entity that wanted the Heartstone awakened

May betray Professor Zero if it serves her patron's goals

**Warlock Patron Options:**
- Fey entity connected to Heartstone
- Archfey who imprisoned the artifact
- Professor Zero themselves (hidden patron)
- Unknown patron manipulating entire Project

**Drow Implications:**
- Kidnapped from Underdark or surface?
- Underground network access
- Connection to Josh's lost people plot?
- Drow family/house may be searching

**Plot Hooks:**
- **First Decimate subject party encounters** (Session 1 or shortly after)
- Could be ally or antagonist for Heartstone
- Warlock patron's agenda conflicts with Zero
- May recognize Josh's markings from Underdark lore
- Potential boss fight or uneasy alliance

**Session 1 Integration:** Party recovers Heartstone, Octavia wants it. Conflict or negotiation opportunity.

**Loyalty Status:** QUESTIONABLE - serves patron first, Zero second, own agenda always
