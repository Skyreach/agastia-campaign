# The Patron (NEEDS SELECTION)

## Player Summary

**The Patron** is the mysterious individual who brings the party together on a caravan to investigate Ratterdan's destruction. They grant the party bonus feats and seem to know more about the giant's axe and the larger pattern of events than they initially reveal. Their true nature, motivations, and connection to the campaign's mysteries remain to be determined.

### Basic Information

- **Special Ability:** Grants bonus feats to party

## Three Patron Options

#### Personality
- Scholarly and analytical
- Sees connections others miss

### Option 2: The Custodian of Consequences

#### Concept
An enigmatic figure who appears mortal but references events from centuries past. Claims the giant's axe "bleeds reality" and must be contained before it causes catastrophic temporal damage. Speaks with authority about cosmic consequences.

#### Personality
- Cryptic but direct when necessary
- References past ages casually
- Concerned with "what must be" vs "what should be"
- Weary from long duty

"Temporal echoes" - grants feats as fragments of potential futures the PCs might achieve

#### Knowledge & Secrets
- Knows giant's axe is causing reality wounds
- Hints that Josh's people faced similar temporal threat
- May be outside normal time (unchanging, immortal, or time-looped)
- Possibly connected to higher planes or cosmic forces

#### Campaign Role
- Warning system for reality-threatening events
- Guardian of temporal/planar integrity
- May oppose Professor Zero if Codex threatens reality
- Potential final battle ally against cosmic threats

### Option 3: The Gambling Fate-Broker

#### Concept
A cheerful, almost whimsical figure who deals in possibilities and probabilities. Lost a bet and now needs the party to retrieve the axe. Makes everything feel like a game, but the stakes are deadly serious. Has uncanny knowledge of everyone's goals and desires.

#### Personality
- Jovial and friendly, but unsettling
- Treats serious matters as games or wagers
- Always seems to know more than they should
- Offers deals and bargains freely

#### Feat Granting Method
"Borrowed luck" - feats are pieces of fortune the PCs can cash in

#### Knowledge & Secrets
- Has information on everyone's personal goals (Codex, bandits, giant, markings, lost people)
- Lost bet to unknown entity (possibly Steel Dragon, Professor Zero, or cosmic force)
- May be fey, devil, celestial, or unique entity
- Knows fate threads and probability lines

#### Campaign Role
- Wild card ally who appears when convenient
- May offer Faustian bargains
- Could be helpful or manipulative (or both)
- Final reveal: was testing party or needed them to change fate
