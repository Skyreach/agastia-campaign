### Possible True Identities

3. **Construct/Golem:** Not even humanoid
4. **Collective:** "Professor Zero" is multiple people
5. **Dragon in Disguise:** Connection to Niletrix
6. **Former Decimate Subject:** Grew up and took over
7. **Chaos Cult Member:** Connected to larger conspiracy

### True Goals (Options)
1. **Codex Contains Decimate Formula:** Wants to perfect the process
2. **World-Changing Knowledge:** Codex power for noble/evil purpose
3. **Personal Immortality:** Decimate subjects are backup bodies
4. **Army Creation:** Building super-soldier program

### Future Hooks
- Manny/Nikki discovering truth about their pasts
- Meeting other Decimate siblings
- Laboratory discovery in Keth
- Professor Zero's true identity revelation
- Codex actually found (what happens then?)
- Loyalty crisis among subjects
- Professor Zero's backup plans
- Connection to main campaign plot (Steel Dragon, Chaos Cult, etc.)

### Character Development Notes
- Can be sympathetic (good intentions) or purely evil
- Memory wipes might be reversible
- Each subject has tragic pre-capture story
- Nona's protective role suggests some subjects retain humanity
- "Zero" name significant? Tenth experiment? Reset point?

### Combat Considerations
- Likely avoids direct confrontation
- Uses Decimate subjects as proxies
- May have powerful magic/artifacts
- Hidden laboratory is fortress
- Backup plans within backup plans
- Final confrontation should be high-level (tier 3-4)

### Campaign Integration
- **Codex Quest:** Central to Manny/Nikki arc
- **Rakash Connection:** Through Niletrix (unexplored)
- **Beholder Link:** Collaborates sometimes - why?
- **Keth Location:** Hidden lab could be dungeon
- **Memory Magic:** Could tie to Steel Dragon, Chaos Cult
- **Final Villain?:** Could be endgame BBEG or red herring

### Session Hooks
- Letters/messages to Manny and Nikki
- Reports on Codex progress demanded
- Other Decimate subjects encountered
- Clues to identity in various locations
- NPCs who recognize Decimate subjects
- Parents of kidnapped children searching

### Moral Complexity Options
- **Gray:** Preventing apocalypse through terrible means
- **Tragic:** Was once good, corrupted by necessity
- **Evil:** Pure megalomaniac experimenting on children
- **Controlled:** Possessed or blackmailed into running Decimate
- **Justified:** Codex contains cure for major threat
