### True Goals (Options)

2. **World-Changing Knowledge:** Codex power for noble/evil purpose
3. **Personal Immortality:** Decimate subjects are backup bodies
4. **Army Creation:** Building super-soldier program

### Future Hooks
- [[Manny]]/[[Nikki]] discovering truth about their pasts
- Meeting other Decimate siblings

- [[Professor Zero]]'s true identity revelation
- Codex actually found (what happens then?)
- Loyalty crisis among subjects
- [[Professor Zero]]'s backup plans
- Connection to main campaign plot ([[Steel Dragon]], [[Chaos Cult]], etc.)

### Character Development Notes
- Can be sympathetic (good intentions) or purely evil
- Memory wipes might be reversible
- Each subject has tragic pre-capture story
- Nona's protective role suggests some subjects retain humanity
- "Zero" name significant? Tenth experiment? Reset point?

### Combat Considerations
- Likely avoids direct confrontation
- Uses Decimate subjects as proxies
- May have powerful magic/artifacts
- Hidden laboratory is fortress
- Backup plans within backup plans
- Final confrontation should be high-level (tier 3-4)

### Campaign Integration
- **Codex Quest:** Central to [[Manny]]/[[Nikki]] arc
- **Rakash Connection:** Through Niletrix (unexplored)
- **Beholder Link:** Collaborates sometimes - why?
- **Keth Location:** Hidden lab could be dungeon
- **Memory Magic:** Could tie to [[Steel Dragon]], [[Chaos Cult]]
- **Final Villain?:** Could be endgame BBEG or red herring

### Session Hooks
- Letters/messages to [[Manny]] and [[Nikki]]
- Reports on Codex progress demanded
- Other Decimate subjects encountered
- Clues to identity in various locations
- NPCs who recognize Decimate subjects
- Parents of kidnapped children searching

### Moral Complexity Options
- **Gray:** Preventing apocalypse through terrible means
- **Tragic:** Was once good, corrupted by necessity
- **Evil:** Pure megalomaniac experimenting on children
- **Controlled:** Possessed or blackmailed into running Decimate
- **Justified:** Codex contains cure for major threat
