## [[Octavia (Subject #8)]]'s Manipulation

### The Corruption
**Background:**
- Krythak was once noble storm giant (Lawful Good)
- Valued order, justice, protection of weak
- Became disillusioned with "chaos" of humanoid societies

**[[Octavia (Subject #8)]]'s Approach (Subject #8):**
- Posed as philosophical advisor/ally
- Convinced Krythak that "order through strength" is necessary
- Manipulated his desire for justice into tyrannical control
- Provided magical support and tactical advice
- Uses him as tool for [[Decimate Project]] goals

**Current Belief:**
- Krythak believes he's building "perfect ordered society"
- Conquest is "necessary evil" to establish lasting peace
- Slaves will be "elevated" through discipline and order
- Weak and chaotic must be ruled by strong and orderly
- Genuinely thinks he's the hero

### [[Octavia (Subject #8)]]'s Goals
**Using Krythak to:**
- Destabilize [[Merit Council]] coastal holdings
- Create chaos for [[Decimate Project]] experiments
- Test warband tactics for larger operations
- Gather resources and intelligence
- Distract authorities from other Decimate activities

**Relationship:**
- [[Octavia (Subject #8)]] visits camp periodically
- Provides magical aid and strategic counsel
- Krythak doesn't know about [[Decimate Project]]
- Believes [[Octavia (Subject #8)]] is fellow visionary
- Would be devastated to learn he's being used

## Connection to [[Ian/Rakash]]

### The Giant's Axe
**Krythak's Weapon:**
- Giant's axe that Ian seeks
- Belonged to different giant originally
- Krythak took it as trophy from defeated rival
- Uses greatsword personally, axe is decoration/symbol

**Location:**
- Displayed in Krythak's command post
- Symbol of conquest and strength
- Guarded with rest of war camp

### Ian's Quest
**The Challenge:**
- Axe is in heavily fortified position
- Can't be stolen easily (guards, magical wards)
- Can't be taken by solo assault (suicidal)
- Requires planning, allies, or clever approach

**Potential Approaches:**
1. **Military Assault:** Gather army, attack war camp (high casualties)
2. **Stealth Mission:** Infiltrate, steal axe (very difficult)
3. **Mercenary Allies:** Hire experienced adventurers
4. **[[Merit Council]] Support:** Official military operation
5. **Diplomatic Challenge:** Duel Krythak for axe (likely death)
6. **[[Octavia (Subject #8)]] Route:** Discover manipulation, turn Krythak

## DM Notes

### Krythak's Role
- **Major Villain:** End-game boss for Ian's personal quest
- **[[Octavia (Subject #8)]] Tool:** Demonstrates [[Decimate Project]] manipulation
- **Moral Complexity:** Corrupted hero, not pure evil
- **Military Challenge:** Requires party to think strategically

### Redemption Possibility
**If Party Exposes [[Octavia (Subject #8)]]'s Manipulation:**
- Krythak could be redeemed
- Would turn against [[Octavia (Subject #8)]]
- Might release slaves, disband warband
- Could become ally against [[Decimate Project]]
- Requires proof and persuasion (very difficult)

**Warning:**
- Redemption arc is OPTIONAL
- Party might just want to kill him (valid)
- Redeemed Krythak still faces justice for raids
- Some victims won't forgive regardless

### Ian's Character Arc
**Options:**
1. **Revenge:** Kill Krythak, take axe (simple but satisfying)
2. **Justice:** Capture Krythak, bring to trial (difficult)
3. **Redemption:** Redeem Krythak, he gives axe freely (complex)
4. **Theft:** Steal axe without confronting Krythak (clever)

**Each approach develops Ian differently**

### Warband Encounter Design
**Not Meant for Early Campaign:**
- Level 2-4: Gather intel, scout, prepare
- Level 5-7: Small skirmish encounters with raiding parties
- Level 8-10: Assault on war camp with allies
- Level 11+: Direct confrontation with Krythak

**Scaling Options:**
- Early: Party investigates rumors, gathers intelligence
- Mid: Party disrupts raids, rescues slaves
- Late: Full assault on Lonely Mountain base

### [[Octavia (Subject #8)]]'s Involvement
**If Party Attacks War Camp:**
- [[Octavia (Subject #8)]] may appear to defend her "investment"
- Provides magical support to Krythak
- Escapes if battle turns against her
- Abandons Krythak if he's clearly losing (pragmatic)

**If Exposed:**
- Denies manipulation claim
- Tries to assassinate party to protect secret
- May trigger Krythak's realization if proof shown

### Lonely Mountain Location
**Geography:**
- Visible from coastal settlements
- Multi-day journey from [[Agastia]]
- Difficult mountainous terrain
- Limited approach routes (tactical advantage)

**Regional Impact:**
- Coastal trade disrupted
- Villages abandoned or fortified
- [[Merit Council]] bounty posted (500gp for information)
- Military hesitant to commit (high casualties expected)

### Future Hooks
- Surviving raiders provide intel
- Rescued slaves have camp information
- [[Octavia (Subject #8)]]'s involvement hints at larger plot
- Giant's axe may have additional significance
- Other [[Decimate Project]] subjects may have similar tools

### Connection to Campaign
- Demonstrates [[Decimate Project]] reach
- Shows [[Octavia (Subject #8)]]'s manipulation abilities
- Provides military/tactical challenge
- Connects to [[Merit Council]] regional politics
- Personal quest for Ian's character development
