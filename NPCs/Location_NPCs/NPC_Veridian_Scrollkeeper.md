## Relationships

### Colleagues
- **[[Mirella Stonemark]]:** Philosophical disagreement (he preserves, she profits); professional respect but different values

### Employers
- **[[Archive of Lost Histories]]:** Employed as senior researcher and archivist

### Potential Connections
- **[[Manny]]:** Will become mentor figure if [[Manny]] shares discoveries
- **[[Professor Zero]]:** May know of him through academic circles (not confirmed)

## How to Find Him

### Location
**[[Archive of Lost Histories]]** ([[Scholar Quarter]], Tier 3)
- Small, specialized library focusing on pre-Council artifacts
- Not widely known outside academic circles
- Open during standard hours (8am - 6pm, every day)
- Veridian practically lives there

### Methods
**DC 12 Investigation in [[Scholar Quarter]]:**
- Ask at any library about "artifact experts"
- Scholars recognize the name when artifacts are mentioned
- "Oh, you want Veridian - he's at the [[Archive of Lost Histories]]"

**Torvin's Recommendation:**
- If party asks Torvin about artifact scholars
- "Veridian Scrollkeeper - old as dirt, knows twice as much"
- Provides Archive location

**[[Professor Zero]] Connection:**
- [[Professor Zero]] may have mentioned Veridian in passing
- Academic circles all know each other

## Interaction with [[Manny]]

### Initial Meeting
When [[Manny]] asks about the Codex:

> Veridian's eyes light up behind his spectacles. He sets down his current book with a soft thump.
>
> "Ah, the Dominion Evolution Codex! A fascinating legend. Seven metal pages, bound to stone, supposedly capable of enforcing peace itself."
>
> He starts pulling books from shelves even as he talks.
>
> "The old texts say it was placed in a sanctuary where time flows... strangely. Healing waters, if the stories are true. Look for the Temporal Bloodline—they were the guardians, last I heard."

### Follow-Up Questions
**"Where is this sanctuary?"**
- "The texts don't give specifics - ancient authors loved their vagueness."
- "Underdark, certainly. References to stone and water, echoing chambers."
- "One fragment mentioned 'where tears of stone weep endlessly' - a waterfall, perhaps?"

**"Who are the Temporal Bloodline?"**
- "Tribe with innate temporal magic - very rare."
- "Can sense distortions in time, sometimes manipulate it minutely."
- "Reclusive. Haven't been seen on surface in... oh, century or more?"
- "If anyone knows the Codex's exact location, it's them."

**"How do I find them?"**
- "That's the trick, isn't it? They find you, usually."
- "Stories say they appear near temporal anomalies."
- "Places where time flows wrongly - faster, slower, backwards."
- "If you're searching for the Codex, they may seek you out."

### Payment
**FREE - No charge**
- Veridian loves sharing knowledge
- Seeing a young person interested in ancient lore delights him
- May gift [[Manny]] a reference copy of relevant text
- "Just promise to tell me what you find!"
