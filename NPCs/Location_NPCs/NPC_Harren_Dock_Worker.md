**Location:** The Rusty Anchor, dock district (Tier 6)
- Seedy tavern frequented by dock workers
- Harren is there most evenings after work
- Known locally, easy to identify

**Approach:**
- Asking about "dock inspections" or "corruption" gets attention
- Mentioning Geist's name makes him wary
- Casual conversation about dock work builds trust

### Getting Information
**Persuasion DC 10** (easy - first clue should be accessible)

**Buy him 1-2 drinks (2gp):**
Makes him more talkative, lowers DC to 8

**What He Shares:**
> Harren glances around, then leans in close.
>
> "Inspector Geist? Yeah, I seen him. Takes 'fees' from smugglers right there on the docks. Bold as brass."
>
> He takes a long drink.
>
> "Warehouse 7, down by Pier District—that's where he does his real business. Got the Council badge, so nobody touches him. Protected, you know?"

### Follow-Up Questions
**"Where exactly is Warehouse 7?"**
- Provides specific directions to Pier District
- "Look for the Merit Council seal on the door - that's the cover"
- "Evening's when things happen. Shipments come in after dark."

**"Who does he work for?"**
- Shrugs. "Don't know, don't want to know."
- "Someone with power, that's for sure."

**"Will you testify?"**
- "Against a Merit Council inspector? Are you mad?"
- Won't go on record, too dangerous
- Can point others to witness, though
