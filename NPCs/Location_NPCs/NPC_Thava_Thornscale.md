A gruff but compassionate mid-ranking official, Thava has built a career through steady contributions over two decades.

- **Work Ethic:** Dedicated to preserving dangerous knowledge safely

## [[Merit Council]] Position

### Role: Senior Coordinator
**Department:** Office of Artifact Preservation
- Coordinates recovery and containment of dangerous artifacts
- Liaises with Keeper's Sanctuary and other neutral preservation factions
- Advises [[Merit Council]] on artifact-related threats
- Reports to Director of Artifact Safety

**Merit Ranking:**
- Mid-tier position earned through 20+ years consistent service
- Not wealthy or politically powerful, but well-respected
- Steady contributions valued more than flashy achievements
- Access exceeds rank due to network of professional relationships

### Network & Connections

- Access to restricted archives and sealed collections

- Temporary authorization letters for city resources
- Safe storage for recovered dangerous items

**Why People Help Him:**
- Two decades of professional relationships
- Known for keeping his word
- Has helped countless scholars and field agents
- [[Merit Council]] backing for legitimate requests
- Reputation for discretion and competence

## Connection to Party

### How He Knows About Them
- [[Torvin Greycask]]'s letter of introduction (carries weight)
- [[Merit Council]] intelligence reports mention Ratterdan incident
- Heard rumors of unusual crystalline companion
- Professional curiosity about Heartstone transformation

### Initial Reaction: Suspicious (Rolled 6)
**First Impression:**
- Wary of adventurers claiming to have dealt with Ratterdan shadows
- Torvin's letter prevents outright dismissal, but doesn't guarantee trust
- Needs convincing that they're competent and discreet
- Will test their knowledge and intentions before full cooperation

**What Earns His Trust:**
- Professional conduct and respect for artifacts
- Understanding the danger of what they're dealing with
- Willingness to follow proper containment procedures
- Protecting innocent bystanders over profit

### The Heartstone Recognition
**Why He Knows What It Is:**
- 20+ years cataloging and studying dangerous artifacts
- Office of Artifact Preservation maintains extensive Feywild artifact records
- Personally handled similar animation-magic items (none this powerful)
- Recognizes the specific crystalline transformation signature

**His Reaction:**
- Sharp intake of breath when he sees Bloody
- "That's... that's a Heartstone. Transformed. How in the Nine Hells did you—"
- Immediately concerned about who else might want it
- Warns them about keeping it quiet (collectors, cults, worse)
- Respects that they haven't weaponized or sold it

## Role in Session 2

### The Situation
**Problem at Keeper's Sanctuary:**
- Temporal disturbances threatening artifact containment
- Keepers requested outside assistance ([[Merit Council]] involvement too heavy-handed)
- Office of Artifact Preservation has standing relationship with Keepers
- Thava authorized to hire independent contractors for discrete investigation

### Why He's Hiring Outsiders
- [[Merit Council]] official investigation would be bureaucratic and slow
- Keepers trust Office of Artifact Preservation, not enforcement
- Temporal anomalies require fast response
- Thava prefers competent field agents over political appointees
- Party's Ratterdan experience shows they can handle dangerous situations

### What He Offers
**Payment Structure:**
- 50 gp upfront (city discretionary fund)
- 150 gp upon completion and report
- Lodging covered during investigation (The Scholar's Rest inn)
- Access to Office archives if they need research support
- **Total:** 200 gp + expenses

**Resources Provided:**
- Letter of authorization to Keeper's Sanctuary
- Emergency contact seal (summon city guard if situation escalates)
- Access to artifact safety equipment if needed
- His personal expertise on dangerous items

### What He Needs From Them
- Investigate source of temporal disturbances at Keeper's Sanctuary
- Ensure contained artifacts remain secure
- Report findings to him and the Keepers
- **Discretion:** No public panic, no bragging in taverns
- Professional conduct (Keepers are scholars, not soldiers)

### About the Heartstone

- Advises party to register it with Office (protective custody option)
- Warns that concealing powerful artifacts can backfire

### About Temporal Magic
- Office has cataloged temporal artifacts before
- All are extremely dangerous and unstable

### What He Doesn't Know
- [[Professor Zero]]'s identity or [[Decimate Project]] existence
- [[Steel Dragon]]'s human form identity
- Octavia's role in Ratterdan destruction
- Full nature of the Codex (knows Sanctuary guards something major)
- That [[Manny]] and [[Nikki]] are on mission to steal the Codex

## Personality Traits

- Rising through Merit ranks if party's successes reflect well

## Combat Considerations

**If Combat Occurs:**
- **Non-combatant preference:** Avoids fights when possible
- **Bronze Dragonborn heritage:** Lightning breath weapon (last resort)
- **Artifact knowledge:** Knows how to activate defensive magical items
- **City connections:** Can summon [[Merit Council]] guards quickly
- **Escape priority:** Protects artifacts first, fights second

**Stats (If Needed - CR 2 equivalent):**
