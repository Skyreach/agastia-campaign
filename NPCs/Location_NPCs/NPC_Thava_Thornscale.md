## Merit Council Position

### Role: Senior Coordinator
**Department:** Office of Artifact Preservation

- Liaises with Keeper's Sanctuary and other neutral preservation factions
- Advises Merit Council on artifact-related threats
- Reports to Director of Artifact Safety

**Merit Ranking:**
- Mid-tier position earned through 20+ years consistent service

- Known for keeping his word
- Has helped countless scholars and field agents

## Connection to Party

### How He Knows About Them
- Torvin Greycask's letter of introduction (carries weight)
- Merit Council intelligence reports mention Ratterdan incident
- Heard rumors of unusual crystalline companion
- Professional curiosity about Heartstone transformation

### Initial Reaction: Suspicious (Rolled 6)
**First Impression:**
- Wary of adventurers claiming to have dealt with Ratterdan shadows
- Torvin's letter prevents outright dismissal, but doesn't guarantee trust
- Needs convincing that they're competent and discreet
- Will test their knowledge and intentions before full cooperation

**What Earns His Trust:**
- Professional conduct and respect for artifacts
- Understanding the danger of what they're dealing with
- Willingness to follow proper containment procedures
- Protecting innocent bystanders over profit

### The Heartstone Recognition
**Why He Knows What It Is:**
- 20+ years cataloging and studying dangerous artifacts
- Office of Artifact Preservation maintains extensive Feywild artifact records
- Personally handled similar animation-magic items (none this powerful)
- Recognizes the specific crystalline transformation signature

**His Reaction:**
- Sharp intake of breath when he sees Bloody
- "That's... that's a Heartstone. Transformed. How in the Nine Hells did youâ€”"
- Immediately concerned about who else might want it
- Warns them about keeping it quiet (collectors, cults, worse)
- Respects that they haven't weaponized or sold it

## Role in Session 2

### The Situation
**Problem at Keeper's Sanctuary:**
- Temporal disturbances threatening artifact containment
- Keepers requested outside assistance (Merit Council involvement too heavy-handed)
- Office of Artifact Preservation has standing relationship with Keepers
- Thava authorized to hire independent contractors for discrete investigation

### Why He's Hiring Outsiders
- Merit Council official investigation would be bureaucratic and slow
- Keepers trust Office of Artifact Preservation, not enforcement
- Temporal anomalies require fast response
- Thava prefers competent field agents over political appointees
- Party's Ratterdan experience shows they can handle dangerous situations

### What He Offers
**Payment Structure:**
- 50 gp upfront (city discretionary fund)
- 150 gp upon completion and report
- Lodging covered during investigation (The Scholar's Rest inn)
- Access to Office archives if they need research support
- **Total:** 200 gp + expenses

**Resources Provided:**
- Letter of authorization to Keeper's Sanctuary

- His personal expertise on dangerous items

### What He Needs From Them
- Investigate source of temporal disturbances at Keeper's Sanctuary
- Ensure contained artifacts remain secure
- Report findings to him and the Keepers
- **Discretion:** No public panic, no bragging in taverns
- Professional conduct (Keepers are scholars, not soldiers)

### What He Doesn't Know
- Professor Zero's identity or Decimate Project existence
- Steel Dragon's human form identity
- Octavia's role in Ratterdan destruction
