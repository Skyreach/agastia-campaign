>
> "Inspector G... Geist. He comes every month. 'Inspection fees,' he calls it. Pay or he shuts down my shipments—claims 'irregularities.'"
>
> She looks defeated.
>
> "Other merchants pay too. We can't fight him—he's Merit Council. He works out of a warehouse near the docks, but what can we do?"
