## Knowledge About Garrek's Journal

### How She Acquired It
**20 Years Ago:**
- Garrek's estate was liquidated after he failed to return
- Mirella purchased the lot at auction (standard practice)
- Most items were standard adventurer gear
- **Key Find:** Partial journal fragments in his belongings

**The Journal Pages:**
- **Page 1:** Describes "metal book that won't open" near waterfalls
- **Page 2:** References "temporal anomalies in the deep"
- Both pages mention healing waters and strange time effects
- **Fragmented:** Water damage, burn marks, incomplete
- **Copies Made:** Mirella keeps originals, sells copies

### What She Knows
**About Garrek:**
- Famous explorer, died/vanished ~20 years ago
- Specialized in Underdark expeditions
- Found something significant before he died
- Estate sale suggested he died suddenly (no preparation)

**About the Journal:**
- Mentions underground waterfall with healing properties
- "Metal book bound to stone" that wouldn't budge
- Time flowed strangely near the location
- References to "guardians" but no specifics
- Garrek seemed both excited and frightened

**About the Codex:**
- Doesn't know specific name "Dominion Evolution Codex"
- Recognizes description if [[Manny]] provides it
- "Metal book, seven pages, bound to stone? Matches Garrek's notes."
- Has connected journal to a valuable artifact

### What She Doesn't Know
- Exact location of Garrek's Falls
- Temporal Bloodline Tribe (mentioned but not named in pages)
- Danger of the healing waters (addictive property)
- How Garrek actually died (assumed Underdark hazards)

## Interaction with [[Manny]]

### Initial Meeting
When [[Manny]] asks about the Codex or ancient artifacts:

> Mirella looks up from appraising a piece of old jewelry, her green eyes sharp and assessing.
>
> "[[The Codex]]? Interesting choice for a young scholar."
>
> She sets down her loupe and leans forward, elbows on counter.
>
> "I don't have the artifact itself - if I did, you couldn't afford it. But I DO have journal pages from an adventurer who found something like it."
>
> She pulls a lockbox from beneath the counter, producing two carefully preserved parchment pages.
>
> "Twenty years old, from a dwarf named Garrek. Mentions a metal book bound to stone, wouldn't budge. Near underground waterfalls. Time got 'weird' there, he said."
>
> She slides the pages just out of reach.
>
> "I'll part with copies for... let's say 25 gold. Or if you've got something INTERESTING to trade..."

### Negotiation
**Price:** 25gp for copies of both pages
- Firm on price, knows the value
- Will accept equivalent trade (magical items, rare reagents, valuable info)
- Won't haggle below 20gp ("I have other interested buyers")

**Alternative Payment:**
- Rare spell components (50gp value)
- Magical trinket or item
- Information about significant finds
- Promise of first refusal on future discoveries

**What [[Manny]] Gets:**
- High-quality copies of 2 journal pages
- Garrek's name and reputation
- General Underdark location hints
- Confirmation that metal book exists

### Follow-Up Services
**If [[Manny]] Buys:**
- "Come back if you find it - I'll pay for information"
- Offers to buy/fence any other artifacts party finds
- May reduce prices on future purchases (good customer)

**If [[Manny]] Declines:**
- "Offer stands. I'll be here."
- No hard feelings - business is business
- Pages may sell to someone else eventually

## DM Notes

### Mirella's Role
- **Paid Information:** Contrasts with Veridian's free academic knowledge
- **Choice Point:** Spend gold now vs wait for Thorne's free journal (Quest 3)
- **Black Market Contact:** Future fence for party's questionable loot
- **Pragmatic Counterpoint:** Business approach vs Veridian's enthusiasm

### The Choice
**If [[Manny]] Buys Pages Now (25gp):**
- Gets HEAD START on Codex quest
- Can research while doing other quests
- Thorne's journal (Quest 3) confirms/expands on info
- Shows [[Manny]]'s commitment to finding Codex

**If [[Manny]] Waits:**
- Saves 25gp for other purchases
- Gets full journal FREE from Thorne after Quest 2
- Delayed start on Codex investigation
- Can still buy pages later if impatient

### Connection to Other Content
**Garrek's Full Journal (Thorne's Quest 3):**
- Contains SAME information plus more details
- Includes map fragment
- Mirella's pages are genuine excerpts
- Buying now doesn't invalidate Thorne's quest

**Black Market Ties:**
- Knows [[Kex the Fence]] (rival smuggler)
- Aware of Geist's operation (stays neutral)
- Fences goods for various parties
- Useful contact for Kyle's investigation

### Secrets
- **Academic Rivalry:** Philosophical disagreement with Veridian
  - He preserves, she profits
  - Mutual professional respect
  - Occasionally compete for acquisitions
- **Council Bribes:** Pays modest fees to avoid inspections
  - Not involved with Geist (different territory)
  - Legitimate enough to avoid major scrutiny
- **Garrek Theory:** Suspects he found something valuable and died for it
  - Hopes someone finds it so she can buy/fence
  - Genuinely curious what he discovered

### Future Hooks
- Regular fence for party loot
- Source of rumors and artifact leads
- May commission party to retrieve specific items
- Black market connection in [[Agastia]]
- Could provide intel on underground economy

### If Party Returns with Codex Info
- Extremely interested in details
- Offers to buy information (50-100gp)
- Won't ask them to steal it (too dangerous)
- May connect them with interested buyers/scholars
- Relationship improves (valuable contacts)
