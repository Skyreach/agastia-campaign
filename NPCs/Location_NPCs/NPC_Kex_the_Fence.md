>
> His voice drips with bitterness.
>
> "Uses his [[Merit Council]] position to eliminate rivals like me. Had three warehouses and a dozen contacts. All gone."
>
> He leans in closer.
>
> "Works with someone higher up—never seen him, but [[Geist (Bandit Lieutenant)]] takes orders. Name's [[Kaelborn (Bandit Boss)]], or something like that. Warehouse 7, Pier District. That's the safehouse. You want to hit [[Geist (Bandit Lieutenant)]]? That's where you'll find him."

### What Kex Wants
**If Party Plans to Confront [[Geist (Bandit Lieutenant)]]:**
- Wants to know when it's happening (scavenge aftermath)

- May ask small favor later (deliver message, fence item)
- Wants first crack at any goods recovered from [[Geist (Bandit Lieutenant)]]

## Role in [[Geist (Bandit Lieutenant)]] Investigation (3-3-3-1 Web)

### Entry Node 3
**Function:** Underground perspective, reveals [[Kaelborn (Bandit Boss)]]
**Information Given:**
1. [[Geist (Bandit Lieutenant)]] is the PRIMARY smuggling boss (not just corrupt inspector)
2. [[Kaelborn (Bandit Boss)]]'s name (mysterious boss figure)
3. Warehouse 7 confirmation (operational base)

**Leads To:**
- Investigation Location 3 (Black Market / Informant Network)
- Reveals larger criminal hierarchy
- Connects [[Geist (Bandit Lieutenant)]] to mysterious [[Kaelborn (Bandit Boss)]]

### Reliability
- **Motivated:** Personal grudge ensures honesty
- **Limited:** Only knows street-level information
- **Bitter:** May exaggerate [[Geist (Bandit Lieutenant)]]'s power slightly
- **Useful:** Underground connections valid

## DM Notes

  - She doesn't deal with him anymore (too risky)

### Moral Complexity

- Fills need for goods unavailable through Merit system
- More sympathetic than typical criminal NPC

### Future Hooks
- Regular fence for party loot

- May ask party to eliminate new rivals
- Could involve party in scheme that backfires
- Connection to [[Dispossessed]] faction
