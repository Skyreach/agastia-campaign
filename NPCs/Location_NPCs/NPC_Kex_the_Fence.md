- Arrested Kex's contacts and suppliers
- Scared off customers with threat of investigation
- All under guise of "legitimate law enforcement"

## Knowledge About Geist & Kaelborn

### What Kex Knows (Firsthand)
**Geist's Operation:**
- Geist isn't just corrupt - he RUNS smuggling in Agastia
- Uses Merit Council position to eliminate rivals
- Warehouse 7 in Pier District is his safehouse
- Guards, enforcers, whole criminal network

**Kaelborn Connection:**
- Geist works for someone called "Kaelborn"
- Never seen Kaelborn, but Geist takes orders
- "The real boss, the one who stays hidden"
- Kaelborn's name mentioned when Geist's people talk

**The Operation:**
- Geist controls dock smuggling, protection rackets
- Council investigation of Geist goes nowhere (he's protected)
- Other criminals pay tribute to operate
- Geist uses confiscated goods to stock his own operation

### What He Doesn't Know
- Who Kaelborn actually is
- Where Kaelborn is located
- How high Council protection goes
- Full extent of smuggling network

## Interaction with Kyle (Investigation)

### Finding Kex
**Location:** The Depths, underground market (Tier 7)
**Requirements:**
- Ask about smugglers or black market
- Underground informant networks know him
- Streetwise or criminal contacts can locate

**Intimidation OR Persuasion DC 13:**
- Intimidation: Threaten to expose him to Geist
- Persuasion: Offer to take down Geist, common enemy

### Getting Information
Once convinced to talk:

> Kex spits on the ground.
>
> "Geist? That bastard ain't just corrupt—he's the BOSS of smuggling here."
>
> His voice drips with bitterness.
>
> "Uses his Merit Council position to eliminate rivals like me. Had three warehouses and a dozen contacts. All gone."
>
> He leans in closer.
>
> "Works with someone higher up—never seen him, but Geist takes orders. Name's Kaelborn, or something like that. Warehouse 7, Pier District. That's the safehouse. You want to hit Geist? That's where you'll find him."

### What Kex Wants
**If Party Plans to Confront Geist:**
- Wants to know when it's happening (scavenge aftermath)
- Offers to spread word in underground (distraction)
- Might provide minor assistance (information, contacts)
- Hopes Geist's fall lets him rebuild operation

**Payment:**
- Information is FREE (motivated by revenge)
- May ask small favor later (deliver message, fence item)
- Wants first crack at any goods recovered from Geist

## Role in Geist Investigation (3-3-3-1 Web)

### Entry Node 3
**Function:** Underground perspective, reveals Kaelborn
**Information Given:**
1. Geist is the PRIMARY smuggling boss (not just corrupt inspector)
2. Kaelborn's name (mysterious boss figure)
3. Warehouse 7 confirmation (operational base)

**Leads To:**
- Investigation Location 3 (Black Market / Informant Network)
- Reveals larger criminal hierarchy
- Connects Geist to mysterious Kaelborn

### Reliability
- **Motivated:** Personal grudge ensures honesty
- **Limited:** Only knows street-level information
- **Bitter:** May exaggerate Geist's power slightly
- **Useful:** Underground connections valid

## DM Notes

### Kex's Role
- **Underground Entry:** Criminal perspective on investigation
- **Reveals Hierarchy:** First mention of Kaelborn
- **Sympathetic Criminal:** Victim of Geist's monopoly
- **Potential Ally:** Wants Geist gone

### If Party Helps Kex
**After Geist Falls:**
- Rebuilds small operation in power vacuum
- Grateful to party (in his way)
- Fences party's questionable loot at good rates
- Provides underground intel and contacts

**Ongoing Relationship:**
- Not trustworthy, but useful
- Always looking for advantage
- Respects those who took down Geist
- Can become regular fence and informant

### Secrets
- **Council Informant:** Briefly worked as Geist's informant
  - Forced to spy on other criminals
  - Stopped when Geist betrayed him anyway
  - Deep shame about collaboration
- **Knows Mirella:** Has sold her questionable goods
  - She doesn't deal with him anymore (too risky)
  - Respects her business sense

### Moral Complexity
- Criminal, but victim of bigger criminal
- Not particularly violent (smuggling, fencing)
- Operates in Dispossessed community
- Fills need for goods unavailable through Merit system
- More sympathetic than typical criminal NPC

### Future Hooks
- Regular fence for party loot
- Underground information source
- May ask party to eliminate new rivals
- Could involve party in scheme that backfires
- Connection to Dispossessed faction
