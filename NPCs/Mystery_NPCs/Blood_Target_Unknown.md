# [[Blood Target (Unknown)]] (Unknown)

## Player Summary

[Players do not yet know about this individual]

## DM Notes

### Overview
This individual is the subject of a critical mission assigned to [[Nikki]] (Subject #8) by [[Professor Zero]]. Their blood is described as "key to Zero's plan," suggesting they possess unique biological, magical, or hereditary properties essential to the [[Decimate Project]]'s ultimate goals.

### What We Know
- **Bloodline Type:** TEMPORAL BLOODLINE - Descendants of lost civilization
- **Hidden Ability:** Blood can anchor/manipulate time
- **Connection:** Ties to Ratterdan ruins and temporal distortion themes
- **Why Their Blood:** Can stabilize the Dominion Evolution Codex's temporal manipulation properties
- **Search Status:** Active - [[Nikki]] tasked with finding them
- **Urgency:** Critical (assigned as primary mission)

### What We Don't Know (Yet)
- **Identity:** Name, race, age - completely unknown
- **Location:** Somewhere in [[Agastia]] (hasn't left the city)
- **Awareness:** Unknown if they know they're being sought
- **Self-Awareness:** Likely doesn't understand their own gift

### Temporal Bloodline Traits

**What Makes Them Special:**
- Descended from the lost civilization that created Ratterdan
- Blood carries temporal anchoring properties
- Genetic memory of pre-destruction timeline
- Natural resistance to temporal distortions

**Observable Traits (How [[Nikki]] Can Find Them):**
- Experiences unexplained déjà vu episodes (remembers "alternate timelines")
- Family history has gaps, inconsistencies, or contradictions
- Looks younger or older than they should for their age
- Unaffected by proximity to temporal anomalies (like Ratterdan ruins)
- Dreams of events that "haven't happened yet" or "happened differently"
- Knows things about Ratterdan's history that aren't in any book

**Why [[Professor Zero]] Needs Their Blood:**
- Codex manipulation requires temporal stabilization
- Their blood can "anchor" reality during evolution transformations
- Prevents timeline fracturing during Dominion Evolution
- Living link to pre-destruction timeline (before Ratterdan fell)

### Why Blood Specifically?

**Magical Properties:**
- Bloodline magic activation
- Ritual component
- Genetic compatibility
- Power inheritance

**Biological Uniqueness:**
- Rare mutation
- Hybrid heritage
- Disease immunity
- Age/immortality factor

**Symbolic/Metaphysical:**
- Prophecy fulfillment
- Bloodline curse breaking
- Soul-binding component
- Reality anchor

### Search Parameters

**What [[Nikki]] Knows (From Zero's Orders):**
- Seek someone who "carries the old timeline in their veins"
- They experience temporal anomalies (déjà vu, prophetic dreams, age discrepancies)
- Likely doesn't understand their gift (thinks they're going mad)
- Young adult (15-25 years old, easier to control)
- In [[Agastia]] (hasn't left the city)
- May have connection to Ratterdan or old families

**What Zero Hasn't Told Her:**
- True purpose: Stabilizing Codex's timeline manipulation
- What happens to target after extraction (probably fatal)
- Why [[Nikki]] specifically was chosen (test of loyalty? distraction from [[Manny]]?)
- Connection between Codex quest and blood quest (they're the SAME quest)
- Other subjects may also be searching (competition or cooperation?)

### Potential Complications

**Moral Dilemma:**
- What if target is innocent/good person?
- What if target is child?
- What if target is someone party knows?
- What if target doesn't survive blood extraction?

**Competing Interests:**
- Other factions also seeking them?
- Target has protectors?
- Multiple subjects assigned (competition)?
- Target is already dead/captured?

**Personal Stakes:**
- Target is [[Nikki]]'s family member?
- Target is [[Manny]]'s connection?
- Target knows truth about [[Decimate Project]]?
- Target can restore memories?

### Integration Points

**Session 1 Hooks (Clues & Leads for Tonight):**

**Clue Type 1 - Temple/Scholars:**
- "Young person asking about 'fixing time' at Temple archives"
- "Student corrected professor about Ratterdan's pre-destruction layout"
- "Claims to 'remember' walking streets that haven't existed for decades"

**Clue Type 2 - Healers/Temporal Madness:**
- "Patient with memories of events that never happened"
- "Talks about 'the other version' of their life constantly"
- "Age doesn't match appearance - temporal distortion"

**Clue Type 3 - Old Families:**
- "One of the founding bloodlines - genealogy doesn't add up"
- "Family records have gaps, duplicates, or contradictions"
- "Connected to Ratterdan's original settlement"

**Clue Type 4 - Street Rumors:**
- "That kid knows what Ratterdan looked like before the attack - impossible"
- "Talks about 'first timeline' like it's real"
- "Buys old Ratterdan maps, draws 'corrections' from memory"

**Session 1 Lead Options:**

**LEAD A - Caravan Companion:**
Fellow traveler mentions cousin in Temple archives:
- "She met a young scholar obsessed with temporal inconsistencies"
- "Insists Ratterdan's destruction happened differently in another timeline"
- "Old family name - connected to Ratterdan's founding"

**LEAD B - Patron's Aside:**
Patron casually warns about temporal anomalies:
- "I know someone who 'remembers' Ratterdan before it fell"
- "Probably mad, but descriptions match ancient texts"
- "Works in [[Scholar Quarter]] - you'll know them by the headaches"

**LEAD C - Gate Guards:**
Overheard discussion:
- "That kid who looks wrong came through yesterday"
- "Swear they were younger last week - time's playing tricks"
- "Temple scholars think they're touched by the ruins"

**LEAD D - Street Urchin:**
Kid selling information:
- "Someone pays for old Ratterdan maps, says they're 'wrong'"
- "Too young to have memories of the city, but draws details perfectly"
- "Hangs around [[Scholar Quarter]], near temporal magic section"

**Long-term Quest:**
- Parallel to Codex retrieval
- May require both to complete Zero's plan
- Creates tension: protect [[Manny]] vs. find target
- Opportunity for [[Nikki]] character development
