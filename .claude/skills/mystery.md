# Mystery Generation Skill - 3-3-3-1 Investigation Design

**Purpose:** Create fantasy mystery investigations using the 3-3-3-1 structure with proper clue design, player agency, and failsafe mechanisms.

**When to use:** Any investigation, conspiracy, or mystery-solving quest where PCs must uncover truth through gathering clues.

**Example:** Quest_Geist_Investigation.md (Starfall Anchor heist)

## Core Principles

### 1. Fantasy Setting Requirement
**Make it fantastical and matter!**
- Not mundane goods or low stakes
- Use magic, monsters, planar threats, faction conflicts
- Consequences if unchecked should be significant
- Examples:
  - ✅ GOOD: Stolen Feywild artifacts threaten dimensional breach
  - ❌ BAD: Stolen bread from bakery

### 2. The 3-Clue Rule (CRITICAL)
**Each conclusion needs 3 independent clues, each sufficient ALONE**

**What this means:**
- For any revelation you want PCs to reach, provide at least 3 clues
- Each clue must support the conclusion on its own and in full
- The 2 extras serve as backups if first clue doesn't survive contact with players
- Additional clues reinforce suspicions (this is desirable!)

**Common Mistake - DO NOT DO THIS:**
```
❌ BAD EXAMPLE (requires all 3 clues to combine):
Clue A: "The suspect is 6 feet tall"
Clue B: "The suspect wears a green sweater"
Clue C: "The suspect has gray hair"

Problem: Only works if EXACTLY ONE person in world is 6ft + green sweater + gray hair
This is actually THREE conclusions, each needing 3 clues
```

**Correct Approach:**
```
✅ GOOD EXAMPLE (each clue sufficient alone):
Clue A: "Signed confession found in suspect's handwriting"
Clue B: "Three witnesses saw suspect commit the crime"
Clue C: "Suspect's unique tool found at crime scene with fingerprints"

Why it works: ANY ONE of these proves guilt independently
```

### 3. Two Types of Clues

**REVELATIONS (What's happening):**
- Answer: Who, What, Why, When, Where
- Solve the mystery
- Build understanding of the situation
- Example: "Geist is corrupt" (multiple clues prove this)

**LEADS (Where to go next):**
- Point to investigation locations
- Continue the investigation
- May not solve mystery directly, but guide players
- Example: "Warehouse 7 address on crate" (points to location)

**Important:** Both types follow 3-clue rule, but in different ways
- Early investigation may have only leads (no revelations yet)
- Deep investigation eventually reveals truth
- Some clues can be BOTH (reveal truth AND point to next location)

### 4. No Red Herrings
**Red herrings are overrated - don't use them**
- Focus on multiple paths to truth, not false paths
- Player confusion comes naturally; don't manufacture it
- Every clue should be useful (even if indirectly)
- Exception: NPCs can be wrong, but make it clear they're speculating

### 5. Proactive Clues (Failsafes)
**If players get stuck, the villain acts**

**Semantically appropriate escalations:**
- New crime scene (another victim, robbery, ritual)
- Retaliation (thugs sent after party, witness murdered)
- Clue delivered (matchbook in thug's pocket, letter from informant)
- Time pressure (ritual starting, hostage deadline)

**Example from Geist Investigation:**
- Failsafe 1: Geist's thugs attack party → thug has Warehouse 7 matchbook
- Failsafe 2: Second smuggler dies → Cult safehouse address in pocket
- Failsafe 3: Augury publicly complains → Castle hires party
- Failsafe 4: Lord Zaos contacts Kyle → Patron grants Augury access

### 6. Player Agency (No Difficulty Scaling)
**Mystery stays the same regardless of PC level**
- Don't change clues based on party strength
- Don't remove locations if party is "too weak"
- Let players choose approach complexity
- Multiple solutions all equally valid
- Player choice matters; don't railroad

## The 3-3-3-1 Structure

### 3 Entry Points
**Different ways to discover the mystery**
- Each must be viable on its own
- Don't let one entry "moot" others
- Spread across different PC approaches:
  - Physical evidence (crime scene, crate)
  - Social evidence (NPC with info)
  - Underground evidence (criminal contacts)

**Example (Geist Investigation):**
1. Crate Scene - Physical evidence (dead smuggler, Feywild debris)
2. Mira Saltwind - Extortion victim with documents
3. Kex the Fence - Criminal underworld intel

### 3+ Investigation Locations (Flexible)
**Minimum 3 per entry, but can overlap**
- Each entry point leads to ~3 investigation sites
- Locations interconnected (form a web, not linear path)
- Central hub locations (many paths lead there)
- Peripheral locations (specialty intel)

**Example (Geist Investigation):**
- Entry Points: Crate, Mira, Kex (3)
- Investigation Sites: Warehouse 7, Augury, Merit Council, Cult Safehouse (4)
- Total locations: 7 (3 entries + 4 sites)
- Connections: All paths lead through Warehouse 7 (central hub)

### 3 Clues Per Revelation (Minimum)
**Each conclusion needs 3+ independent clues**
- Spread across multiple locations
- Each sufficient alone
- Additional clues as backups
- More clues = more robust mystery

**Example (Geist Investigation Revelation 2):**
Revelation: "Geist's organization intercepted shipment via dock clerk"
- Clue A: Dock records show Harren misrouted shipment (documentary)
- Clue B: Warehouse has thug evidence, not inspector gear (physical)
- Clue C: Mira testifies about Geist's pattern (witness)
- Clue D: Dock worker saw thugs loading crate (witness)
- Clue E: Augury says Geist closed investigation too fast (pattern)
- Clue F: Dead smuggler has shadow burns (physical)
Total: 6 clues for one revelation (robust!)

### 1 Final Conclusion
**All paths converge to same truth**
- Players can reach conclusion via different routes
- Some paths provide more/less information
- No "required" path to success
- Depth varies (2-3 successful leads typical)

**Example (Geist Investigation):**
All paths reveal: "Harren + Geist + Kaelborn conspiracy stole Starfall Anchors, sold to Chaos Cult"
- Fast path (2 leads): Crate → Warehouse 7 → Cult Safehouse
- Thorough path (3 leads): Mira → Augury → Merit Council → Warehouse 7
- Underworld path (3 leads): Kex → Warehouse 7 → Merit Council → Cult

## Mystery Design Process

### Step 1: Understand the Situation
**Answer: Who, How, Why, When, Where**

**Template:**
```
WHO (The Players):
- Primary antagonist(s):
- Accomplices:
- Victims:
- Buyers/beneficiaries:

HOW (The Method):
1. [Step by step what actually happened]
2. [Include timeline]
3. [Include how they avoid detection]

WHY (The Motivation):
- Antagonist's motivation:
- What do they gain?
- What are the stakes?

WHEN (The Timeline):
- When did crime occur?
- How long ago?
- Time pressure for resolution?

WHERE (Key Locations):
- Where did crime happen?
- Where is evidence?
- Where are antagonists now?
```

**Example (Geist Investigation):**
```
WHO:
- Harren Dockwise (dock clerk, 10% cut)
- Inspector Geist (corrupt inspector, 50% cut)
- Kaelborn (Dock Superintendent, 40% cut)
- The Architect (Chaos Cult buyer)

HOW:
1. Harren tips Geist about valuable shipment
2. Harren "misroutes" to Warehouse 7, marks "damaged"
3. Geist's thugs collect, unbox, find research papers
4. Geist contacts Chaos Cult buyer
5. 4 anchors sold, 2 in transit when smuggler dies

WHY:
- Greed (25,000 gp split)
- Chaos Cult needs anchors for ritual

WHEN:
- 5 days ago (theft)
- Today (crate discovery)

WHERE:
- Docks → Warehouse 7 → Cult Safehouse
```

### Step 2: Create Revelation List
**List all conclusions PCs need to reach**

**Template:**
```
REVELATION 1: [What PCs need to conclude]
Why this matters: [Why is this important to know?]

Clue 1A (Location): [Specific evidence]
- [Exactly what they find/learn]
- [How it proves the revelation ALONE]

Clue 1B (Location): [Different evidence]
- [Exactly what they find/learn]
- [How it proves the revelation ALONE]

Clue 1C (Location): [Third evidence]
- [Exactly what they find/learn]
- [How it proves the revelation ALONE]

[Continue for all revelations...]
```

**How many revelations?**
- Minimum: 3-5 core revelations
- Typical: 5-7 for complex mystery
- Each revelation = one piece of truth
- All revelations together = complete picture

**Example (Geist Investigation has 5):**
1. Starfall Anchors are valuable Feywild research artifacts
2. Geist's organization intercepted via dock clerk
3. Warehouse 7 is distribution hub
4. Harren + Geist + Kaelborn conspiracy
5. Anchors sold to Chaos Cult

### Step 3: Create Location List
**All places PCs can investigate**

**Template:**
```
LOCATION: [Name]
Type: [Entry Point / Investigation Site / Confrontation]
When available: [Timing/trigger]
What PCs find: [General description]

Available Clues:
1. [Clue name] → REVELATION X (or LEAD to Y location)
   - [Specific details]
2. [Clue name] → REVELATION X (or LEAD to Y location)
   - [Specific details]
3. [Clue name] → REVELATION X (or LEAD to Y location)
   - [Specific details]
[4-5 clues total recommended]

DM Notes:
- [Access requirements]
- [Challenges/guards]
- [Special considerations]
```

**Location Types:**
- **Entry Points (3):** Where investigation starts
- **Investigation Sites (4-6):** Where clues are found
- **Confrontation Site (1):** Where antagonist is confronted

**Example (Warehouse 7 from Geist):**
```
LOCATION: Warehouse 7 (Dock District)
Type: Investigation Site (central hub)
When: After any entry point provides address
What: Unboxing site, evidence cache

Available Clues:
1. Research proposal → REVELATION 1 (what anchors are)
2. Thug evidence → REVELATION 2 (Geist uses thugs)
3. Unboxing debris → REVELATION 3 (this is the hub)
4. Payment ledger → REVELATION 4 (H/G/K conspiracy)
5. Buyer letter → REVELATION 5 (Chaos Cult buyer)

DM Notes:
- May be guarded (2-4 thugs)
- Breaking in = crime (stealth OR social)
- Most evidence-rich location
```

### Step 4: Map Clue Flow
**Visualize how investigation connects**

**Create diagrams showing:**
1. Entry Points → Investigation Sites (how players navigate)
2. Clues → Revelations (redundancy visualization)
3. Example Paths (2-3 sample routes)
4. Proactive Clues (failsafe triggers)

**Use Mermaid flowcharts in quest documents**
See Quest_Geist_Investigation.md lines 381-441 for examples

### Step 5: Design Entry Point Balance
**Ensure no single entry moots others**

**Check:**
- ✅ Each entry provides different starting clues
- ✅ Each entry leads to different first locations
- ✅ No entry gives "complete" information alone
- ✅ All entries eventually connect (web structure)

**Example (Geist Investigation):**
- Crate → Points to Warehouse 7 OR Mira (player choice)
- Mira → Points to Augury OR Warehouse 7 (different than crate)
- Kex → Points to Warehouse 7 OR Cult (underworld route)
- All three eventually lead to Warehouse 7 (central hub) but via different paths

### Step 6: Plan Proactive Clues
**What happens if players get stuck?**

**For each potential stuck point, design:**
```
FAILSAFE X: [Name]
Trigger: [What causes this to activate]
Event: [What happens narratively]
Clue: [What new information becomes available]
```

**Timing:**
- Wait 1-2 sessions before activating
- Don't rush players
- Multiple failsafes for different stuck points

**Example (Geist Investigation has 4 failsafes):**
See Quest_Geist_Investigation.md lines 444-467

### Step 7: Test Flexibility
**Can players reach truth via different paths?**

**Validation questions:**
- ✓ Can players solve mystery if they skip locations?
- ✓ Do all revelations have 3+ clues?
- ✓ Are clues spread across multiple locations?
- ✓ Can players reach confrontation in 2-3 leads?
- ✓ Do entry points balance (no single dominant path)?
- ✓ Are failsafes in place if stuck?

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake 1: Single Entry Point
**Problem:** Only one way to start investigation
**Fix:** Design 3 different entry points (physical, social, underground)

### ❌ Mistake 2: Required Clue Combinations
**Problem:** Clue A + B + C needed to reach conclusion (violates 3-clue rule)
**Fix:** Make each clue sufficient alone to reach conclusion

### ❌ Mistake 3: Linear Investigation
**Problem:** Must go A → B → C → D in exact order
**Fix:** Create web structure where multiple paths lead to same locations

### ❌ Mistake 4: Difficulty Scaling
**Problem:** Changing mystery based on party level removes agency
**Fix:** Keep mystery same, let players choose approach complexity

### ❌ Mistake 5: Unclear Clue Flow
**Problem:** Can't visualize how investigation progresses
**Fix:** Create mermaid diagrams showing connections

### ❌ Mistake 6: No Failsafes
**Problem:** Players get stuck with no way forward
**Fix:** Design 3-4 proactive clues that activate if stuck

### ❌ Mistake 7: Mundane Stakes
**Problem:** "Find stolen bread" in fantasy setting
**Fix:** Make it fantastical with real consequences (Feywild artifacts, demon summoning, planar breach)

### ❌ Mistake 8: Entry Point Imbalance
**Problem:** One entry gives all information, moots others
**Fix:** Balance clues across entries, ensure all lead to different starting locations

### ❌ Mistake 9: Too Few Clues
**Problem:** Only 1-2 clues per revelation
**Fix:** Minimum 3 clues per revelation, 4-6 recommended for robustness

### ❌ Mistake 10: Red Herrings
**Problem:** False clues that mislead players
**Fix:** Remove red herrings, focus on multiple paths to truth

## Example: Geist Investigation Summary

**Mystery:** Who stole the Starfall Anchors and where are they now?

**Structure:**
- 3 Entry Points (Crate, Mira, Kex)
- 7 Total Locations (3 entries + 4 sites)
- 5 Revelations (26 total clues - very robust!)
- 1 Conclusion (H+G+K conspiracy, Chaos Cult has anchors)
- 2-3 Lead Depth (Fast: 2, Thorough: 3)

**Why it works:**
- ✓ Fantastical stakes (Feywild artifacts, dimensional breach)
- ✓ 3-clue rule followed (each revelation 3-6 clues)
- ✓ Balanced entries (no single path dominates)
- ✓ Web structure (all paths connect)
- ✓ Player agency (multiple solutions)
- ✓ Failsafes (4 proactive clues if stuck)
- ✓ Clear diagrams (3 mermaid flowcharts)

## Depth Gauge Question

**Always ask: "How many successful leads should players follow?"**

**Typical answers:**
- **Simple mystery:** 1-2 leads (quick resolution)
- **Standard mystery:** 2-3 leads (most quests)
- **Complex mystery:** 3-4 leads (major arc)
- **Campaign mystery:** 4+ leads (multi-session)

**For Geist Investigation:** 2-3 leads
- Fast path: 2 (Crate → Warehouse 7 → confrontation)
- Thorough path: 3 (Mira → Augury → Merit Council → Warehouse 7 → confrontation)

**Forgiving to PCs:**
- Don't short-circuit the flow
- Allow re-routing to different locations
- Can add leads if players need them
- Depth is guideline, not hard requirement

## Final Notes

**This structure is:**
- ✓ Flexible (players choose path)
- ✓ Robust (multiple backups)
- ✓ Fair (no gotchas)
- ✓ Engaging (meaningful choices)
- ✓ Fantasy-appropriate (stakes matter)

**This structure is NOT:**
- ✗ Railroading (forced path)
- ✗ Puzzle-box (one solution)
- ✗ Level-gated (difficulty scaling)
- ✗ Fragile (single point of failure)
- ✗ Mundane (low stakes)

**Remember:** The goal is a mystery players can solve through investigation, clever thinking, and making meaningful choices - not a puzzle they have to guess.

Make it fantastical. Make it matter. Give them options.
